    "**Sune-Network:**\n",
    "The Sune-network has a high frequency of nodes with degree 1, which makes sense since each new node connects to an existing node chosen randomly with equal probability. Many nodes will therefore have just a single edge after being added to the network. The degree distribution for the Sune-network also shows a long \"tail\" with a number of nodes that have higher degrees than 2. This might be because the nodes got selected several times when new nodes were added which would result in more connections than average. From the plot above one can also see that there is a peak at around degree 1 is a lot higher than in the ER-network. This suggests that there are more nodes in the Sune-network that have very few connections, which ultimately makes sense when thinking about the equal-probability attachment model.\n",

    "From the plot above we can see that the degree distribution for the ER-network seems to follow a somewhat poisson distribution, where the majority of nodes are between 1 and 3. It should also be noted from the plot that there are a lot of nodes with a degree of 0, which makes them isolated nodes. However, when thinking about this it actually makes sense since the ER network can generate disconnected components. This happens as the edges are placed randomly and can then result in some nodes not getting any edges.\n",

At first this might seem strange when comparing it to the ER-network, however, upon further thought this actually makes sense. This happens as the sune-network grows by connecting the new node to an already existing node randomly. This means that at all times the network will remain connected to every node, and even though the attachment happens randomly there is close to no chance that the nodes will stay isolated throughout or form small clusters.\n",

    "From the output above we see that the ER-network has 818 connected components. If we think about why this also makes a lot of sense. In the network each edge is placed totally at random between two nodes, which can lead to a lot of nodes that have very little or no connections as we also keep in mind that the network has 5000 nodes and 4999 edges. This may lead to many nodes being connected to eachother or simply in one massive component, but also creating isolated nodes or small groups that are disconnected. In this case with 818 connected components this likely means that there is one big connected component that contains nearly all of the nodes and then some nodes that are either isolated or in small groups."
