Socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro claimed on Monday that whoever wins the United States presidential election will have to engage in “good faith” dialogue with his authoritarian regime.

“In any case, whoever gets to the White House, be it Trump or Kamala, will have a Revolutionary Government in Venezuela, a Bolivarian Government, a Bolivarian people,” Maduro said, “with whom they will have to talk, dialogue and understand each other by the rules, always by the rules.”

“We will be here no matter. who wins up there. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of the United States. We simply observe, see, and maintain our path, which is to develop,” he added.

The Venezuelan dictator commented on the U.S. election during the latest episode of his weekly Monday evening television show With Maduro Plus. Maduro, who has repeatedly claimed that the United States seeks to overthrow his regime, said that he has been asked whether a Trump or Harris presidency would be the most convenient for Venezuela.

“What is convenient for Venezuela and Latin America is to maintain our own path, not to depend on anyone,” Maduro said, adding that he considers it invalid that “a Latin American leader calls to vote for a candidate in the United States or to get involved in the U.S. electoral process.”

The Venezuelan socialist regime, which maintains a strident anti-U.S. stance, is a key ally of China, Russia, and Iran in the region, in addition to other rogue regimes and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah.

Maduro once again alleged, without presenting evidence, that the United States is involved in a coup plot to oust him with the intention of imposing a “fascist model” in the country.

“The model that the [United States] empire has for the world and that they intend to impose with a coup d’état in Venezuela and that they intend to impose with destabilization in Venezuela, let there be no doubt, is a fascist model,” Maduro said.

According to Maduro, the purported “fascist model” is similar to what Argentine President Javier Milei and Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, both democratically chosen in uncontroversial elections, want to allegedly “impose” on their respective nations.

Following the collapse of socialism in Venezuela over the past decade, the Maduro regime has seen itself increase its dependence on anti-U.S. allies such as Iran, which has provided Venezuela assistance in repairing its derelict oil refineries, pushed to the brink of complete ruin as a result of more than two decades of socialist mismanagement.

Nicolás Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez as Venezuela’s socialist dictator after Chávez died from an undisclosed type of cancer in March 2013. Since then, Maduro has held onto power through several fraudulent elections, with the latest taking place on July 28, 2024 — Hugo Chávez’s birthday — leading to a new round of international condemnation and an unprecedented brutal crackdown of dissidents, including children.

United States authorities have accused Maduro of being a leading figure of the Cartel of the Suns, an intercontinental cocaine trafficking operation run by high-ranking members of both the Venezuelan military and the socialist regime that seeks to “flood” the United States with cocaine and “inflict the drug’s harmful and addictive effects on users in this country.” Since 2020, the United States maintains an active $15 million bounty for any information that can lead to Maduro’s arrest and/or conviction.

The numerous human rights violations committed by the Maduro regime against its own people over the years prompted the United States, under the administration of former President Donald Trump, to impose several sanctions on Maduro, his top brass, and the state-owned PDVSA oil company — the socialist regime’s main source of revenue — in 2019,

The Maduro regime has repeatedly claimed that the Trump-era sanctions — which some of Maduro’s friends such as Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro falsely claim are a “blockade” — are the cause of the collapse of socialism in Venezuela and its migrant crisis. In reality, the collapse of the country began long before Trump was first elected president. Last year, the Maduro regime claimed it would arrest and “try” Trump for his alleged crimes against Venezuela.

The Biden-Harris administration has taken a much different stance towards Venezuela, gifting Maduro and his regime several concessions that have allowed the cash-starved socialists to establish new economic lifelines.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent several years promoting the idea of legitimizing the Maduro regime by having Maduro commit to a “free and fair” election, leading to several rounds of “negotiations” between U.S. officials and representatives of both the Maduro regime and the Venezuelan opposition.

The negotiations concluded in October 2023 with the “Barbados Agreement,” a document signed by the Maduro regime and the Venezuelan establishment opposition under the observation of Blinken and the Biden-Harris administration.

The agreement called for the Maduro regime to hold a “free and fair” election sometime in 2024. In return, U.S. President Joe Biden awarded Maduro with a broad six-month-long oil and gas sanctions relief package that allowed PDVSA to freely sell oil and gas in U.S. and international markets such as China and India.

Maduro failed to uphold his vague promises and instead launched a brutal repression of dissidents ahead of the election and held the fraudulent July 28 presidential election, proclaiming himself the “winner” without showing any voter data to substantiate his claims.

In December 2023 the Biden-Harris administration also released Alex Saab, Maduro’s top money launderer and his key financial operative. Saab was arrested by United States authorities in Cape Verde 2020 and was undergoing trial proceedings on charges of using the U.S. financial system to launder $350 million from Venezuela’s state coffers.

According to the White House, sending Saab back to Venezuela would allegedly help curb the large flow of Venezuelan migrants entering the United States by addressing the “root causes of migration.” As of October, Saab, a Colombian national, has been serving as Maduro’s new Industries Minister.

In 2022, the Biden-Harris administration released Efraín Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, Maduro’s convicted drug-trafficking nephews more commonly known as the narcosobrinos (“narco-nephews”). The dictator’s nephews were arrested in November 2015 by DEA authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on charges of attempting to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine into U.S. territory.

Other concessions granted by the Biden-Harris administration to the Maduro regime include easing oil sanctions with a still-active license for California-based Chevron in November 2022 that allows the company to resume oil production and exports from Venezuela to the United States and the removal of sanctions on Carlos Erik Malpica Flores, another of Maduro’s nephews.

The intelligence community issued a public statement on the eve of the 2024 election to warn that foreign adversaries — “particularly Russia” — were conducting additional influence operations “intended to undermine public confidence in the integrity of the U.S. elections.”

The statement, by the Biden Administration Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, released Monday said:

Since our statement on Friday, the IC has been observing foreign adversaries, particularly Russia, conducting additional influence operations intended to undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans. The IC expects these activities will intensify through election day and in the coming weeks, and that foreign influence narratives will focus on swing states.

The agencies claimed, “Russia is the most active threat,” claiming it was manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to “undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC.”

They also claimed their efforts “risk inciting violence, including against election officials.”

“We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,” they wrote.

They claimed that “Russian influence actors” recently posted and amplified an article falsely claiming that U.S. officials across swing states plan to orchestrate election fraud “using a range of tactics, such as ballot stuffing and cyberattacks.”

“Russian influence actors also manufactured and amplified a recent video that falsely depicted an interview with an individual claiming election fraud in Arizona, which involved creating fake overseas ballots and changing voter rolls to favor Vice President Kamala Harris. The Arizona Secretary of State has already refuted the video’s claim as false,” the statement said.

The statement, coming just ahead of the 2024 presidential election, was greeted with skepticism from conservatives, including some who recalled the open letter in 2020 by 51 former intelligence officials who claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation and was used to censor discussion about it on social media.

The statement also mentioned Iran, who has been suspected of being behind pro-Gaza rallies in the U.S. and on college campuses, but also behind threats to former President Donald Trump’s life.

“Iran also remains a significant foreign influence threat to U.S. elections. As noted in a prior update, we have assessed that Iran has conducted malicious cyber activities to compromise former President Trump’s campaign. Iranian influence actors may also seek to create fake media content intended to suppress voting or stoke violence, as they have done in past election cycles. We previously reported that Iran also remains determined to seek revenge against select former US officials whom it views as culpable for the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) Commander Soleimani in January 2020. It has repeatedly highlighted former President Donald Trump among its priority targets for retribution,” it said.

“In light of continued influence efforts by foreign adversaries and the increasing volume of inauthentic content online, CISA recommends voters seek out information from trusted, official sources, in particular, state and local election officials,” it said.

The same Justice Department that threw a pro-Trump memesmith in prison for “election misinformation” is currently nowhere to be found after a left-wing group sent false election information to untold numbers of swing state voters.

In late October, Pennsylvania voters (many of whom hadn’t voted yet) received a text saying “Records show you voted. Find where to vote early by on-demand mail ballot.”(RELATED: Stream Daily Caller’s Original Documentary ‘RIGGED: Death Of The American Voter’)

Shortly after, they received another text reading “Apologies for the previous text, which was sent in error. If you have not voted yet, find out where to vote early by on-demand mail ballot.”

Both messages were signed “-AllVote”

AllVote claimed they did not intend to mislead voters, however others, like meme-maker Douglass Mackey, have been sentenced to jail time for “election interference” over similar incidents.

A spokesperson for AllVote, left-wing transgender activist Charlotte – formerly Charles – Clymer, claimed the message was a mistake.

“We are mortified by this mistake and the confusion it has caused,” Clymer said in a statement.

An AllVote spokesperson told The Washington Free Beacon the text messages only went to progressive voters, however, the Daily Caller confirmed with multiple registered Republicans and independent/unaffiliated voters in Pennsylvania and North Carolina that they had received the texts.

The DOJ has not prosecuted or made a statement on AllVote, though at least one state official raised a red flag. A government official in New Mexico said the texts are “something that the feds really need to look at and crack down on.”

The Caller reached out to the Eastern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, but has not heard back at the time of publication. The DOJ declined to comment.

None of the attorneys general in swing states where voters received the texts have publicly commented. Voters in Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin all received similar texts from AllVote, according to CNN.

The Caller reached out to their secretary of state offices but has not heard back at the time of publication.

Their silence contrasts sharply to the federal government’s efforts to punish Mackey.

Mackey was arrested by the FBI in Florida in 2021 for allegedly conspiring to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of New York announced on Jan. 27, 2021, that a “social media influencer” had been charged with “[disseminating] misinformation designed to deprive” people of their constitutionally protected right to vote. (RELATED: Biden DOJ Charges Pro-Trump Twitter Troll Over Posts Ahead Of 2016 Election)

“Mackey has been found guilty by a jury of his peers of attempting to deprive individuals from exercising their sacred right to vote for the candidate of their choice in the 2016 Presidential Election,” stated United States Attorney Breon Peace. https://t.co/JYht3grv2t

— US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) March 31, 2023

Mackey was convicted of “election interference” and sentenced to seven months in prison last year. Mackey, under the account “Ricky Vaughn,” posted a fake ad instructing Hillary supporters to vote by text.

The DOJ “tried very hard and spent millions of dollars” to try to find someone who failed to vote as a result of Mackey’s meme, James Lawrence, a partner with Envisage Law who represented Mackey, told the Caller.

The DOJ’s efforts extended “even to the point of subpoenaing the phone companies, getting the phone numbers that texted the number back in 2016 and going to the house of those people who got follow-up interviews,” Lawrence said.

“So first of all, it’s just a joke,” Mackey told the Caller. “I mean, people, I think my audience is going to find this funny. It’s also provocative in the sense that the other side or journalists could be offended by it and take it the wrong way.”

Mackey’s post included a photo of a black woman in front of an “African-Americans for Hillary” sign. The image included text saying: “Avoid the Line. Vote from Home,” “Text ‘Hillary’ to 59925,” and “Vote for Hillary and be a part of History.”

He subsequently tweeted an ad written in Spanish with an image of a woman typing into her cell phone, according to the DOJ. It included the Clinton Campaign’s logo and the slogan #ImWithHer. (RELATED: Anti-Hillary Election ‘Meme’ Case Could Open The Floodgates To More Gov’t Censorship, Legal Experts Warn)

Mackey got the images from 4chan, he told the Caller, and testified that he did not believe anyone would fall for them, according to his opening brief.

While Mackey stands alone in his prosecution, he does not appear to be the only person to suggest people could vote by phone.

On Nov. 8, 2016, left-wing influencer Kristina Wong posted a video with Trump signs in the background and posted the following message:

Hey 🇺🇸Trump Supporters🇺🇸! Skip poll lines at #Election2016 and TEXT in your vote! Text votes are legit. Or vote tomorrow on Super Wednesday! pic.twitter.com/ES34HV0yad — Kristina Wong 🍆 (@mskristinawong) November 8, 2016

Wong was not charged, and her post is still online. Jimmy Kimmel recently made a similar joke where he advised Trump supporters to “vote late,” leading many to note the political nature of Mackey’s charges.

Charles Clymer sent out his texts to thousands of actual voters. Jimmy Kimmel told his joke to an audience of millions. The joke meme I sent out didn’t even reach more than 100 people until Buzzfeed and Wired reported on it. https://t.co/uAMI9saL2i — Douglass Mackey (@DougMackeyCase) October 31, 2024

The Biden Administration sent Douglass Mackey to prison for making this exact joke. I’m dead serious when I say if Trump wins he should have Jimmy Kimmel arrested and jailed. Force these scumbags to live by their own rules. https://t.co/SMHtwwBlAQ — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 31, 2024

What’s striking to me is that Jimmy Kimmel has clearly never heard of Douglas Mackey or what the DOJ did to him. He’s completely unaware because mainstream media never reported it. Kimmel will wake up likely still unaware and unbothered by the justice department https://t.co/EqXmXmqKOj — Corey Inganamort 🪚🌴🪚 (@TheBirdWords) October 31, 2024

AllVote maintains their texts were an accident, but Mackey argued that if his prosecution went to the lengths they did to prove his intent, they should apply the same standard to AllVote’s case.

“Let me point out that the DOJ subpoenaed all my bank accounts, all my financial records, my employment history, my rent history, and all my direct messages to see if I had a criminal intent,” Mackey told the Caller.

“So this guy, Charles Clymer, he says that it was just an innocent mistake. ‘We did a typo,’ whatever. Well, by the same standard, the DOJ should be subpoenaing all his emails, all of his communications, his entire super PAC, all the records and internal communication to see if he had a criminal intent when he posted the meme by the same standard of justice, right?”

AllVote is accused of having Democratic funding sources. While the group appears to go to great lengths to conceal their funding, a Free Beacon investigation found their legal disclaimer was hosted by Rapid Resist Action, a group founded in 2017 by former Obama administration official Yoni Landau.

Rapid Resist Action counts among its donors Democratic billionaire Reid Hoffman, who donated $484,000 to them through his nonprofit American Future Republic in 2022, the Free Beacon found. (Stream the Daily Caller’s Documentary Rigged HERE)

“The evidence indicates that AllVote, is tied to a group called Rapid Resist Action, whose largest donor is Democrat megadonor Reid Hoffman,” the Capital Research Center’s Parker Thayer told the Caller. “Any group backed by Hoffman, who is notorious for funding left-wing political skullduggery and dirty tricks, should not be afforded the benefit of the doubt when it comes to allegations of voter suppression and misinformation.”

Hoffman, a known associate of deceased convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into pro-Democratic party and anti-Trump organizations throughout the years.

He’s previously been linked to left-wing disinformation campaigns, most notably a 2018 effort to help Democrat Doug Jones defeat Republican Roy Moore in the race for Alabama’s open US Senate seat.

“AllVote’s misleading text messages are another sign of the Left’s total desperation as election day looms. This cycle has seen left-leaning groups use underhanded tactics at an unprecedented level,” Thayer told the Caller.

“Groups have sent threatening mailers implying they will send people’s voting history to their neighbors, created websites advertising the ability people to stalk an ex-boyfriend’s voting history, and secretly filtered digital voter registration ads so that they’re not shown to swing state residents who enjoy things like NASCAR, the PGA Tour, and Duck Dynasty. AllVote’s text messages are just the cherry on top.”

While federal law enforcement has not targeted AllVote, Biden-Harris’s DOJ weaponized a KKK-era law to target Mackey.

Mackey was charged under the Conspiracy Against Rights statute, according to the DOJ. The statute is a Reconstruction-era law designed to protect the voting rights of recently enfranchised black voters, the Daily Caller previously reported.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, it has been weaponized against pro-life protesters, former President Trump, and now Douglass Mackey. (RELATED: Biden-Harris DOJ Weaponizes Hundred-Year-Old Anti-KKK Law Against Conservatives)

“It’s been used in Douglass’s case to go after speech online – speech online that didn’t cause a single person not to vote in the 2016 election, as far as what the government put on as evidence,” he said.

Mackey’s legal team argued the statute does not criminalize “political misinformation,” noting it is an entirely new method of prosecution, according to court documents. Lawrence agreed and emphasized the law has never been used to prosecute people for “engaging in pure speech” – until Mackey’s case. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: DOJ Data Confirms Conservative Fears Biden Weaponized Justice System)

The government’s key witness in the trial was an online troll known as “Microchip” who pleaded guilty to violating the conspiracy charge, according to legal documents. He initially denied there was a “grand plan” to prevent people from voting and informed the FBI his own tweets were jokes.

“He told [the FBI], there’s no grand conspiracy,” Mackey said. “It was just shit posting. He told them that it was just trying to cause chaos that caused the media to freak out, the Democrats to freak out. They kept interviewing him and twisted, essentially twisted his arm so that he would testify at my trial, and he just said exactly what they wanted him to say.”

“The Department of Justice breathes new life into a statute that’s been on the books for close to 150 years to prosecute Douglass Mackey and then they call that our democracy,” Lawrence told the Caller.
Joe Rogan, the massively popular podcaster who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2020 and signaled he would back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) were he to go the distance in 2024, long expressed reluctance about having President Donald Trump on his show.

Rogan finally gave in late last month and sat down for three hours with the Republican president for an interview that went viral despite YouTube's apparent censorship efforts. Although the titular host of "The Joe Rogan Experience" appeared receptive to Trump's various policy proposals and his commentary about the issues facing the nation, Rogan refrained from endorsing the president — until Monday night after Elon Musk detailed his own reasons for backing Trump.

Rogan noted after the nearly three-hour interview Monday that Musk, a former Democrat, made "the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear" and agreed with the tech magnate "every step of the way."

While their conversation was replete with indications that might account for why Rogan finally endorsed Kamala Harris' opponent — such as the falsity of both the Democrat-constructed Russian collusion narrative and the party's promise of change; Harris' censorial reflex and dislikable personality; economic woes; Democrats' failure or unwillingness to tackle crime; reckless government spending; the border crisis; the promise of Trump's "Make America Healthy Again" movement; and the slaying of Peanut the squirrel — Musk highlighted four key reasons Trump was the optimal choice.

To save America from a 'one-party state'

Musk, who has reportedly poured hundreds of millions of dollars into efforts to see Trump elected, emphasized that should the Republican candidate lose the election, America will in turn "lose the two-party system."

The tech billionaire reasoned that there are only a handful of swing states where the margin of victory is small, "often 10 or 20,000 votes."

Musk echoed the concern Rogan raised with Sen. John Fetterman on the previous episode, namely that "the Democrat administration has been ... importing vast numbers of illegal aliens into swing states."

"What we're seeing is triple-digit increases in the numbers of illegals in every swing state. Some cases, 700% increases. These are gigantic numbers," said Musk, stressing that these numbers are far in excess of what would be necessary to permanently lock swing states for the Democrats.

'If Trump doesn't win, this is the last election.'

"Once the swing states vote blue, there is no election anymore," continued Musk. "There's only a Democrat primary."

"Which is so crazy," Rogan responded. "And it's so crazy that people are fine with that."

Musk indicated that the ultimate result would be a "one-party state" whose Democratic commissars could continue the project of overwhelming resistive states with illegal aliens until the remaining resistance is electorally neutralized.

While the Tesla CEO intimated that amnesty might play a big role in this scheme, he indicated that illegal aliens will be able to put their thumbs on the scale long before receiving citizenship, referencing successful Democratic efforts to eliminate voter ID laws.

Steven Camarota, the director of research for the Center of Immigration Studies, noted in a recent op-ed that illegal aliens are also counted in the census, meaning blue states will enjoy greater and greater representation in Congress the longer the border crisis goes unchecked.

"If Trump doesn't win, this is the last election," reiterated Musk.

Rogan replied, "I think you're right."

To save the Constitution

Musk noted that there has been a concerted campaign by Democrats to infringe upon Americans' rights and to render the Constitution a dead document.

"There have been all these attacks on the Constitution, especially on the Democrat side. They have been repeatedly saying that the First Amendment is an obstacle," said Musk. "And they're claiming, 'Oh, the First Amendment is enabling disinformation, misinformation.' And I'm like, 'Yo, there's a reason for the First Amendment.'"

Democrats have been explicit about their problems with the First Amendment and the speech rights it guarantees.

Tim Wu, a former special assistant to President Biden for competition and tech policy and author of one of Biden's executive orders, complained in July that the "First Amendment is out of control" and recommended reining it in.

Former Biden-Harris climate czar John Kerry noted during a World Economic Forum panel discussion on trade and so-called sustainability in September that "our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just, you know, hammer ['disinformation'] out of existence."

The Biden-Harris administration has evidenced in practice its hostility toward free speech. For instance, it leaned on social media companies to silence dissenting voices during the pandemic; launched the Department of Homeland Security's short-lived Disinformation Governance Board and tasked an advocate for deplatforming Trump to run the censorship outfit; weaponized the State Department to clamp down on undesirable speech; and worked to control speech on the internet.

"If you don't have freedom of speech, you don't have democracy," Musk told Rogan. "If you don't have freedom of speech, people cannot make an informed vote. If they're just being fed propaganda, and there's no freedom of speech, democracy is an illusion."

Musk noted further that the Second Amendment — similarly under assault by Harris and her fellow Democrats — serves to ensure Americans can fight off those tyrannical forces that would dare undermine the First Amendment.

"I've had these debates, especially with people in L.A., because they want to take everyone's guns away, and I'm like, 'Yo, can you guarantee me that the government — that we'll never have a tyrannical government in the United States? Can you make that guarantee?' They're like, 'Well, nobody can make that guarantee.' I'm like, 'Then we need to keep our guns,'" said Musk. "Because that's what's going to stop it."

Harris' campaign website noted that if elected, she would "ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require universal background checks, and support red flag laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people."

In the past, Harris has threatened to storm the homes of law-abiding Americans for surprise gun inspections and sponsored a handgun ban.

To save America from suffocating regulation

Musk told Rogan that regulation has stymied innovation, such that it apparently takes longer for Space X to gain approval from regulatory agencies for a rocket launch than it takes to build the actual rockets.

When making his case for why a return to Trump's style of relative deregulation is optimal, Musk likened regulators to referees in a game of football.

"You don't want to have no refs. You want to have some number of refs. But you don't want to have way more refs than players," said Musk. "'Well, the running back couldn't complete the pass because there were too many regulators in the way because the football field was full of regulators.' Like, you can't even play the game."

Musk said in September that if Trump wins, "We do have an opportunity to do kind of a once-in-a-lifetime deregulation and reduction in the size of government."

To save America from foreign entanglements

The duo broached the subject of the left's desperate attempts to liken Trump to Adolf Hitler. Musk made a point of noting that Hitler is so despised because he committed genocide and effectively started war with Western civilization.

"Tell me about the wars and genocide that Trump did. Uh, I don't remember that, and he was president for four years," said Musk. "It's insane. It makes no sense."

Rogan noted, "He's campaigning on stopping all the wars. It's like his primary concern."

'Vote like your life depends on it because I think it does.'

"Exactly! The war mongers like Liz Cheney hate him," added Musk. "Because they love war. ... They profit off of war."

Former Jan. 6 committee member Liz Cheney and her father, Dick Cheney — a champion of the invasion of Iraq, which cost thousands of U.S. service lives and trillions of dollars — are among the interventionists who have backed Harris. Harris and Cheney recently denounced Trump's "isolationism," calling his aversion to foreign entanglements "dangerous."

Rogan indicated that he felt a sense of cognitive dissonance when the left celebrated Dick Cheney's Harris endorsement: "It's the craziest turn — the craziest 180 I've ever seen in my life."

"Yeah, can we play all the videos where you said Dick Cheney was the devil?" Musk replied, laughing.

"The war-profiteers hate Trump," said Musk. "Which is f***ed up. ... We should be like, 'Yeah, let's vote for the guy war-profiteers hate. That sounds like a great idea.'"

The tech billionaire noted further that the "Kamala puppet regime" is a guarantee for more war.

Musk concluded the interview by emphasizing the "men need to vote."

"This is a message to the men out there: Vote like your life depends on it because I think it does," said Musk. "Nothing is more important."

The Walz-Harris ticket would bring a “serious setback” to the U.S. by implementing a radical left-wing agenda nationwide if elected, according to Minnesota’s GOP chairman, citing Gov. Tim Walz’s (D-MN) “hyper-partisan” and overly progressive record as a warning for the country.

With the 2024 election here, Minnesota Republican Party Chairman David Hann raised alarms over the potential impact of a Harris-Walz administration, warning that it would expand “extreme left” policies nationwide and worsen challenges in areas like the economy and immigration.

“We hope, and are actively working to ensure, this doesn’t happen,” Hann said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Monday, expressing concerns about high crime rates, economic challenges, and a growing partisan divide under Walz’s leadership.

Hann described the Democrat vice-presidential nominee’s record as a red flag for national governance, especially on issues of crime and economic policy.

“He, and the Harris administration in general, would be a serious setback for the country,” Hann stated. “We would see a continuation of the kinds of policies we’ve gotten under President Biden, which have been economically negative.”

“We also have problems with our border that would be exacerbated,” he added. “And in terms of foreign policy, the way that the Biden administration has handled it has not been helpful either.”

The chairman criticized Walz as “hyper-partisan,” alleging that he leveraged slim Democratic majorities in Minnesota’s legislature to push through “extreme left-leaning” policies.

“Governor Walz has not governed the state in a very productive way. He’s been very, very partisan — hyper-partisan — maybe the most partisan governor that we’ve ever had in Minnesota,” Hann remarked, adding that Walz’s policies alienate the state’s moderate voters.

Citing Walz’s response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots as a turning point, Hann said the governor delayed deploying the National Guard “for political reasons,” which he argued contributed to ongoing crime issues.

“It wasn’t until pressure was put on the governor politically to call the National Guard … Even the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis was trying to get him to do it, but he wouldn’t,” Hann stated, adding that Minneapolis continues to see high crime rates and school district struggles in the wake of those riots.

Hann warned that Walz’s policies on sanctuary cities, lenient law enforcement, and public spending could be a “drag” on the Harris ticket and a potential liability for Democrats nationally.

“I’d say [Walz’s] policies are certainly further left than Joe Biden,” he said. “And when you have legislative majorities that were won by a few hundred votes, to push through real party-line, extreme policies … I think it’s devastating. It doesn’t bring about confidence in government.”

Hann expressed surprise that Harris even chose Walz as her running mate, interpreting it as a sign that Democrats believe Minnesota is “in play.” He noted that initial polls showed Harris’s lead over former President Donald Trump narrowed after Walz joined the ticket.

“We haven’t seen enthusiasm for Walz. He has been pretty much absent in the campaign,” Hann explained, emphasizing that independent voters in Minnesota favor GOP control of the state House.

As the GOP aims to secure at least one chamber of Minnesota’s legislature, Hann remains hopeful that both state and national voters will opt for a new direction on Election Day.

He concluded by warning that, under a Harris-Walz administration, the country would see the kinds of extreme partisan policies that have caused real harm in Minnesota — but on a “national level.”

The matter comes amid growing concerns that the Walz-Harris ticket may be far more radical than it appears, with deep connections to far-left progressive and socialist movements hinting at a potential shift toward more extreme policy positions if the Democrats are elected.

Walz’s political journey is rooted in his involvement with a progressive training camp inspired by the radical vision of Paul Wellstone, a professor-turned-politician with close ties to the Democratic Socialists of America and strong influences from Marxist figures and extreme far-left ideologies.

In September, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) posited that Vice President Kamala Harris adjusted her positions to be “pragmatic” in order to “win the election” during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, maintaining that she has not abandoned her progressive ideals.
If Democrats had their way, Donald Trump wouldn’t be anywhere near the presidency again. So wrote MSNBC’s Hayes Brown on the eve of the 2024 election’s final day. But Trump is near the presidency — perhaps by decisive margins — and Democrats are apoplectic.

The “biggest contributor to the unease that millions of Americans have felt as Election Day approaches,” Brown wrote, is “that there is any tension about the outcome at all. The 2024 election should not be anywhere near as close as it appears, not with Trump’s name on the ballot for the third straight election.”

Brown is right that the election shouldn’t be close, but he’s wrong about why.

The best thing for the country would not be a big or small victory for Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and their phony “unity” schtick. It wouldn’t even be a razor-thin Trump-Vance win. The best outcome for the health of our nation — and democracy — would be a landslide victory for Donald Trump.

First, and most importantly, America needs a decisive victory to communicate to Democrat leaders, media propagandists, bureaucratic tyrants, violent rioters, Big Tech censors, race hustlers, and rogue three-letter agencies that their underhanded and often illegal actions will not be rewarded with electoral victory.

No, Democrats don’t deserve to win after waging unprecedented lawfare against their political opponents, from the former president to peaceful pro-life protesters. They don’t deserve to win after turning federal agencies into a Democrat get-out-the-vote hydra. Or after lying about the integrity of the 2020 election and persecuting honest Americans who questioned the procedures and results. Or after inciting racial violence that razed pockets of flyover America and then lying that the rioting and looting was “mostly peaceful.”

Democrats don’t deserve to win after airing blatant and thoroughly debunked propaganda on network television 24/7/365. Or after colluding with Big Tech oligarchs to throttle true opinions they don’t like as “misinformation.” Or after raiding Donald Trump’s home over an alleged documents crime less severe than his rival Joe Biden’s.

Democrats shouldn’t be able to win after lying about the physical fitness of their commander-in-chief and staging an undemocratic coup when it became clear he couldn’t beat Trump. They shouldn’t be able to win after lying about violent crime statistics and employment numbers.

Democrats shouldn’t get to smear their opponents as racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, Nazi, fascist garbage deplorables but pretend to be standard-bearers of “unity” and “decency” and be rewarded with a “W.”

Amid all these factors, there’s also the ongoing unspoken threat that Democrat activists hang over the heads of the rest of the country. It’s simultaneously infantile and violent: If we don’t get our way, we’ll make your life miserable. Once again, as voting comes to a close, business establishments in America’s urban centers have boarded up their windows, and we all know it isn’t in anticipation of a Harris-Walz win. It’s to minimize the tantrum damage if the Trump-deranged leftist toddlers don’t get their way.

This time around, though, the imagery isn’t just of an unruly child screaming on the floor of a grocery store after being denied a piece of candy. It’s of a kid who taunts and antagonizes his older siblings until they’ve had enough and counterstrike.

It’s that simple, really: Only a Trump blowout will communicate the degree to which Americans are done with Democrats’ dirty tricks.

Fast Results

Second, for faith in our democratic process, it’s detrimental for Americans not to know the election results on election night. A decisive Trump victory, however, could give us a quick and confidence-boosting conclusion.

The “new normal” of days-long ballot counting isn’t normal at all. Just eight years ago, in a New York Times documentary about the contested 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Jeffrey Toobin, best known for pleasuring himself on a work Zoom call, said, “The one thing no one expected in a presidential campaign is that we wouldn’t know who won on Election Day.” Now The New York Times is preparing voters not to know the results right away, saying, for instance, that “Pennsylvania is likely to take longer than election night.”

Anti-Trump secretaries of state are saying the same. In addition to Pennsylvania’s Al Schmidt, two other swing-state election chiefs — Georgia’s Brad Raffensperger and Michigan’s Jocelyn Benson — have gone on the air to make excuses for why they may not have votes tallied on election night. As my colleague Brianna Lyman wrote, this is despite election-night results being “the norm in America for decades” and still being “the norm in many much larger states.”

Delays in vote tallies sow massive distrust in our democratic process. Just four years ago, in the dead of night while most voters and journalists were asleep, something shady happened in Michigan and Wisconsin. As my colleague John Daniel Davidson wrote at the time, in both swing states, Trump led on election night. And in both states, overnight dumps of mail-in ballots went 100 percent for Biden and precisely zero percent for Trump. Those who pointed out this seemingly statistical impossibility on Twitter were censored.

Of course, a landslide Harris victory could produce a quick result too, but there’s one more factor she absolutely can’t deliver best for the American people.

A Better America

Finally, Trump’s policies will obviously be better for Americans than Harris’, and we all know it. Despite Democrats attempting to brand Harris as the “change” candidate, we’re living under her “leadership” right now, and it’s a nightmare. From a failing economy to the border crisis to deadly foreign policy and a war on the First Amendment, the Biden-Harris administration has made Americans less free, less safe, and less secure in the future. The only thing she has to offer voters is on-demand elective abortion and that she’s “not Donald Trump.”

On the contrary, we all remember life under Trump, and despite the media squawking nonstop, it was a relatively peaceful and prosperous four years. No new wars, a more secure border, a booming economy, affordable homes, flourishing families, and pride in our great country — this was Trump’s America. And Democrats deserve to be reminded of it, not just by a marginal loss but by enormous defeat.

A Trump victory this week would spare suffering Americans from living in Biden-Harris hell. But the best thing for the country — for justice, democracy, and everyday living — would be not just a win but an absolute blowout.
The FBI has a big transparency problem. For a year, the media has been using the FBI’s estimates of reported crime to claim that crime has been falling. When the FBI released its numbers for 2023 in September 2024, it hid that it had revised its earlier crime data for 2021 and 2022, hiding the increase in 2022 and that there had been a net increase in crime over 2022 and 2023. Just days before an election in which crime has been a major issue, the FBI continues to hide the revisions.

On Thursday, House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., demanded that the FBI explain why it hid this increase even as Democrats and the media have been citing the claimed drop to bolster their election chances.

In responses to reporters over the past couple of weeks, the FBI has claimed: “The FBI stands behind each of our Crime in the Nation publications. In 2022, the estimated violent crime rate decreased 1.7 percent from 2021.”

But the FBI’s revised numbers are clear. The FBI originally reported in October 2023 that the number of reported violent crimes fell from 1,253,716 in 2021 to 1,232,428 in 2022 — a 1.7 percent drop. The numbers released later, in September 2023, showed a rise from 1,197,930 in 2021 to 1,256,671 in 2022 — a 4.9 percent increase. That is a 6.6-point swing.

The FBI didn’t explain the reason for the changed numbers in 2022 in their report nor in their responses to the media. As a former editor for USA Today, David Mastio, wrote about the FBI’s response to inquiry: “Here’s what I’ve learned in decades of covering Washington: When bad news is false, agency press people go out of their way to make it crystal clear that reports are definitely not true. When bad news is true, agency press people spew a wall of fog and bury you under an avalanche of distractions or in this case, contradictions.”

The FBI’s unwillingness to explicitly acknowledge what their own data clearly shows gives the legacy media an excuse for not recognizing the obvious increase in crime.

(The change in the estimated reported violent crime rate, which adjusts for the population changes, is similar and went from a drop of 2.1 percent to an increase of 4.5 percent.)

The increase in 2022 is greater than the FBI’s current estimated drop in reported violence in 2023. The revised numbers show that there were 20,537 more reported violent crimes in 2023 than in 2021.

The FBI ignored mentioning these revisions in its September 2024 press release. The FBI’s “Summary of Crime in the Nation” report contained a one sentence footnote on page 11 that vaguely stated: “The 2022 violent crime rate has been updated for inclusion in CIUS, 2023.” The footnote failed to mention that the numbers increased. One only sees the change by downloading the FBI’s new crime data and comparing it to the file released last year.

“The FBI’s failure to accurately report crime data and be transparent regarding revisions is unacceptable,” notes Comer’s letter to the FBI. Comer demanded “all documents and communications between the FBI and the White House related to the 2021, 2022, and 2023 Crime in the Nation statistics.”

Better Data

The FBI doesn’t simply count the number of crimes reported to police. Some police departments only partially report their data, and others don’t report any data. The FBI doesn’t assume that there were no crimes for those departments; it makes guesses, and how it does so can change.

However, there is better data on crime than the FBI’s. It’s important to distinguish reported crime from total crime.

For decades, we have known that most crimes aren’t reported to the police. So the U.S. Department of Justice set up the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which surveys 240,000 people each year about whether they have been victims of crime. The NCVS provides a measure of total crime that includes both reported and unreported crime.

The results of the 2023 NCVS, released in mid-September, tell a very different story. From 2019, before Covid, to 2023, NCVS shows a 19 percent increase in rape, robbery, and aggravated assaults. Over just the course of the Biden administration, there was an incredible 55.4 percent increase, though there were many issues that were unique to 2020 due to Covid.

The media and Democrats have focused solely on the FBI data, presumably because they show the desired pattern in crime. But when the FBI secretly revised its data, corporate media refused to run stories acknowledging that the headlines they ran over the last year were wrong.

The politicization of the FBI is aiding Democrats in making these claims.
Bernie Marcus, the founder of Home Depot, has died at the age of 95, the company announced on Tuesday.

The man who helped America build itself by providing a one-stop-shop for building materials and household goods was a revered figure in the business community, a frequent commentator on cable news, and a strong supporter of Donald Trump’s campaigns for president. “He was a master merchant and a genius with customer service,” the company said.

Marcus was born into an immigrant Jewish family, and attended pharmacy school at Rutgers University. He entered the business world — and, like many, his career was launched when he was fired from his corporate job. At the age of 49, he formed a partnership with friends Arthur Blank and Ron Brill, and found funding from investor Ken Langone, for a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers.” He opened the first Home Depot in Atlanta, and it was a major success.

Home Depot provided more than a convenience: it also created its own miniature economy. It allowed millions of people to start their own contracting businesses. It also became a gathering place for tradesmen looking for work as day laborers — a sign of the country’s growing immigrant population, both legal and illegal. During the coronavirus pandemic, when many other retail stores were closed, Home Depot was also a social lifeline for many Americans.

Marcus, as the company’s obituary noted, gave extremely generously to charity, observing the Jewish tradition of tzedakah, which is translated as “charity” but is more closely related to the word tzedek, for “righteousness.” Marcus, whose net worth was estimated at $11 billion, donated $250 million to build Atlanta’s aquarium, and said in 2019 that he planned to donate the rest of his wealth to charity — as well as to the cause of reelecting Donald Trump.

In 2016, when support for Trump was still deeply controversial, Marcus penned an op-ed in RealClearPolitics explaining his reasoning: “I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners,” he wrote. Marcus noted that he supported Trump despite having backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the GOP primary.

Marcus backed Trump throughout his presidency, criticizing Democrats who had rejected Trump’s pro-growth tax reforms in 2017. “You’ve got to use your brains,” he said, dismissing those who claimed that Trump’s tax cuts had not produced rapid growth after just a few months. “[Corporations] are going to do smart things. They are going to make smart moves, and that will take a period of time, just like the small businesses.” Time proved his predictions right.

During the pandemic, Marcus praised Trump’s decentralized response, which allowed states to experiment with their own policies. He endorsed Trump for reelection in a Fox News op-ed, adding: “While Democrats try to blame Trump for the roughly 220,000 disease victims, far more would have perished if Joe Biden were in office.” Once again, he was right: more Americans died from COVID under President Biden, even with the benefit of coronavirus vaccines.

Marcus backed Trump again in 2024, writing in RealClearPolitics: “For the first time in my 94 years on earth, I fear for the future of our democracy. … The world has also changed since 2020. It is much less safe … the different factions of the Republican Party must unite behind Trump.”

It is tragic, but perhaps poetic, that Marcus’s passing should have come on Election Day 2024, as Americans headed to the polls, to save the country Bernie Marcus helped them build.

President Joe Biden won’t be attending Vice President Kamala Harris’ election party, opting instead to watch the results pour in from the White House, an administration official told NBC News.

While Harris and her team host a watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, Biden will be surrounded by the first lady and longtime officials and aides, a White House official told NBC News. The president has no public events planned after he spent Saturday doing one final campaign event in Pennsylvania.

In the final weeks of the campaign, the Harris campaign sidelined a Biden eager to help them, three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios. Every time Biden’s team asked to hit the campaign trail aside the vice president, they were hit with the same message, “we’ll get back to you,” the sources told the outlet.

The campaign’s hesitancy came from believing that the president is a liability politically, Axios reported.

“He’s a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,” a source familiar with the situation told Axios.

After Axios’ report that Biden was being cast to the side by the Harris campaign, the president ignited a firestorm during Harris’ closing arguments. Sitting just about a thousand feet from Harris’ rally on the Ellipse, Biden called Trump supporters “garbage” while on a get-out-the-vote with Voto Latino. The president was responding to comments made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe during a Trump rally in which he equated Puerto Rico to a “floating island of garbage.” (RELATED: Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site)

“Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community. He’s failed businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends he had and accumulated wealth for those at the top,” Biden said in the video.

“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been,” he continued.

The White House attempted to clean up the remark, saying the president did not mean “supporters” but rather “supporter’s” in reference to Hinchcliffe. It wasn’t enough as Biden’s Twitter account released a statement in an attempt to provide additional clarification. (Stream Daily Caller Original Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

Harris was then asked to answer for the comments before hitting the campaign trail the next day.

“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.

“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.
It’s Election Day 2024, and Americans across the country are beelining for the ballot boxes to ensure their voice is heard — and praying that their voice matches the masses.

Stu Burguiere of “Stu Does America” accurately predicted the unfavorable outcome of the 2020 election, and he’s here to calm the minds of those dropping a vote for former President Donald Trump in 2024.

“Gun to my head here, it’s time to make last-minute predictions,” Burguiere says. “We’re going to give Georgia and the 16 electoral votes over to Donald Trump.” While Trump only has a slight but consistent polling lead in Georgia, Burguiere explains that “the fundamentals of the state lean a little bit red.”

Stu also predicts that North Carolina, a state whose citizens are still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, will vote in favor of Trump.

“Donald Trump wins North Carolina with 16. Again, same situation roughly as Georgia, it’s a very close state, it could go either way,” he explains. “But I think Donald Trump again, with a small but persistent lead in the polls, holds onto North Carolina in a very close margin.”

He believes the clearest state going to Donald Trump is Arizona, with 11 electoral votes.

“It’s still a traditional red state,” Stu says, before setting his sights on Nevada.

“This is one of these states I went back and forth on multiple times,” he explains. “I wound up going with Kamala Harris winning Nevada with 6 electoral votes. OK, I know everyone loves that, they love when I pick Kamala Harris in these states.”

Stu believes that the traditionally blue state of Michigan will go to Kamala Harris, and Wisconsin will go to Donald Trump.

Pennsylvania, the biggest swing state, is the most concerning — but if Stu is right — he has good news.

“I’ve decided to put Donald Trump in control of those 19 electoral votes,” he says. “The final count, Kamala Harris, 247 electoral votes. Donald Trump, 291 electoral votes. All of that to say that the official prediction of the ‘Stu Does America’ program, with incredibly limited confidence, is Donald Trump.”

“Donald Trump becomes the second president in history to have a presidential term, take one off, and then get the gig back,” he adds.

Just 21 days before the start of early voting, Hurricane Helene delivered biblical-level destruction to the hills, hollows, and mountains of North Carolina. The massive storm brought devastating floods that killed 232 people — half of them in this state — and buried entire riverside communities in rivers of mud.

Now, residents struggle for basic supplies. More than 2,500 families are homeless. Crowded shelters are well above capacity. Hundreds of road and bridge closures are disrupting transportation and the delivery of crucial aid.

One-fifth of the state’s 7.3 million registered voters reside in the disaster area. Are candidate visits and pledges of support resonating with voters?

Two days after the storm, Gov. Roy Cooper requested a major disaster declaration from the federal government in order to surge assistance to state and local agencies and provide immediate relief to suffering North Carolinians. FEMA claimed in a news release that it sent 25 trailer loads of food and 60 trailer loads of water to North Carolina. But Hendersonville resident Andrea Corn says she has not seen a state or federal worker yet.

After the storm, Corn — a 55-year-old accountant who is more accustomed to preparing tax forms for local businesses than organizing relief missions — formed an ATV group to rescue elderly victims in Henderson County. Most roads and bridges had crumbled or washed away, and many folks could be reached only by going off-road.

Andrea and her husband, a volunteer fireman, brought supplies to victims stranded in remote “hollers.” Many residents were without power for more than a month following Helene’s visit. Samaritan’s Purse, a nondenominational evangelical Christian charity, distributed solar-powered lights to light the dark nights.

Abandoned by the state

Well before the storm hit, these Western North Carolina mountain towns were imbued with a culture of self-reliance. Residents call it “WNC Strong.” But in the wake of Helene, residents needed critical help that only government can supply: large-scale search and rescue operations, power and water restoration, and infrastructure repair.

Today, many of these residents feel abandoned by state and federal government officials. One question looming over the recovery efforts is whether it will impact voting behavior in Tuesday’s elections. “They are supposed to stand up for us, and we feel forgotten,” Corn said. “We’re going to need lots of money to recover, and our government is sending it to Ukraine.”

Chuck Edwards, Republican congressman representing Western North Carolina, said state emergency officials cannot account for the whereabouts of 400 pallets of FEMA-supplied food and water meant for hurricane relief. He has requested 1,180 FEMA trailers to house thousands of displaced people.

In Buncombe County, local artist and photographer Anna Hitrova said that volunteers — not government workers — brought her necessary supplies after the storm. “The only people I’ve seen on the ground in Buncombe,” she said, “are churches and Samaritan’s Purse.”

Hitrova said she had a “black-pilled moment” when she drove through neighboring Swannanoa. She saw families camping on the lots where their homes once stood. They were without generators, phones, or anything else. “It was a shock; I was crying,” she explained. “It hit me how bad it was to be cut off from the world. The government waited to respond while people were dying.”

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has reported that most of the state’s deaths were in Buncombe County, home of Asheville and Swannanoa. “When I found out that FEMA had used money for housing illegal migrants and saw our government giving billions to Ukraine while families were getting $750, I was furious,” said Hitrova.

Some assistance came from unlikely sources. Billionaire Elon Musk, for instance, stepped up to help. The SpaceX CEO donated 500 Starlink internet receivers to groups across the devastated area. Musk’s donation came after the urging of local state Rep. Danny Britt and former President Donald Trump.

“Here, people had lost their homes and had nothing, but they had painted signs that read ‘God Bless Elon,’” Hitrova said. “I realized that Elon gave these people a lifeline that the government could not.”

Election Day implications

North Carolina is a key battleground state with 16 electoral votes. Trump won the state narrowly in 2016 and by an even smaller margin in 2020. The current RCP average has the former president leading by only 1.5 points. Both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have visited the storm-ravaged region while campaigning.

During her Oct. 5 visit, Harris met with Asheville’s mayor and leaders of progressive groups such as NC Counts. After attending a local FEMA briefing, the vice president praised state and federal workers for the “nobility of their work and their calling.”

Two weeks later, Trump appeared at an Asheville recovery site flanked by Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, an area native, and numerous North Carolina politicians and local business owners.

The former president said the American people were the real heroes of the recovery efforts and that the state and local governments had let storm victims down. Trump said he had come to express a simple message to the region: “I’m with you, and the American people are with you all the way.”

One-fifth of the state’s 7.3 million registered voters reside in the disaster area. Are the visits and pledges of support resonating with voters? In Henderson, a predominantly red county, it appears so. “I was shocked to see the level of highly motivated people out here voting this year despite their difficulties,” said Henderson County GOP Chair Brett Calloway.

Andrea Corn said that access to voting was the number-one concern for Helene victims. “Some folks needed food, others had lost their home, and the first thing they were asking about was voting,” she said. “It was truly all that mattered for them.” Some residents told her they hadn't voted in two decades.

Corn recently closed her accounting office so that her employees could help staff election sites. Calloway also says people are eager to help in the election campaign. A week after the storm, a man came into the GOP office to ask about volunteering. “I’ll have to do it around my wife’s funeral,” the teary-eyed man said. “My country needs me.”

As of Friday, nearly 58% of registered voters in the county had cast their vote. Turnout this year is 19% higher than in 2020. “Many of the voters we’re seeing are on the inactive voter rolls,” says Calloway. “Only 7% of our voters are Election Day voters, so there is no danger of Election Day votes being cannibalized,” he said.

By Friday morning, 3.7 million North Carolinians had voted, surpassing the 2020 early voting total. Later, the State Board of Elections reported over 4 million votes cast in 2024, with over half of registered voters participating.

“This year, voting is a symbolic act for me,” declared Anna Hitrova. A onetime Democrat who now publicly identifies as a conservative activist, she says she has “given up” on the current government. “I am going to vote, I am going to vote for Trump, and I am going to do it on the first day of early voting in the progressive city of Asheville.”

Several federal agencies have used an executive order signed by President Joe Biden to mobilize demographics who typically favor the Democratic Party ahead of election day, spending taxpayer dollars in the process.

Biden signed Executive Order 14019 in March 2021, directing all federal agencies to evaluate ways in which they can promote voter registration and voter participation. Since then, a number of federal agencies have used Biden’s order to direct federal funds toward boosting turnout among groups that have historically opposed Republicans including Native Americans, college students, newly naturalized immigrants and federal employees. Additionally, multiple agencies have partnered with left-of-center activist groups to implement their voter mobilization plans.

“Federal resources should not be used to help any political party or its candidates in the election arena,” Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky wrote in August. “That is an abuse of our governmental structure that is reminiscent of third-world dictatorships. The states should act to stop what amounts to unlawful, partisan interference by executive branch agencies in the administration of elections and the voting and registration process.” (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

In his executive order, Biden specifically emphasized that the administration would work to increase “voter outreach, education, registration and turnout” among Native American voters. Fifty-six percent of Native Americans said they planned to vote for Democratic candidates, compared to just 40% who supported Republicans, according to a poll conducted shortly before the 2022 midterm elections. Democratic political committees have poured considerable funds into turning out Native voters and some have attributed Biden’s 2020 victory in Arizona to Natives.

Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Deb Haaland, for instance, used Biden’s executive order to establish voter registration centers at two Native American universities and then went on to write an essay about it urging Natives to vote, documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation via Freedom of Information (FOIA) request show.

“Your voice and your vote can make a difference,” Haaland’s essay reads. “There are places in this country where Native votes can turn the tables and drive our country toward progress.”

Strong turnout among Native Americans in Arizona contributed to Biden’s victory in the state during the 2020 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.

Other agencies, like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL), have also pushed to increase Native turnout in order to comply with Biden’s order.

HHS, through its Indian Health Service program serving about 2.8 million American Indians, has designated multiple of its facilities in Arizona and New Mexico as voter registration agencies, according to a press release. DOL, meanwhile, has authorized its partners serving Native American communities to engage in voter registration efforts.

College students are another demographic that both the Democratic Party and the federal government are intent on turning out ahead of Tuesday’s election. Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by 38 points among college students, according to an Inside Higher Ed/Generation Lab poll released in October.

In February, the Department of Education (ED) announced that the federal work study program, which provides federal funds to fund employment for low-income students, would be expanded to include work for voter registration organizations. One such job posting at Pennsylvania State University with the League of Women Voters, a pro-abortion organization that typically supports Democrats, called for students to “support the registration and education of community voters” while engaging in “anti-racism practices.”

The website for federal college student aid also directs visitors to voter registration resources, an inclusion the agency notes was made in accordance with Executive Order 14019.

Federal employees, another constituency that strongly supports the Democratic Party, are also set to be major beneficiaries of Executive Order 14019. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced in March 2022 that, to comply with Biden’s executive order, federal workers would be entitled to paid time off to vote in elections.

Federal employees have donated $4.2 million this election cycle, with 84% of their presidential donations going to Harris, Government Executive reported. Not all federal employees are located in the nation’s capital, with many living in Maryland and Virginia, as well as near field offices in other states.

To develop voter mobilization plans, federal agencies collaborated with multiple left-of-center organizations. Among them was Demos, a group that has received millions from the Soros family’s philanthropic network and is aligned with the Democratic Party.

DOL, USDA and DOI all discussed voter mobilization plans with Demos, according to documents obtained via FOIA request by the Heritage Foundation. Demos opposed policies pushed by Trump during his first term, the then-president of the organization testified against the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and the group has worked to build support for the Democratic Party’s agenda, according to Influence Watch.

Additional agencies that launched voter mobilization campaigns targeting left-leaning demographics included the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeking to boost turnout among newly naturalized immigrants, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) publishing voter information material in languages other than English and HHS monitoring whether its voter mobilization campaigns were targeting racial minorities while working to register low-income people on Obamacare.

EEOC told the Daily Caller News Foundation that its work has been “in compliance with the [executive order].”

Not all the voter mobilization efforts advanced by the Biden administration target pro-Democratic demographics. The Department of Transportation (DOT), for instance, worked to analyze traffic patterns to figure out how to make getting to polling locations easier and encouraged local transit agencies to be proactive about managing work zones to ensure easy access to voting centers.

Some of the Biden administration’s voter mobilization efforts even targeted traditionally conservative voting demographics, like the Small Business Administration‘s (SBA) effort to turn out small business owners and the Department of Veterans Affairs‘ (VA) work to get veterans to the polls.

Conservatives, however, have raised concerns about these initiatives as well.

The America First Policy Institute, for instance, demanded information about the SBA’s voter registration activities in Michigan in July after noticing that the distribution of federal resources for the campaign could benefit Democrats.

“There is evidence to suggest that the SBA’s largest presence is in the Michigan counties with the highest concentrations of registered Democrat voters, while at the same time it is least active in the Michigan counties with the highest concentrations of small businesses and registered Republican voters per capita,” AFPI executive director for litigation Mike Berry previously told the DCNF.

The VA, meanwhile, adopted an equity action plan in June 2023 in which it stressed its focus on increasing outreach to minority, LGBT and Native American veterans — all groups that tend to favor the Democratic Party.

“What they have done is weaponize all federal agencies on behalf of President Biden’s reelection campaign,” Republican Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil, chair of the House Administration Committee, said in May of Biden’s voter registration executive order. “As we see the actions taken by this administration to leverage taxpayer dollars for political purposes, that should be concerning to all citizens.”

OPM, HHS, USDA, DOL, SBA, ED, VA, DOT and DHS did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

For weeks, pundits, analysts, pollsters and politicians have been scrutinizing every piece of data coming out of early voting and last minute polls.

There’s more data to parse than possible — amid the craziness, here are five key developments that could indicate who is likely to win the White House:

1. Early Returns In Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania, for obvious reason, has been identified by both campaigns as the state most likely to put them over 270 electoral votes.

In June, FiveThirtyEight published its election model, which determined Pennsylvania to be the most likely “tipping point.”

GOP pollster Frank Luntz told Fox News Monday that if former President Donald Trump can win either Pennsylvania or Michigan, he will win the election.

“We do not project either candidate reaching 270 electoral votes without winning Pennsylvania, which is currently a dead tie,” Decision Desk HQ recently reported. Various polls have the two candidates locked in a dead heat.

This election cycle, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has outsourced a majority of its get-out-the-vote operation to grassroots groups who are barnstorming Pennsylvania to target low-propensity voters, like hunters and gun owners. (RELATED: Conservatives Reveal Plan To Awaken Sleeping Giant Voter Demographic That Could Decide White House, Senate)

“80,000 votes [in Pennsylvania] decided 2020, so let’s break that down. There are 90,000 Amish in Pennsylvania. That is the election. So we are courting the Amish vote, and we’re going to farmers markets, and we’re going to their villages, their towns. We’re meeting them where they are,” Scott Presler, the founder of Early Vote Action, previously told the Daily Caller.

“There are 80,000 truckers in Pennsylvania … a lot of them don’t vote because they’re driving rigs on election day. So we’re trying to get them the mail-in ballot. We’re trying to get them to vote early, because if they’re driving how are they going to vote? That 80,000 number could very well win Pennsylvania,” he continued.

Meanwhile, the Harris campaign told reporters this weekend it’s knocked on 807,000 doors in the Keystone State.

Pennsylvania News ➡️ In 2020, democrats had an advantage of more than 1.1 million mail-in ballots ➡️ Today, in 2024, democrats only have an advantage of 400,000. -700,000 Yes, this is good for Trump. Return your outstanding mail-in ballots & vote on Tuesday. Trump 2024 — ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) November 2, 2024

2. How Close Is Virginia?

Virginia is most likely Harris’s for the taking, but her margin could be telling.

“I believe Trump needs to come within 7 points in VA to win the White House. Anything below 6 and he’s very likely to win, and if it’s somehow below 5 then he is winning decisively,” Christian Heines, political analyst, election modeler and co-host of “Making the Argument” podcast, told the Caller.

In 2020, President Joe Biden won Virginia by ten points. A year later, the White House was stunned as Republican Glenn Youngkin pulled off an upset and won the governor’s seat. On Friday, the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College published one last poll, showing the vice president ahead of Trump in the state by ten points, 51% to 41%.

Talk of Virginia being in play was more prominent when Biden was still the Democratic nominee, but the GOP re-run the Youngkin playbook in hopes of making the state competitive. (RELATED: Team Trump Turns To The Youngkin Playbook To Try And Flip Virginia Red)

“5,000+ GOTV volunteers will be augmented by 500 election attorneys at polling locations across Virginia,” Rich Anderson, the Virginia GOP Chair, previously told the Caller.

Virginia could be an early indicator as its one of only two competitive states, along with Georgia, with polls closing at 7 p.m. Eastern time.

“The 7th District is one of the most hotly contested in the country, and if Trump is winning it it’s because of strong rural turnout in the western end of the district around Culpeper where I live, combined with him making gains with Hispanic and Black voters in Prince William County. If he’s winning there, he’s in great shape in Georgia and PA. Even if he loses the 7th but keeps it close it’s likely a sign he’s more favorable than not to win,” Heines told the Caller.

3. Muslims In Michigan

The uncommitted vote dampened a Biden primary victory in Michigan and the same voters could spoil a Harris White House bid on Tuesday.

There has been a sizable effort within the swing state to punish the vice president for her Middle East policy, so much so that some campaign officials are reportedly worried the state could crack the “Blue Wall.”.

🧵 President Trump took to Truth Social to voice concerns that Arab-Americans are disaffected with Kamala Harris. The Daily Caller recently did a deep dive on dissatisfaction with Harris in Muslim communities in Michigan that touched on some of the same concerns. pic.twitter.com/QQS0X3zGwt — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 21, 2024

In the primary, 81.1% of Democratic voters chose Biden, but 13.3% — more than 100,000 people — chose the uncommitted option in protest of the president. The protests didn’t stop when Harris became the nominee. The Muslim organization “Abandon Biden” rebranded to “Abandon Harris.” Another Muslim organization, “Drive for 75,” previously told the Caller that they ran mathematical calculations to determine that if 75% of their community turns out in the 2024 election then there is a 99.9% chance Trump wins the state. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)

The organization has been visiting mosques and holding various get-out-the-vote events to push the Muslim community out to the polls. Whether they vote for Trump or the Green Party option, Dr. Jill Stein, the organization told the Caller it is a vote against Harris.

“We’re hoping that, whether Republicans or Democrats, will not take our vote for granted. So if it is [spoiling Harris’s chances], I hope it teaches not only the Democrats but the Republicans that, you go against your voters, you go against people as well. You continue to support a genocide, you’re going to lose,” Democrat Khalid Turaani, co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in Michigan, previously told the Caller.

4. Harris’s Pitch To Suburban Women

A frequent character on the campaign trail with Harris has been former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney. It’s all part of Democrats’ pitch to win over some right-leaning women who feel disillusioned with Trump.

Semafor’s Editor-In-Chief Ben Smith made a prediction Monday morning, claiming that if Harris nudges out Trump in the election, the media will have erred by focusing on young men rather than older women. In the same vein, renowned Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer released a rather controversial poll over the weekend that showed Harris leading Trump with senior women, 63% to 28%. By contrast, the vice president only led senior men by two points.

A positive break for Harris among older white women could play well in the Blue Wall, with a notable whiter electorate than in the sun belt.

5. How Trump fares In Iowa

Selzer’s shocking poll was a major outlier in a field of polls that almost all show a dead heat.

The Trump campaign was quick to denounce the poll, pointing to an Emerson College poll also released over the weekend, which put the former president up by double digits in Iowa.

“The Des Moines Register also claims Harris leads by 20 points among women (56-36). In 2020, President Trump tied Biden 49-49 among women according to CNN exits,” the Trump campaign memo argues.

“Once again, Emerson College’s poll today is more similar to the exits, showing instead a lead for President Trump of 5 points – 52-47,” it continues.

Selzer herself said she was shocked by the data she was presenting.

“I’ve been shocked since Tuesday morning last week,” she said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “So I’ve had the time for this to sink in because no one, including me, would’ve thought that Iowa could go for Kamala Harris.”

The only scenario where either candidate wins a landslide is if the polls are wildly off. It will be evident very quickly after Iowa’s polls close at 9 p.m. whether or not Selzer’s poll was an anomaly or a bellwether, giving some insight into how accurate, or not, the rest of the polling industry is this time around.
Our calendars are full of useless holidays. Just last month, we saw Credit Union Day, Mashed Potato Day and Raw Milk Cheese Appreciation Day. While observances like these are otherwise irrelevant at the national level, there is one day of the year that has long lacked federal “holiday” status: Election Day.

Unlike offhanded observances such as Earth Day, on which life goes on as usual, Election Day ought to be an official federal holiday like Presidents’ Day or Thanksgiving, with all non-essential workers receiving a paid day off to carry out their civic duty. Establishing this yearly event as a federal holiday would increase voter turnout, restore faith in our elections, and, most importantly, boost morale through a shared civic display. (RELATED: 5 Key Bellwethers To Watch On Election Day)

Designating Election Day as a national holiday and giving workers the day off would largely mitigate the need for accommodations like mail-in voting and early voting, allowing policymakers to require in-person voting except in special circumstances. This would also make possible a mass return to paper ballots, eliminating the need for voting machines which have been swamped in scandal since 2020.

Some say mail-in voting is ripe for manipulation; others contend voting machines are prone to hacks and glitches. While it is difficult to quantify how much voting machines or absentee ballots have increased the risk of election-rigging, if at all, it is clear that a significant number of Americans have lost faith in our elections – just as they’ve lost faith in our media, our government and their friends and neighbors.

In a world where most Americans have the day off work and vote in person, on a paper ballot, many common doubts about our election system become moot. Of course, exceptions will apply for essential workers or citizens temporarily living in a different state, but the vast majority of Americans would have to physically go to a polling place on Election Day and vote. Volunteers would then count the paper ballots onsite, significantly reducing doubts about voting machine integrity or ballots lost in the mail.

Prominent right-wingers like Vivek Ramaswamy have actually promoted this plan over the course of the 2024 election, citing election integrity concerns. Yet, making Election Day a federal holiday would go far beyond healing the election-denial wound – it would generate patriotism with a new shared tradition.

Civic virtue is a good thing, and public reminders of it are even better. To appreciate our democracy and commit ourselves to maintaining it, we need a public reminder that tyranny, not democracy, has been the norm throughout human history. The United States is exceptional because we establish power not through strength, but by consensus.

As humans, we need physical reminders to keep us mindful of such abstract truths. That is why we build churches, write great works of literature, and even get tattoos. If the principles we hold dear aren’t manifested in anything, we lose them.

A mass migration of Americans to the polls every year would become a powerful symbol of our democracy’s resilience, a shining example to the world that our grand experiment worked. Moreover, a whole day for voting could inspire people to participate in state and local elections – affairs that have an even greater impact on their daily lives than national elections.

People would look forward to voting. It would become a celebrated ritual in a public life otherwise devoid of shared traditions. One could imagine pre-voting brunches and post-voting barbecues. Families could go to the polls in the morning and spend the rest of the day enjoying their freedom and leisure together. Children would grow up looking forward to participating in their citizenship, just like we look forward to Christmas, Thanksgiving and the first day of summer vacation.

These days, Americans can’t even agree on whether the Fourth of July is a day worth celebrating (spoiler alert, it is). But without a shared culture, we cannot have a nation. It is time to start rebuilding that shared culture with a national day that puts our exceptional founding ideals to work.

Millions of Americans are heading to the polls Tuesday to cast their Election Day ballots, and in battleground Georgia, more than half the state’s active voters have already done so.

The Peach State’s early voting period between Oct. 15 and Nov. 1 saw more than 4 million people vote either early in-person or absentee. That’s 55.5% of their active voting populace, according to Georgia’s Election Data Hub.

Both the Trump and Harris campaigns are pouring enormous resources into the state won by President Biden in 2020 by less than 1%.

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

Here is what we know about who has voted in Georgia already:

More women than men

Female early voters in Georgia have outpaced male voters by double digits – something Vice President Kamala Harris’ allies see as a positive sign for Democrats, given their emphasis on abortion rights in the elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

Former President Trump has also made recent appeals to women voters, promising in several events over the last few days to "protect women" and warning they are "under attack" by illegal immigrants under the current Democratic administration.

In Georgia, 56% of early voters were women, while 43.8% were men.

Black women outpaced Black men

The gap between female and male voters in Georgia widened considerably when focused on Black voters.

Women made up 62.1% of Black voters who voted early in-person or absentee, while Black men trailed behind with 37.8%.

Black voters, women in particular, are still expected to favor Harris and the Democratic Party in broad numbers.

The Trump campaign, however, has worked to make inroads with Black men in key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina, with promises of economic prosperity under Republicans.

GEORGIA DEMS CHAIR REVEALS MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED GOP VOTERS AS HARRIS WORKS TO BUILD BROAD BASE

White voters made up the largest share

A 58% majority of Georgia’s early voters were White, according to Georgia Votes, a data aggregation site partnered with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

That was followed by Black voters with 26.4% of the early vote.

Hispanic and Asian voters combined made up roughly 6% of early voters.

Black or African American Georgians make up roughly a third of the state’s population, according to the most recent census data.

Of the state’s active White voters, 63% have already voted, compared to 49.7% of active Black voters, the Georgia elections site says.

High turnout in rural counties

Counties considered more rural in Georgia have seen more of their active voters cast pre-Election Day ballots than more Democratic-leaning areas around Atlanta.

The 20 counties ranked highest in terms of percentage of total active voter turnout so far were all won by Trump in 2020, despite Biden winning the state overall.

The bluer counties in the Atlanta metropolitan area are still significantly larger than those rural counties where turnout is high – but in a race that came down to less than 12,000 votes in 2020, every ballot cast is critical.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Most voters from Democratic strongholds

In terms of sheer numbers, the most early and absentee voters have been in Atlanta and its densely packed surrounding suburbs.

The top three counties in terms of turnout are Towns, Oconee and Dawson – all were won by Trump in 2020, but together the number of active voters who have cast ballots there already is just over 47,000.

By contrast, the counties of Henry, Cobb and Fulton – the third being home to the city of Atlanta itself – have seen less of their total active voting populations turn out before Election Day, but more than 861,000 ballots cast so far.

Over 830,000 didn’t vote in 2020

One of the biggest questions of the Election Day post-mortem will be how more than 830,000 early voters who did not vote at all in 2020 cast their ballots this time around.

That group makes up roughly 21% of Georgia’s early voters, per Georgia Votes.

Roughly half of those voters are White and about a quarter are Black.

Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones told Fox News Digital last week that he believes those voters are largely Trump supporters who voted in 2016 but did not do so in 2020.

It’s worth noting, however, that the majority of early voters in Georgia also voted early in 2020.
Voters in 10 U.S. states will decide on major ballot initiatives this year that either expand or restrict abortion access for women, a highly polarizing issue but one that some advocacy groups do not believe will affect turnout quite as much as some had expected.

It’s unclear to what extent this could impact Vice President Harris, who has focused heavily on abortion access and reproductive rights in her bid for the presidency.

In the final race to Election Day, some doubt the issue has lasting power to turn out voters to the same degree it did during the 2022 midterm elections, held just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

"I think Democrats are dramatically overestimating the power of abortion," Shawn Carney, president of the pro-life nonprofit group "40 Days for Life," told Fox News in an interview.

‘KAMALA ERA’: DNC LAUNCHES TAYLOR SWIFT-THEMED CAMPAIGN IN PITCH TO YOUNG VOTERS

The nonprofit has a grassroots presence in all 50 states and has canvassed heavily in the 10 states that will vote directly on abortion-related measures this year: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Nevada and South Dakota.

The majority of these ballot measures seek to amend efforts passed in Republican-led states, whose leaders moved to restrict abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision on Roe.

Notable policies will be on the books in Missouri, where voters will have the option to reverse the state's near-total ban, and Arizona, where voters can amend the state constitution to allow abortions through the 24-week mark.

The most populous state deciding on abortion measures is Florida, home to more than 13 million registered voters.

Voters there will decide whether to lift an existing law that bans abortions after six weeks and instead extend it to the point of fetal viability between 23 and 24 weeks.

"I think we have the best chance to win in Florida," Carney said, citing the popularity in the state of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and staunch advocate of pro-life issues.

"We have a great presence in Florida. We have great ‘40 Days’ campaigns throughout that great state."

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS PENNSYLVANIA PROVISIONAL BALLOT RULING, IN A MAJOR LOSS FOR GOP

Harris and other Democrats have worked to highlight the new risks to abortion access women face. But it's not clear what impact this will have on turnout in a presidential election dominated by economic issues and immigration.

Former first lady Michelle Obama dedicated most of her stump speech at a Harris rally last week in Kalamazoo, Mich., to outlining the many ways women could see their reproductive rights diminished further.

"Your niece could be the one miscarrying in her bathtub after the hospital turned her away," Obama told the audience. "Your daughter could be the one terrified to call the doctor if she's bleeding during an unexpected pregnancy."

Importantly, voters in states where abortion is on the ballot will vote on it independently, meaning it is "decoupled" from their presidential vote and votes for down-ballot leaders. This means that some staunch pro-choice supporters could theoretically vote for Trump and Republicans in their states while also voting to support pro-life procedures.

This "decoupling" effort would indeed reflect public opinion that has shifted to support abortion. A Fox News poll conducted this year found that a record-high number of voters now say they support legalizing abortion in some form , including two-thirds who said they supported a nationwide law that would guarantee abortion access for women.

Fifty-nine percent said they believe abortion should be legal in "all or most cases," up from the previous high of 57% in September 2022.

But how much the issue of abortion will drive voter turnout this year – for those who are either for or against the new ballot measure – is unclear.

National polls have seen abortion ranked consistently by voters as the third-most important issue in the 2024 election cycle, behind immigration and far behind the economy.

Just 15% of voters ranked abortion as their No. 1 priority in 2024, according to a recent Fox News poll, compared to immigration, which 17% of voters said they viewed as the No. 1 issue, and the economy, which a strong 40% of voters ranked as their top priority.
Now that Election Day is finally here, there are a few counties that experts are closely watching as their results could indicate who the next president will be.

Known as "bellwether counties," these swing counties have, with some exceptions, consistently sided with the winning candidate for decades.

Matthew Bergbower, a political science professor at Indiana State University, described a bellwether county as a "microcosm of the nation" in terms of political preferences.

Though his county, Vigo County in Indiana, deviated by voting for Donald Trump in 2020, it has chosen the winning candidate in every election since 1952.

‘PAINSTAKING PROCESS’: PA COUNTY GIVES UPDATE ON PROBE OF SUSPICIOUS BATCH OF VOTER FORMS

Clallam County in Washington state stands out as the only county to have voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1980. The people of Clallam County are proud of their history as the "last bellwether county" in America.

This year, the county looks just as divided as ever.

Pam Blakeman, chair of the Clallam County Republicans, told Fox News Digital that she thinks the election "will be close in our County, but I see it swinging towards Trump."

She bases this on good Republican turnout and a ground game that she said "is the most active I have ever seen."

PENNSYLVANIA JUDGE ALLOWS ELON MUSK'S PAC TO CONTINUE $1M A DAY GIVEAWAY

However, Ben Anderstone, a progressive Washington-based political consultant, told Fox News Digital that "a Trump win in Clallam County would be a bit of a surprise at this point."

"This year, it looks likely that Clallam County will be to the nation's left," he said. "In our August primary, Clallam County was very Democratic, about 57% to 43%. Lower-turnout voters in Clallam County are much more Republican, so we expect the presidential election will be a lot tighter. Still, our model suggests Clallam will only tighten to 53%-47% Democratic or so."

Like Clallam County, the presidential election could easily go either direction. Yet with GOP nominee former President Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Harris facing razor-thin margins, three counties – Bucks, Erie and Northampton in Pennsylvania – stand out as particularly important.

Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, is the largest swing state and thus the biggest target for both Trump and Harris. During this election cycle, Trump and Harris have had a significant presence in the state and in these three counties.

On the final day before election day, Trump campaigned in both eastern and western Pennsylvania and Harris devoted the entire day to stops across the state. Vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have similarly been making stops in Pennsylvania throughout the campaign.

"Both campaigns see the path to the White House running through Pennsylvania," said Berwood Yost, the director of the national survey group the Center for Opinion Research. Similarly, he said the path to victory in Pennsylvania runs through Bucks, Erie and Northampton counties.

Bucks is a primarily suburban county just north of Philadelphia. Erie, which is situated in far northwestern Pennsylvania on Lake Erie, is primarily rural and significantly smaller in terms of population. Finally, Northampton in eastern Pennsylvania is suburban and home to Lehigh University, a private research college.

According to Yost, all three mirror many of the key demographics, such as racial composition, educational attainment and population density, that make Pennsylvania so competitive.

President Biden won Pennsylvania by a narrow 1.17 percent margin in 2020. The margins in Bucks (4.37), Erie (1.03) and Northampton (0.72) were similarly close.

Yost said that like the rest of the country, people in these counties are "generally dissatisfied" with the economy and want to see some kind of change, something that is a positive indicator for Trump. However, he said "the closest to the closeness of the race makes it seem that they haven't been able to take advantage of that."

"I think part of the reason the race is so close is that that message has not been consistently articulated by the top of the ticket," he said. "Those distractions have raised some concerns among some voters."

Yost said the race will come down to what independents and traditional Republicans who are not enthusiastic about Trump decide at the ballot box.

"That to me is really going to be the inflection point of this election," he said. "If they're wobbly, and they think it's the economy, that's a plus for Trump. If they go into the voting booth, and they think about something else, that's a negative for the Trump campaign."
Chinese regime media outlets limited their English-language commentary on the American presidential election on Tuesday, choosing instead to describe the choice between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as having limited impact on what Beijing described as a divided, violent, and declining America.

China is a totalitarian communist country in which the Communist Party controls all aspects of both government and the daily lives of citizens. Its state media outlets regularly publish propaganda condemning the concept of elections and republican governance, insisting elections “cannot truly reflect the essence of democracy” without a tyrant overseeing all aspects of the state. State media has disparaged America, in particular, as a “low-quality democracy” bringing “chaos” to the world through elections that feature more than one political party and candidates with authentic policy differences.

In anticipation of Tuesday’s vote, the state-run China Daily newspaper published a political cartoon depicting a donkey and an elephant – the classic mascots of the Democrat and Republican parties, respectively – arguing while floating on lifesavers, while the Statue of Liberty drowns in the background. The message appeared to be that the two parties hate each other more than they love their country.

The newspaper also published a seemingly innocuous video describing how America is preparing for Election Day, but derisively referring to the election as potentially “the most expensive in history” and suggesting a significant chance of violence on Tuesday.

“Tight security measures are on the way in many parts of the United States, with some states calling up the National Guard and parts of Arizona even considering deploying snipers,” the propaganda outlet claimed, concluding that Americans are too “divided” and “too many Americans see their fellow citizens as irredeemable.”

An article claiming to analyze the issues in the American election in the state news agency Xinhua trashed both Republicans and Democrats, suggesting that neither party can address Americans’ top issues.

“Both Democrats and Republicans seem unable or unwilling to pursue substantial healthcare reform,” the article claimed. It again claimed that “violent crime” was a pervasive, nationwide problem. The article also criticized the United States for having open political debates around abortion.

“With the debate over ‘life’ [sic] now being completely partisan, abortion rights have been transformed into a political symbol, further widening the divisions splitting American society,” Xinhua claimed.

China allows the killing of unborn children during all steps of a woman’s pregnancy and has one of the world’s highest abortion rates. The Communist Party actively promoted the killing of unborn children for decades and, as part of its “one-child policy,” forcibly killed the children of women who became pregnant “illegally.” The Chinese government boasts that its policy “prevented” 400 million people from living. The “one-child policy” has led to a dramatic collapse in the nation’s fertility rate that the Communist Party has tried, unsuccessfully, to reverse by expanding the mandate to three children per mother.

Xinhua published another analysis of the election that appeared to be an attempt at comedy, declaring that the election is “like a Thanksgiving dinner where no one agrees on the turkey.”

“Both sides saying the same thing: if the other side wins, America is doomed,” the comic anchors claim, ominously predicting, “the cracks in America are only getting deeper.”

In a more sober reflection on the election, columnist Kang Bing at the state-run China Daily lamented that Americans were now more aware of communist China’s rampant intellectual property theft, espionage, imperialism, and other nefarious activity.

“I feel Americans are becoming less and less confident. Why else are the presidential candidates cursing each other in public using expletives?” Kang asked. “Also, there’s hardly been any improvement in public facilities, and people’s livelihoods and living standards over the past 40 years.”

The writer claimed that, in contrast, China – which is currently engaging in genocide against multiple ethnic minorities and regularly imprisons people of faith, political dissidents, and other citizens deemed inconvenient to the regime – had “grown by leaps and bounds.”

Kang also claimed, despite the extensive coverage of the American election in state media, that government propaganda in China was “largely quiet on the US presidential election.”

“Chinese media are worried about China being accused of interfering in the US presidential election,” he alleged. Kang omitted from his article extensive evidence of the Chinese Communist Party attempting to interfere in American politics, including promoting divisive and violent political narratives. In December 2023, for example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) declassified a report full of evidence that China was using outlets such as the Tiktok social media app to promote “divisive” content, including content undermining trust in American elections. In his 2024 book Blood Money, Breitbart News Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer detailed the extensive ties the Chinese regime keeps with several radical leftist agitator groups that played a significant role in left-wing riots responding to instances of alleged police brutality nationwide. Chinese regime-linked billionaires have also bankrolled radical groups promoting transgender ideology and anti-“capitalist” propaganda.

Nearly two years after launching his campaign to return to the White House, former President Trump's bid to win back his old job is now in the hands of America's voters, as Election Day 2024 has arrived.

Facing off against the Republican presidential nominee is Vice President Kamala Harris, who just three and a half months ago replaced her boss – President Biden – atop the Democrats' national ticket.

With roughly 81 million ballots already cast across the country in early voting, and in-person day-of voting now getting underway, both major party nominees are optimistic about their chances in this historic showdown.

"Momentum is on our side," Harris told supporters at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Monday. "Can you feel it."

And hours later, at a rally in Pittsburgh, the vice president reiterated, "make no mistake, we will win.

Trump, also campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania, told supporters "we've been waiting for this. I've been waiting four years for this."

HARRIS, TRUMP, HOLD ELECTION EVE DUELING RALLIES IN THE BIGGEST OF THE BATTLEGROUNDS

And even though the final national polls and key swing state surveys pointed to a margin-of-error race, the former president has touted that "we have a big lead. We have a big lead."

It was a 3-to-3 split decision in Dixville Notch, the tiny town in New Hampshire's North Country that for six decades has been grabbing plenty of attention by holding its vote at midnight on Election Day.

Trump and Harris held dueling rallies on Election Eve in Pennsylvania, which, with 19 electoral votes at stake, is the biggest prize among the seven key battleground states.

Harris closed out her campaign schedule with a large late night rally in Philadelphia, by the famed "Rocky Steps" outside the city's Art Museum.

Around the same time Harris was in Philadelphia, Trump held his final rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the same spot where he closed out his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.

Pennsylvania and Michigan, along with Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, are the seven swing states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris wins the 2024 election.

Harris, Trump, their running mates and top surrogates, have fanned out across the seven battlegrounds the past couple of months. And the two presidential campaigns and allied super PACs have spent nearly all the $2.3 billion they've shelled out to run ads in the White House race in the battleground states.

The vice president and the former president closed out their campaigns with very divergent messages.

Harris, who for a second straight day avoided mentioning Trump by name, closed with a positive and upbeat message as she painted a unified future for the nation.

Trump painted a negative picture of the country the past four years under the Biden administration, as he railed against Democratic policies and spotlighted the dangers of unchecked immigration.

For Trump, the 2024 campaign has been a grueling two-year marathon. He announced his candidacy at his south Florida Mar-a-Lago club days after the 2022 midterm elections. After a slow start, the former president easily dispatched a field of GOP primary opponents – which last year briefly expanded to over a dozen contenders – and ran the table earlier this year in the Republican presidential primaries.

NOVEMBER SURPRISE: DISMAL JOBS REPORT HANDS TRUMP INSTANT AMMUNITION TO FIRE AT HARRIS

Trump, who was indicted in four different criminal cases, saw his support surge and his fundraising soar in the late spring, after he made history as the first former or current president convicted of felonies.

A month later, Biden suffered a major setback after a disastrous late June debate performance against Trump reignited longstanding questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four grueling years in the White House – and sparked calls from within his own party for him to step down.

Trump's polling advantage over Biden widened, and the former president was further politically boosted after surviving an assassination attempt on his life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in July.

But the race was instantly turned upside down days later, as Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president. Democrats quickly coalesced around Harris, and her fundraising surged as her poll numbers soared.

The Harris honeymoon continued through the late August Democratic National Convention, and into September, when most pundits declared her the winner of the one and only presidential debate between her and Trump.

But as the calendar moved from September into October, Trump appeared to regain his footing, and public opinion surveys indicated the former president gaining momentum.

Veteran Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove called the Harris-Trump showdown a "coin toss."

But longtime Republican consultant Alex Castellanos, taking issue with the polls, pointed to voter registration gains by Republicans.

"I think the pollsters are getting this wrong. We’re all missing something because they’re giving us the same poll over and over again. .. Somebody’s missing something."

And Castellanos, a veteran of numerous presidential campaigns, argued "what I think they’re missing a massive shift in voting registration underneath all of this. Thirty-one states have voter registration by party. Thirty of them in the past four years have seen movement by Republicans."

Longtime Democratic pollster Mark Penn, on Fox News' "Special Report," pointed to an apparent surge in early voting by Republicans – after Trump, long a vocal critic of early voting – in recent days embraced the GOP's longstanding effort to make Republicans more accepting of early voting, and said "the only fact we know is that Republicans have done a lot better in the mail in and early voting that they ever have."

Harris, a California resident, cast her vote by mail ahead of Election Day.

The Trump campaign said that the former president would cast his ballot in-person on Election Day in Palm Beach, Florida, where he resides.

Trump, according to his campaign, also planned to spend Election Day with family, friends, and staff, and also do some phone-based tele rallies to targeted spots.

The former president was set to hold his Election Night headquarters at a convention center in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Harris was expected to spend part of Election Day making her case in radio interviews. And the vice president was scheduled to hold her Election Night headquarters at her alma mater, the historically Black Howard University in Washington, D.C.

During the closing final week of the campaign, Trump – who for four years has made false claims that his 2020 loss was due to a rigged election – appeared to be trying to discredit the 2024 election.

Trump, on Sunday, once again argued without providing proof that the Democrats were trying to cheat.

"They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing," the former president charged on Sunday.
Taylor Swift chose football over Kamala Harris’s pre-Election Day rally in Pennsylvania as the music megastar was spotted entering Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs’ game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night.

Swift was rumored to be with Harris at her rally in Pennsylvania on the night before Election Day, but video of Swift entering the stadium made its way to social media.

Swift was spotted wearing a black Chiefs jacket as she was escorted to her seat.

Many of Swift’s A-list peers who support Harris in this year’s presidential election have made appearances at various rallies, including various performers like Lady Gaga, Christian Aguilera, Usher, Eminem and Beyoncé.

However, despite publicly endorsing Harris, Swift is choosing to watch her tight end star boyfriend compete instead of showing out like the others.

TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT AFTER DEBATE: ‘I’VE MADE MY CHOICE'

With a clear schedule and being from a Philadelphia suburb, many believed the stars aligned for Swift to show up. Instead, it’ll be another prime-time NFL matchup where she’ll root for the Chiefs to remain undefeated on the season.

Swift made her choice of president in September with a social media post after Donald Trump’s and Harris’ presidential debate.

"I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice," she captioned her post. "Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story."

Swift said her belief was Harris "fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them."

Meanwhile, this caused a stir in Chiefs Kingdom as Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes and a friend of Swift, first indicated her support for Trump on Aug. 13 after liking Trump’s Instagram post, which was the "2024 GOP platform."

Also, Mahomes’ mother, Randi, was spotted wearing a "Make America Great Again" at the Chiefs game Monday night.

The 2024 presidential election cycle has been among the most heated in recent memory with supporters of both candidates making their voices known.

The Republican nominee, former President Trump, put it succinctly in a recent interview: "This is more exciting than any football game," he said of Election Day on the "Let’s Go!" podcast with Jim Gray and Bill Belichick.

Both Trump and the Democrat nominee, Vice President Harris, have made their impact well known across the United States. The political discourse has seeped into the sports realm over the last few months as well.

Read below for some of the major sports figures who have made endorsements this election season.

LeBron James

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James endorsed Harris for president and posted a video on his X account making misleading comparisons between Trump and Nazism and the KKK.

"I wanted to make sure it was seen, heard, and heard with force," James said of his decision to share the video after his return to Cleveland on Wednesday.

"Having a daughter, having a wife, having a mother and things of that nature, what [Harris] believes in when it comes to women’s rights, that’s what the future with my kids and where I see our country should be. I feel like that endorsement is only right. I mean, come on, you guys know me. It damn sure wasn’t going the other way."

Stephen Curry

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry was awestruck when he met Harris as part of the USA men’s basketball team before they went to Paris for the Olympics this past summer. He later endorsed Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August.

"I believe Kamala as president will bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward," Curry said.

Steve Kerr

Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has largely been an anti-Donald Trump critic. He also appeared at the DNC to endorse Harris.

"I’ll be getting out every day to help people get out to vote on Nov. 5 and elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as the next president and vice president of the United States," Kerr told the crowd.

"After the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump, ‘Night, night!’"

Gregg Popovich

San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich railed against Trump in a near 15-minute rant at the end of October when he was asked about the presidential election.

"He’s a pathetic individual. He’s a small man who has to make everybody around him smaller so he thinks he’s going to be bigger," Popovich said. "And isn’t that the same thing we tell all of our kids in grade school? That’s not how you act. That’s not what you do."

After declaring that Harris won their only debate and railing against some of Trump’s biggest supporters, including Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., he offered a warning.

"Now, the danger follows the delusion, and our kids and grandkids are going to have to live with what this guy puts out there," he said.

"I’m just hoping people who are already sold on him for whatever reason, I can’t figure it out. … The ones that stay home and don’t vote are the ones that worry me because we need everybody to vote. I hope that they won't stay home, that they'll understand that this guy is a scam artist. He's great at it. I'll give him credit for that. He's the best ever, but he makes you want to puke."

Popovich also said he couldn’t wrap his head around why young college-aged kids were in support of Trump.

"What does he say or do that they want to vote for him? They must think he’s a strong guy," he added. "This is the biggest whiner that ever walked the face of the Earth. He's like the poorest example of a fifth-grade bully I've ever seen. I mean, would you want your kids to act like he does?"

Harrison Butker

Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker came out in support of Trump and Hawley in October.

"I’m supporting the president that’s going to be the most pro-life president, and I think Donald Trump is the most pro-life president," Butker said on "The Ingraham Angle."

"That's a topic that is the most crucial topic for me. I want us to be fighting for the most vulnerable, fighting for the unborn, and that’s what we should prioritize."

Danica Patrick

Former NASCAR and IndyCar star Danica Patrick expressed her support for Trump in the election. She revealed on "Jesse Watters Primetime" that she cast a vote in a presidential election for the first time this year.

"It feels like voting for Donald Trump is like the vote of reason. It’s like the rational, reasonable choice," Patrick said.

Patrick said she attended America Fest in Phoenix late last year and that it reinforced her love for the country.

"There were so many great speakers, and I posted some pictures afterwards," she said about attending the event. "Of course, it was very red, white and blue. Red is also my favorite color, and I basically just said I love this country. AMFEST, America Fest, I love this country, seems like the place to be. It just drew so much media attention."

Megan Rapinoe

Megan Rapinoe made her focus clear during the election cycle. She wanted protection for transgender people. She then took a swipe at what she believes would happen with another Trump presidency.

"I also think we have a really amazing opportunity to elect a Black woman in this country. And for me that is really important," Rapinoe said.

"It is stressful. I am nervous, but I also am hopeful. I believe in people, and I certainly believe in women, and I believe that people want better than the grim, dark, just violent reality that Donald Trump has very clearly laid out for us. He’s telling everybody what he’s going to do, and it’s really dark, and it’s really sad, and I don’t think anybody wants to live like that."

Brett Favre

Pro Football Hall of Famer Brett Favre has voiced support for Trump in the past. But he took it to the next level when he stumped for Trump at a campaign rally in Wisconsin.

"Much like the Packers organization, Donald Trump and his organization is a winner," Favre said. "The United States of America won with his leadership."

Thomas Hearns

Boxing Hall of Famer Thomas Hearns was invited to the stage during a Trump rally in Detroit. Trump praised Hearns and said he was one of the best fighters he’s ever seen.

"Hearing those nice words coming from you, man, this can't be real. … Hearing it come from you, I'm very excited. I want to fight now," he said.

Lawrence Taylor & Ottis Anderson

Lawrence Taylor and Ottis Anderson were among the New York Giants greats who appeared at Trump’s Wildwood, New Jersey, rally in May. At the time, attendees were hopeful Trump could turn New Jersey red. But since then, Joe Biden dropped out of the race for re-election and Harris entered the picture.

"I grew up a Democrat, and I've always been a Democrat until I met this man right here," Taylor said to cheers. "Nobody in my family ever will vote for a Democrat again."

Jake Paul

Boxer Jake Paul gave his official endorsement of Trump in a video at the end of October. He called the divisiveness in the selection, which is why he wanted to speak out.

"Don’t judge people off of a character that the media has portrayed them to be because Democrats control 90% of the U.S. media, so they will paint a picture to you all, and that picture is what they want you to see," he said.

Nick Bosa

San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa flashed a Make America Great Again hat after the team’s recent win over the Dallas Cowboys, causing a major uproar in the sports world.

Bosa didn’t explain why he chose to support Trump.

"I’m not going to talk too much about it, but I think it’s an important time," Bosa said after the game.

Patrick Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes may have been the most famous athlete to speak on a political topic but not make an endorsement. His wife, Brittany Mahomes, seemingly backed Trump’s policy platform for 2025 and beyond.

But for Mahomes, he wasn’t going to endorse a candidate either way.

"I don’t want to pressure anyone to vote for a certain president," he told Time. "I want people to use their voice, whoever they believe in. I want them to do the research."

Antonio Brown & Le’Veon Bell

Former Pittsburgh Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell came out in support of Trump in the weeks before Election Day. The two stumped for Trump as the former president held a rally in Pennsylvania.

Dana White

UFC President Dana White was at the Republican National Convention and Trump’s recent rally at Madison Square Garden. He touted Trump having his back during the early days of UFC.

He also made clear Harris represented the "status quo" for a country in need of change.

"She can get your party’s nomination without even facing voters," White said. "What else? What else can she offer the American people other than vague promises and no plan?

"She talks a lot about the need for change and her hope for the future, hope and change. Does that sound familiar? She can use the old Obama playbook, but she’s not Obama, and she is no agent of change. She is the sitting vice president of the United States right now. What she hopes is voters will focus on the future because she doesn’t want us looking at the last four years to see what we really need to change."

White said Americans need change from "sky-high inflation" and "wide-open borders." He also criticized the Biden-Harris administration for "weakness" abroad.

Hulk Hogan

WWE legend Hulk Hogan, like White, spoke at both the Republican National Convention and Trump’s rally in New York. He criticized Harris on key issues.

"All of a sudden, she flips, she flops, she spins and turns around and acts like she was going to be the damn hero," said Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea. "But we all know Trump is the only man that can fix this country today, and with Trump as our commander in chief, peace through strength will fix all of our problems in the Middle East."

Mick Foley

Mick Foley broke from his pro wrestling colleague and sounded the alarm on Trump for what he says would be a disaster for the U.S.

He said he grew up on Long Island and saw Trump as a "harmless conman." However, since his presidency and bids for re-election, Foley said Trump "is not harmless anymore" and is a "very dangerous conman."

"I’ve always liked Kamala Harris. I go back to when she was campaigning for president five years ago. I like what she had to say. I believe she’s a positive, a very competent person. I want to embrace the joy that she brings, the optimism, and not the fear that has been Donald Trump's hallmark.

"I also want to point out that the reason why I spoke out … because I don’t particularly want people to dislike me, and I know when you speak up against someone very powerful with a very strong and very loyal following, you’re going to get some negative blowback. But I also realized I did not want to wake up on the day after the election to find out a swing state had been lost by a couple hundred votes and to know that I could’ve made the difference."

Reese Burkhardt

Texas Tech kicker Reese Burkhardt captured the attention of the college football world when he flashed a supportive Trump message after scoring a touchdown on a trick play.

However, Red Raiders head coach Joey Maguire didn’t appear to be too thrilled with the message at the time.

"We have addressed it. We will continue to address it. We're addressing internally," he said, per the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. "You know, it's always one of [the] things as far as whenever you're dealing with young adults, the really young adults, I guess, the choices that we make and when we make them and when you share it.

"I always think the greatest thing about football, basketball, sports like that, it's a team sport. You always want to make sure that you're putting your team in the best situation. And there's places that you express your opinion and, you know, I don't think necessarily that's a time or the place."

UFC fighters

Several UFC fighters came out in support of Trump. They stumped for him in Michigan while speaking to the Arab-American community.

Justin Gaethje, Henry Cejudo, Beneil Dariush, Frankie Edgar and Rashad Evans were reportedly among those backing the former president.

James Winchester

After the Chiefs' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, long snapper James Winchester was seen wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
Former President Donald Trump selected Grand Rapids, Michigan, for one last rally on Monday to conclude his 2024 presidential campaign.

Grand Rapids is a historic location for Trump. It is where he finished both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns, rallying supporters late into the evening.

November 4, 2024, was no exception. Trump arrived in Grand Rapids late in the evening with supporters packed into an arena and patiently waiting for his final appearance.

Trump delivered his classic entrance with a red tie, navy blue suit, and Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” proudly standing tall for his supporters to get a glimpse of him. “USA, USA, USA,” the crowd chanted.

“It’s unbelievable. Think of it, this is it. This is the last one that we’re going to have to do,” Trump began speaking. “And doing four of these in one day, is a little difficult, but not really because the love, and every one of them has been incredible, just like this. It makes it a lot easier.”

“And I want to say a very special hello to Grand Rapids. It’s been a special place! Remember 2016 and we were given a three percent chance?” he asked.

“You know what? This will be the single greatest victory, politically speaking, in the history of our country,” Trump said.

https://twitter.com/MaryMargOlohan/status/1853793916237045857

“We’re leading going in, by hundreds of thousands of votes, but just pretend we’re tied or losing by a little bit because we want to put on a display tomorrow of unity,” he continued.

“I’d like to begin by asking a question, are you better off now than you were four years ago?” he asked.

“No!” the crowd replied.

“Because over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal, and humiliation after another. Kamala has delivered soaring prices and true economic anguish at home, war and chaos abroad, and a nation-destroying invasion on our southern border, invasion of some of the greatest criminals in the world that are pouring into our country. And we’re not going to take that. We’re going to end that like immediately.”

“My message to you and to all Americans tonight is very simple: We do not have to live this way. We don’t have to live this way,” Trump said.

“Look, the ball’s in our hand. All we have to do is get out the vote tomorrow. You get out the vote. They can’t do anything about it. We win,” he added.

The Wolverine State could play an important role in Trump’s effort to complete the greatest political comeback in modern American history. It is a Rustbelt swing state with 15 Electoral College votes.

If Trump wins either Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, he will likely complete the comeback, many political experts believe, assuming Trump performs as expected elsewhere in the Sunbelt.

Trump is running within the margin of error against Vice President Kamala Harris, state polling shows. Trump won the state in 2016 by 0.3 percentage points. He lost it in 2020 by 2.8 percentage points.

Trump’s rally in Grand Rapids was the last of four rallies on Election Day eve. He began the day in North Carolina and then held two rallies in Pennsylvania.

Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters at his final rally of the 2024 presidential election in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Monday, November 4, the eve of the election.
Former President Donald Trump concluded the final campaign rally of the 2024 election at 2:09 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Election Day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, defying opponents who claimed he was losing his energy.

As he did in 2016, Trump concluded his presidential campaign in Grand Rapids, beginning his remarks before a packed crowd shortly after midnight and speaking for the better part of two hours.

“Can you imagine a crowd like this at, like, one o’clock or some ridiculous time in the morning, on a Monday-slash-Tuesday?” he asked the cheering crowd. “What a compliment,” he said, gratefully, before comparing his rally to his opponent’s allegedly smaller one.

The town is the boyhood home of Gerald Ford, the very definition of an “establishment” Republican. But Ford, like Trump, had been reluctant to see the U.S. enter into foreign military adventures.

And more importantly, for voting purposes, Grand Rapids is in the heart of western Michigan, a region where Trump must turn out the vote if he is to compensate for Vice President Kamala Harris’s efforts to turn out the Democratic vote in Detroit and urban areas.

As he did in the campaign’s “official” closing rally earlier in the evening in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump brought his children onto the stage with him.

Eric Trump exulted, emotion trembling in his voice: “When other candidates have packed it in for the night, you know who is standing on the stage at two a.m.? It’s Donald Trump! … I promise you I will be on the stage ’til the end of earth with you … You are going to save democracy in the United States, and you are going to keep peace in the world, and I love you, and we’re proud of you and let’s make America great again!”

Trump returned home to Mar-a-Lago in Florida well after 5:00 a.m., a sign of his strenuous effort in a campaign in which Democrats tried to claim, without evidence, that he was “exhausted” and showing signs of mental and physical strain.

In 2016, Trump won Michigan en route to winning the presidency. After another late-night Grand Rapids rally, ending several hours into Election Day, with voting already having begun in New Hampshire, he and his supporters hope for a repeat of that near-miraculous finish.

Former President Donald Trump laid out his closing campaign message on Monday at a rally in Pittsburgh: Vice President Kamala Harris broke it, I will fix it.

The rally is Trump’s second stop of the day in the Keystone State. Before attending the event in Pittsburgh, he was in Reading. He plans to hold his last rally of the 2024 campaign cycle in Grand Rapids, Michigan, late Monday night.

“Kamala broke it, I will fix it,” Trump told supporters.

“Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal, and humiliation after another,” Trump will say, according to prepared remarks provided by a senior Trump campaign aide to Breitbart News:

Kamala Harris has delivered soaring prices and economic anguish at home, war and chaos abroad, and a nation-destroying invasion on our southern border. There has never been anything like it in world history. My message to Americans tonight is simple: we do not have to live this way. We do not have to settle for weakness, incompetence, decline, and decay. With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces—and lead America, and indeed the world, to new heights of glory. When we win the election, only one day from now, I will end inflation, I will stop the invasion of criminals coming across our border, I will strengthen our military, I will restore peace in the world, and I will rescue the American dream.

Trump lost the Keystone State in 2020 by 1.2 percentage points. Since then, Republican groups have focused on grassroots initiatives, such as registering voters and encouraging them to vote early.

The Harris campaign believes the Keystone State’s election results won’t be determined until Wednesday or beyond.

The forecast suggests the Harris campaign believes she will not win the election in a landslide, a prediction that some Republicans believe is mostly correct, with the caveat that Trump could win in a landslide. Trump, some argue, has more paths to victory than Harris.

President Donald Trump is backing up his promise to enforce the nation’s border laws with a threat to impose huge tariffs if Mexico does not cooperate.

“I’m going to inform [Mexico’s president] on day one or sooner that if they don’t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I’m going to immediately impose a 25 percent tariff on everything they send into the United States of America,” Trump declared at his Raleigh, N.C. rally on Monday

He added: “If that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 50, and if that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 75. Then I’ll make it 100.”

Mexico’s government is keeping a huge population of migrants in southern Mexico because it is trying to suppress the border chaos that would help Trump win the 2024 election.

“There are hundreds of thousands down there,” said Todd Bensman, a researcher with the Center for Immigration Studies who recently visited cities in southern Mexico:

The default position for Mexico’s national interest is let them flow through [to the U.S. border]: “We don’t want to get stuck with them!” … and they only move off of that [pro-migrant] position when the Americans do or say something that forces them.

In June 2019, Trump successfully used the threat of tariffs to strong-arm Mexico into accepting migration curbs. The curbs included the Migrant Protection Protocols which deterred many migrants by denying them the ability to get the U.S jobs they needed to fund their travel to the United States.

Mexico agreed to the 2019 curbs because Mexico’s economy is dependent on agricultural and manufacturing exports to the United States, and because many Mexicans dislike the chaotic migration trade that feeds the cartels and funds elite corruption in their homeland.

On Monday. establishment outlets in the United States were distressed by Trump’s promise to use tariffs to shield ordinary Americans from migration and drugs. For example, the Washington Post wrote on Monday:

A trade war with Mexico alone could significantly raise prices for American consumers, economists say. The United States imported $476 billion from Mexico last year, more than any other country, according to Kim Clausing, who served in the Biden administration’s Treasury Department … The investment bank UBS has projected the stock market could contract by more than 10 percent from Trump’s tariff plans, while the Peterson Institute has projected they could cost the typical household more than $2,600 per year.

Trump’s 2019 threat was also denounced by U.S. business interests, Democrats, and some of Trump’s economic deputies.

Trump’s 2019 policy was so successful that Democrats quickly killed it once President Joe Biden put a pro-migration progressive, Alejandro Mayrokas, in charge of border security.

Since then Mayorkas has used a variety of rules and loopholes to extract at least 5 million migrants from their poor home countries. That huge illegal inflow has been in addition to the normal airport inflow of legal immigrants and foreign contract workers.

That migration policy is also an economic policy that has provided Biden’s deputies with at least 10 million additional legal and illegal migrants to expand the labor force, suppress wages, inflate real-estate prices, and boost retail profits.

But Mayorkas’ migration policy requires extensive negotiations because Mexico’s government has the power to helpfully hide or chaotically supercharge the flow of migrants across the border.

Mayorkas’s need for Mexico’s cooperation on migrants left Biden with no leverage on other issues, such as Mexico’s decision to roll back its intermittent and very bloody fights with the drug cartels. The cartels’ drug smuggling kills roughly 100,000 Americans per year.

The need for migrant cooperation also left Mayorkas and Biden with little clout when Mexico’s dominant political party passed a law to suppress the power of the nation’s judges in 2024.

But if Trump is elected, Mexico’s government will want to be rid of the growing population of migrants it is storing in southern Mexico, Bensman said.

“It’s painful and uncomfortable and an irritant, it’s like a kidney stone that they are just dying to pass,” Bensman said.

If Trump is elected, the Mexican government, he warned, may quietly release its population of migrants in many small groups, via caravans, bus convoys, and railways before the January inauguration. The tactic is called “Ant Operations,” he said.

“They have their ways of releasing them without appearing to release them,” he told Breitbart News.

Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is willing to let more migrants travel to the U.S. border, Bensman said. But, he added, she “is a pragmatist who would do what she needed if the national interest … was subject to a higher priority, like avoiding [Trump’s] trade tariffs.”
Fewer than one in ten voters made up their minds in the last week before Election Day, according to an exit poll of the 2024 presidential election conducted for CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC on Tuesday.

In contrast, eight in ten voters said that they had made up their minds before September — the traditional start of the presidential campaign season.

CNN reported:

Eight in 10 voters say they made their decision about the presidential race sometime before September. Fewer than 1 in 10 say they decided in the past week, with about one-eighth saying they decided in September or October. Similar majorities of those backing Vice President Kamala Harris and those supporting former President Donald Trump – about 80% – say they decided before September. The results tend to deflate speculation about the effect of late-breaking controversies in the campaign, so-called “October surprises” — such as a joke about Puerto Rico by a comedian at a rally for former President Donald Trump, or President Joe Biden’s claim that Trump supporters are “garbage.”

Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign was said to be counting on “late deciders,” which could also bode ill for her campaign, given that there are so few of them.

However, results in some battleground states could be so close that even a few late deciders could make a difference.

If you are one of the millions of Americans watching the 2024 election and thinking something feels different this time around, you are correct.

Former President Donald Trump is fighting to make a once-in-a-century comeback. Not since President Grover Cleveland in 1893 has a presidential candidate lost reelection only to run again four years later and win. Republicans feel optimistic about the early voting results in states Trump lost in 2020, including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, giving him multiple paths to the coveted 270 Electoral College votes.

Still, the biggest change in this election seems to be the vibe shift. In 2016, it was unheard of for prominent figures with large platforms to publicly support Trump. This sentiment was even worse in 2020 when racial tensions and COVID hysteria polarized the nation. Not only was it career-ending to admit you supported Trump, but it severed families and ended friendships. Naturally, these prominent figures stayed out of the fray, hoping it would spare them.

This is no longer the case. Trump has garnered support from people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk, Megyn Kelly, Joe Rogan, David Sacks and celebrities from the NFL and entertainment world. These people aren’t couch-sitting. They have so much to lose but are willing to risk their livelihoods, reputations and freedom to back Trump’s comeback.

Their reasons vary. In Kelly’s speech at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania, she spoke about protecting American girls and women from harmful transgender ideology. Kelly told women to think about the forgotten men of America whom the Biden/Harris economic policies have decimated when they head into the voting booth. In her moving speech, she mentioned the names of Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray, whom were allegedly killed by illegal immigrants let into America as a direct result of the Democrats’ illegal immigration policy.

Musk, who arguably has the most to lose as the largest recipient of federal funding with his SpaceX program, spoke to Rogan on Monday about his fears that another four years of the Democrats’ illegal immigration policies would change our country forever. He warned that the massive amounts of illegal immigrants being sent to swing states will forever turn our country into a California-style monolith with one-party rule. Musk denounced the legal attacks against SpaceX by the Biden/Harris administration’s Department of Justice and claimed his personal freedom was at risk should Vice President Kamala Harris win.

After the Musk episode went live, Rogan endorsed Trump’s presidential campaign, saying he agreed wholeheartedly with Musk’s assessment of the gravity of this election for the country.

The great and powerful @elonmusk.

If it wasn’t for him we’d be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.

For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.

Kennedy dropped his presidential campaign in August and immediately endorsed Trump. He and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, want to end lobbyist control over the FDA and CDC to “Make America Healthy Again.” Both have actively campaigned for Trump in swing states on this message, and Shanahan even went as far as voting for Trump on stage in Arizona.

Trump isn’t alone in the arena anymore. He isn’t one man fighting for his supporters, but the leader of a broad coalition of blue-collar workers, banking and Silicon Valley elites, mothers and fathers worried about their children’s futures and health and legal immigrants who want the border closed. Win or lose, the movement Trump started in 2015 has grown beyond traditional Republicans and won’t die anytime soon. (Democrats Working Overtime To Turn Election Conspiracies Into Reality)

At the end of this election, it’s important to remember that we are Americans. We’ve fought for freedom since our inception. We’ve faced overwhelming odds to tame a vast wilderness, beat back tyranny and form the greatest nation the world has ever seen. Americans, when united, cannot fail, no matter the enemy.
Tesla founder Elon Musk warned Monday that a President Kamala Harris would use the levers of power to shut down X.

Musk, who famously acquired the platform for billions of dollars to protect free speech, spoke to podcaster Joe Rogan about its future after the election.

"If you didn't do it, no one would have," Rogan said. "And here's the hilarious narrative that I keep hearing from idiots. ‘Elon's a bad businessman. Twitter is worth, you know, 400% less than when he bought it.’ No, it wasn't worth that in the first place. It wasn't worth $44 billion, you f---ing morons. Wrong. And also, you're not taking into account the advertiser boycott. That's total bulls---."

ELON MUSK'S MOTHER REACTS TO MARK CUBAN'S SMEAR ON PRO-TRUMP WOMEN: ‘CERTAINLY NOT US’

Musk agreed and said the Orwellian-named Center for Countering Digital Hate was a "total scam organization" like the Ministry of Truth. He referred to the group as a "censorship organization" that "pushed the advertisers to boycott."

Last year, Musk's X Corp. sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate alleging it had published "misleading claims" and exaggerated the prevalence of harmful content on X to thwart investment from advertisers.

While Musk said that some aspects of the boycott have lessened, this election will be a decisive moment in the battle between government censorship and freedom of speech.

"I think if Trump wins, we'll see, you know, probably most of the boycott will lift," he said. "But if Kamala wins, we'll see that boycott gets stronger and they’ll friggin’ shut [it] down. There's no way that a Kamala puppet regime would allow X to exist."

MAYE MUSK TELLS WOMEN VOTERS TO ‘THINK FOR YOURSELF’ AND STRIVE FOR A BETTER FUTURE

"You really think that they'll be able to shut it down, though? Is there a pathway to that?" the podcast host asked, later inquiring, "What would they do?"

Musk offered a few scenarios he believes could happen.

"They can sic the DOJ [Department of Justice] on you know, and say like, you know, they've got this whole thing about like hate speech, misinformation or whatever, except that they're the ones pushing the misinformation. But that doesn't stop them from filing massive, you know, lawsuits and using the DOJ," he said.

Last year, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against SpaceX , accusing Musk's company of discriminating against asylum recipients and refugees in its hiring decisions. A federal judge put that lawsuit on hold pending the results of SpaceX's own suit.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.

Shortly after the Musk interview was released, Rogan announced his endorsement of Trump on X, saying, "The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn't for him we'd be f---ked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way. For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast."
Sen. JD Vance, former President Trump's 2024 running mate, referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as "trash" during a speech on the eve of Election Day.

"The citizens of this country are not garbage for wanting to be able to afford groceries and a nice place to live. But in two days we are gonna take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash's name is Kamala Harris," Vance declared.

In a post on X, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., opined, "Not too sure that Republicans going from calling Puerto Ricans garbage to calling a woman garbage is the whiz-bang political chess move they think it is."

PRO-TRUMP COMEDIAN WHO TOLD PUERTO RICO JOKE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DRAWS CRITICISM FROM AOC, OTHERS

Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe faced criticism after cracking a joke in which he referred to Puerto Rico as "a floating island of garbage." He made the joke while speaking at Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden.

President Biden later sparked controversy when he said, "The only garbage I see floatin' out there is his supporters."

Biden has suggested that he was characterizing Hinchcliffe's comments as garbage.

BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ DURING HARRIS CAMPAIGN EVENT AS VP PROMISES UNITY AT ELLIPSE RALLY

"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it," Biden said in a post on X. "His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation."

Harris said that Biden had "clarified his comments," and that she opposes "any criticism of people based on who they vote for."

Vance has served in the Senate since 2023.
Harris campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon expects election results in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada will be delayed until Wednesday or beyond.

The forecast suggests the Harris campaign believes she will not win the election in a landslide, a prediction that some Republicans believe is mostly correct, with the caveat that Trump could win in a landslide. Trump, some argue, has more paths to victory than Harris.

Dillon told reporters she expects near-complete results in Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan by the end of Tuesday night.

“We may not know the results of this election for several days, but we are very focused on staying calm and confident throughout this period as the process goes through,” Dillon said. “We believe this race is going to be incredibly close.”

The Trump campaign has indicated it feels confident about its position in the sunbelt states, such as Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina.

If Trump wins all the sunbelt states, Harris must basically hold all the three swing states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada to win. In this scenario, perhaps the one most expected, if Trump wins just one of these states, he wins the election.

“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole ball of wax itself,” Trump told supporters Monday in Reading, Pennsylvania. “We have to turn out and vote tomorrow.”

Many political experts believe whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the election. Harris, however, could win Pennsylvania and lose the election, journalist Mark Halperin said on his 2Way platform. “My reporting is that she’s [Harris] in trouble in Wisconsin.”

“This is based on three sources, two Republicans, one Democrat, all of whom know the state quite well, and all of whom told me today the same version of they would be somewhere between surprised and shocked if Kamala Harris won Wisconsin,” Halperin said.

“The focus has been on Pennsylvania,” Halperin continued. “[Harris] may well win Pennsylvania and win the election, but she could win Pennsylvania and lose the election because she doesn’t win Wisconsin. Watch Wisconsin.”

Trump is scheduled to hold four rallies on Monday: Before flying to Reading, his first was in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump will also rally in Pittsburgh (6:00 p.m.), before his last rally of the 2024 cycle in Grand Rapids, Michigan (10:30 p.m.).

Journalist Mark Halperin said on Monday that the turnout of women would decide the presidential election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump leads Harris by 0.1% in a head-to-head matchup, according to the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to Nov. 3, with Trump’s lead increasing to 0.3% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys. Halperin said that he believed the swing states would be carried by one candidate, and not split, saying the percentage of the voters that were women would be decisive.

WATCH:



“The kind of conventional wisdom amongst Democrats is – and they’re buoyed by this poll – is, she’s closing strong, Trump isn’t and that undecideds, David Plouffe argued last week, are breaking her way,” Halperin said.

“I think right now, people ask me all the time what’s going to happen, I think right now and I continue to believe, and have for a while, that it’s not going to be close,” Halperin continued. “Either the makeup of the electorate is going to be 54 or 55 percent female and she’s going to win, or it’s not and she’s going to lose. And I could be wrong, but I don’t think it’s going to be different state to state.”

Trump holds a 21-point lead among men, 57% to 36%, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of Michigan voters released Sunday, while Harris leads Trump among women by a 17-point margin, 56% to 39%. Across all the battleground states, Trump has a 15-point lead among men, while Harris is ahead by 17% among women, according to the poll.

Trump leads in the RealClearPolling averages for five of the seven swing states, with Harris holding small leads in Wisconsin and Michigan. Trump outperformed polls in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, according to RealClearPolling.

Hillary Clinton lead Trump by 6.5% in the final average before losing Wisconsin to Trump by 0.7%, while Biden led Trump by 6.7% before eking out a 0.7% win in 2020. In Michigan, Biden led Trump by 5.1% but only won by 2.8% in 2020, while Hillary Clinton led Trump by 3.6% in 2016, only to lose the state by 0.3% when the votes were counted.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced last week that they found the likely remains of 25-year-old Minelys Rodriguez-Ramirez of Cornelia. The man suspected of kidnapping and murdering the Puerto Rican native is an illegal alien, Angel DeJesus Rivera-Sanchez.

Keen to spare other families from similar heartbreak, Rodriguez-Ramirez's mother endorsed President Donald Trump at his Sunday rally in Macon, Georgia, emphasizing that it's high time to end this trend of illegally imported barbarism.

Rodriguez-Ramirez, the mother of a 9-year-old girl who had a popular TikTok account where she shared fitness routines, was engaged to be married. Julio Tovor, the victim's fiancé, told Now Hambersham, "Minelys talked about her daughter a lot. She treasured her daughter."

According to Tovor, his fiancée went to Walmart to exchange a photo with an acquaintance. Her car was later found pulled over on the side of Hazel Creek Road.

The victim's family reported her missing on Oct. 23, and six days later the GBI announced that her likely remains were found near the Walmart where she was last seen.

Rivera-Sanchez, 24, was arrested last week and charged with both kidnapping and murdering Rodriguez-Ramirez. Georgia state Sen. John Albers (R) indicated that the suspect was apprehended in Atlanta "as he tried to flee back to Mexico."

Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell confirmed to the Northeast Georgian that Rivera-Sanchez is an illegal alien and accused the Biden-Harris Department of Homeland Security of staying tight-lipped on the matter due to the election.

'I will not let them spill one more drop of precious American blood.'

"[Rodriguez-Ramirez] moved from Puerto Rico and secured employment with Mt. Vernon Hills, Inc. and tirelessly supported her daughter, mother and fiance. She did everything right, yet her life was cut short because of our federal government's repeated failure to protect its own citizens," Albers said in a statement. "Once again, our open-border policies have claimed another innocent life on American soil, right here in Georgia."

Albers asked, "How many more lives must be lost due to the open-border policies in Washington, D.C.?"

The victim's mother, Carmen Ramirez, took the stage at Trump's rally Sunday, holding a flag that read, "Don't blame us[.] We voted for Trump. The Milholen-Ramirez Fam."

After hugging the president, Ramirez introduced herself as the murdered woman's mother, indicating, "She was murdered last Tuesday. I lose my daughter, but I don't lose my faith."

"I know Donald Trump is the best choice for the U.S.A.," continued the bereaved mother. "He is the only one we need to save our country."

"I have a 25-year-old daughter with a lot of life, and somebody stopped her life. And we have to stop with this and keep going with Donald Trump," added Ramirez.

After Ramirez implored Trump to "make America great again," Trump discussed Democrats' border policies then played a video endorsement from another mother who lost her daughter allegedly as a result of illegal aliens.

Following a video endorsement from Alexis Nungaray, who underscored that her 12-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, would not have been allegedly raped and murdered by two illegal Venezuelan nationals had border czar Kamala Harris secured the border, Trump told Georgians Sunday, "The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins."

"When you vote on Tuesday, remember this: Kamala is importing illegal alien rapists and murderers; draconian monsters who are killing our children, our brothers, our sisters, our parents, our friends. They're willing to kill anyone," said Trump. "When I win I will not let these animals into our country any longer. I will not let them spill one more drop of precious American blood."

Vice President Kamala Harris is closing her campaign with calls for unity after smearing former President Donald Trump as a “fascist” and a Hitlerian dictator bent on destroying democracy.

The final messaging strategy is typical of a campaign that seeks to inspire voters to turn out for a greater cause. The tact might come across to swing state voters as lip service after an extremely divisive campaign.

Harris, who rallied supporters in Michigan on Sunday, claimed her “campaign has not been about being against something; it is about being for something,” she said, “A fight for a future with freedom and opportunity and dignity for all Americans.”

For the first time, Harris refused to mention Trump, much less describing him as a “petty tyrant,” “unstable,” “obsessed with revenge,” “consumed with grievance” and “out for unchecked power.”

“Let us turn the page and write the next chapter of our history,” Harris said.

The Trump campaign reminded voters that Harris’s closing messaging was “orange man bad.”

“Their entire closing pitch is ‘Donald Trump is bad and the people who vote for him are bad too,’” Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Post. “It’s the most divisive rhetoric and closing argument from any campaign ever.”

Harris will continue on the campaign trail on Monday, the final day before Election Day. She will hold a campaign event in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and a rally in Allentown. In the evening, she will hold events in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Trump, meanwhile, will hold four rallies: Raleigh, North Carolina, at 10:00 a.m.; Reading, Pennsylvania, at 2:00 p.m.; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at 6:00 p.m.; and Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 10:30 p.m.

The 2024 elections are going to come down to “gas, groceries, and grandkids,” retired U.S. Navy SEAL Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily while campaigning with Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) in Wisconsin on Monday.

“People are having difficulty filling up a gas tank and a grocery cart on the same day. And we are deeply concerned about the future for our children and grandchildren. It just wasn’t like this four years ago. It simply wasn’t,” explained Van Orden, a first-term incumbent running a close race against Democrat Rebecca Cooke in Wisconsin’s Third Congressional District.

“So when we focus on what is really important for Americans, it’s taking care of their families; it’s being able to go to sleep at night — not worrying if a Tren de Aragua gang member is going to break into their house, which happened here in Prairie du Chien,” he continued.

Van Orden, whose own grandchildren live in Prairie du Chien, was referring to the 26-year-old migrant tied to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang who was arrested in September for allegedly holding a woman and her daughter in their home against their will and sexually assaulting them repeatedly. Residents of the small town have reported being fearful to let their children play outside after the brutal crime.

Van Orden has previously placed the blame squarely on the Biden-Harris administration for allowing dangerous criminals to pour over the U.S.-Mexico border.

LISTEN:

“We don’t want that anymore. We want to be able to have our children play in our front yards, in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, [which] has less than 6,000 people in it. Americans are sick and tired. We’re going have a very good night tomorrow. President Trump is going to win,” he said.

“I’m sick and tired of the Democrats blowing all these dog whistles, saying that we’re homophobic, and xenophobic, and this-ophobic and that-ophobic. We’re not,” he added. “We want peace and prosperity for every single American. We want every American to rise to the height that their God-given talents and their drive allow them to. Period.”
A Border Patrol report reviewed by Breitbart Texas revealed that migrant arrests at the nation’s borders jumped to more than 58,000. This is the largest month since August, when approximately 60,000 migrants were arrested after illegally crossing the borders into the United States.

During the month of October, Border Patrol agents arrested approximately 58,000 migrants who illegally crossed the Mexican or Canadian borders into the United States. This is up from the nearly 56,000 apprehended in September.

During the last fiscal year, agents averaged nearly 130,000 arrests per month, according to the CBP Nationwide Encounters report.

Of the 58,000 migrants who illegally crossed the borders in October, the last month before the 2024 Presidential Election, nearly 57,000 crossed through the southwest U.S.-Mexican border. During the recently ended FY24, agents averaged nearly 128,000 arrests per month.

The San Diego Sector continues to lead the nation in migrant arrests along the border. In October, San Diego Sector agents arrested just over 14,000 migrants. This is up from the 13,309 arrested in September.

San Diego was followed by the Tucson Sector (just over 11,000), the El Paso Sector (nearly 11,000), and the Del Rio Sector (nearly 9,000).

Border Patrol agents continue to see alarming numbers of “Special Interest Aliens.” These are migrants who come from countries with connections to terrorism.

In an exclusive report by Breitbart Texas, a leaked Department of Homeland Security report revealed that Border Patrol agents arrested 124 Iranian Special Interest Aliens who were included in the October Border Patrol report cited above.

Earlier this month, Breitbart reported that the Biden-Harris administration flew Special Interest Aliens from California to Texas for processing and release into the United States.

Agents also expressed concern to Breitbart regarding the increasing numbers of unaccompanied migrant children being apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border. One agent said “The dam is starting to break.”

Just last week, agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector found four unaccompanied migrant children floating on a raft in the middle of the night in the Rio Grande. Callous cartel-connected human smugglers abandoned the migrant children.
A Department of Homeland Security report reviewed by Breitbart Texas revealed that Border Patrol agents arrested 124 Iranian nationals who illegally crossed the southwest border in the last month before the presidential election. The number represents a more than 150 percent increase in the apprehension of Iranian nationals when compared to one year earlier. According to a source within CBP, the influx of Iranian nationals and other Special Interest Aliens (SIA) across the U.S./Mexico border shows no indication of slowing as the first month of the new fiscal year comes to an end.

As reported by Breitbart Texas, in October 2023, 50 Iranian migrants were apprehended in multiple sectors along the southwest border. The source says the number tripled during October 2024. A report reviewed by Breitbart Texas last year revealed an increase in the apprehension of all Special Interest Aliens, as the Border Patrol had arrested more than 61,000 Special Interest Aliens in the previous 12 months during fiscal year 2023.

The source says the latest influx of Iranian Special Interest Aliens is concerning, considering the known Iranian plots to assassinate former President Donald Trump. According to the source, the vetting of Iranian nationals has not significantly changed despite the plots, and as with most Special Interest Aliens, almost 90 percent are released into the United States to pursue asylum claims.

According to an AP News report, in late September, U.S. intelligence officials briefed former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Iranian threats against the Republican presidential nominee. According to the report, the briefing centered on previously reported threats from the Iranian government and did not involve a new plot.

The former president faced several threats from Iran since the American drone strike in January 2020 that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. The Iranian major general was traveling to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi near the Baghdad International Airport when the Trump administration launched the drone strike. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq.

The source says the increase in Iranian nationals continues to concern officials within the Border Patrol as most will be released to pursue asylum claims and, as reported by Breitbart Texas, will be allowed to board domestic flights anywhere within the United States.

“There is only so long we can hold them if we can’t come up with any tangible evidence that they pose a threat. Most claim to be citizens tired of the Iranian regime,” the source elaborated. “Our fear is that those who pose the most danger are using this group to blend in with and will ultimately harm Americans.”

The FBI considers Iranian nationals to be Special Interest Aliens. According to a 2019 DHS fact sheet, the term “Significant Interest Alien” is defined as follows:

Generally, an SIA is a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism. DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments. This does not mean that all SIAs are “terrorists,” but rather that the travel and behavior of such individuals indicates a possible nexus to nefarious activity (including terrorism) and, at a minimum, provides indicators that necessitate heightened screening and further investigation. The term SIA does not indicate any specific derogatory information about the individual – and DHS has never indicated that the SIA designation means more than that.

While most Americans are focused on the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both major parties are eyeing key Senate and House races to see who will control the legislative branches of government.

There are several competitive down-ballot races in 2024, but these twelve are the most important to watch on Election Day.

The Senate is currently under Democratic control, but polling shows Republicans can take over if they win seats in Montana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. The election prediction model from 538 shows Republicans winning control of the Senate in 916 out of 1,000 election simulations at the time of writing. Republicans only need to pick up three out of the five seats to flip the majority.

There’s now an 84% chance Republicans win back control of the Senate. pic.twitter.com/0lSU4H0btC — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 24, 2024

Montana:

Montana looks to be the most straightforward pick-up for Republicans. Three-term Democrat Montana Sen. Jon Tester is fighting off a formidable opponent, Republican Tim Sheehy. Montana is a deep-red state, and most polls show Sheehy has the advantage of beating Tester. Democrats and their friends in the corporate media have spent considerable time trying to help Tester over the line. Polling shows that Sheehy is leading Tester by 4 points, however, placing his numbers outside the Emerson College polling’s margin of error.

The latest polls show Tim Sheehy leading against incumbent Sen Jon Tester. Republicans can capture control of the US Senate if we win this race. Let’s go Montana!

West Virginia:

Democrat candidate Glenn Elliott, a former two-time Mayor, and Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice are fighting for the state’s open Senate seat. Justice is very popular in the state and is favored to win the seat. The 538 election simulator found Justice with a 99% chance to win. The most recent polling from August shows Justice polling at 62% and Elliot at just 28%.

Pennsylvania:

Pennsylvania will be a harder pick-up for Republicans, and if Democrats lose, it will arguably be the biggest upset. Incumbent Democrat Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican candidate Dave McCormick are battling for the seat. Despite the 538 election simulator showing Casey beating McCormick 71 out of 100 times, his campaign has seemed nervous he’ll be able to win. In recent weeks, Casey has distanced himself from the Biden/Harris administration by running ads agreeing with Trump’s policies on the economy and immigration. After positive October polling, which gave McCormick a slight lead, November polling shows Casey has just a 2-point lead over McCormick heading into Election Day.

Wisconsin:

Recent polling shows that just two points separates incumbent Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican challenger Eric Hovde for Wisconsin’s Senate seat. This race will likely rest on whether Trump can win Wisconsin and bring up down-ballot races like Hovde’s, according to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. (ROOKE: Harris World Should Keep Panicking. She’s Floundering In Only Election Metric That Matters)

“If Trump were to win by several percentage points, that would be a real challenge for Baldwin,” Franklin said. “If it’s a single percentage point difference, like it has been for the last two presidential races, then I think it’s real tricky to know which way the Senate race goes.”

Ohio:

Ohio’s Senate race between Republican candidate Bernie Moreno and Democrat Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is neck and neck, according to new polling. Moreno holds a half-point lead over Brown. Still, 538’s election simulator has Brown beating Moreno 56 out of 100 times. Trump is expected to win Ohio, which could help push Moreno over the edge.

Republicans currently hold a slim majority in the House, with Democrats only needing four seats to take control. The 538 polling simulator gives Republicans the advantage in holding onto power in the House, showing Republicans with a 58% chance to win. While there are several close House races, Democrats’ best chance at taking back the House likely rests in seven close seats in California, New York, Washington (state), Michigan and Alaska.

California:

California is a deep blue state with 12 Republican-held seats, which party incumbents are fighting to keep. Trump’s successes in turning out to vote in red areas of California will be critical for these candidates’ abilities to win reelection. Democrats want to take California’s 22nd, 27th, and 45th Congressional Districts, where the margins between the parties are razor-thin.

Partisan polls show incumbent Republican Rep. Michelle Steel and her challenger, Democrat Derek Tran, within the margin of error to win California’s 45th Congressional District. While Democrats are hopeful Tran will pick up the seat, 538’s election simulator shows Steel with a slight advantage to win the race. (Democrats Working Overtime To Turn Election Conspiracies Into Reality)

For California’s 22nd district, Republican California Rep. David Valadao is fighting off Democrat candidate Rudy Salas. While Valadao could receive help from Trump via a down-ballot pick-me-up, he is not likely to receive any campaign assistance from the former president, whom Valadao voted to impeach. While October polling shows Valadao trailing Salas by two points, 538’s election simulator has Valadao favored to win.

New swing-state California polling!! 🔵 George Whitesides — 44%

🔴 Mike Garcia* — 43% 🔵 Derek Tran — 45%

🔴 Michelle Steel* — 43% 🔵 Rudy Salas — 43%

🔴 David Valadao* — 39% https://t.co/jSyenrL1rH — Anthony Adragna (@AnthonyAdragna) September 24, 2024

Republican incumbent Mike Garcia is up against Democrat George Whitesides for California’s 27th Congressional district. Garcia first won his seat in 2020 after Democrat Rep. Katie Hill resigned. He beat Democrat Christy Smith in the March 2020 special race, in the November 2020 general election and then again in 2022. Garcia no longer faces Smith but rather a political newcomer, Whitesides. September polling from the University of Southern California/California State University Long Beach Center for Urban Politics and Policy/Cal Poly Pomona gives Whitesides a 2-point advantage over Garcia to win.

New York:

The rematch between incumbent Republican New York Rep. Marc Molinaro and Democrat Josh Riley has become the most expensive House race in this election cycle. Spectrum News reported that candidates have spent over $45 million to win the seat. October polling shows Riley with a 4-point lead over Molinaro and 538’s election simulator shows Molinaro losing to Riley 54 out of 100 times.

Trump 47%https://t.co/IUPGwW3fbO — Poll Tracker 📡 (@PollTracker2024) October 22, 2024

Washington:

The rematch for Washington’s 3rd Congressional district between incumbent Democrat Washington Rep. Maria Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent puts Democrats on the back foot. They can’t afford to lose seats in their march to control the House. Still, Kent is the favorite in the race. Democrat-aligned polling has Kent tied with Gluesenkamp Perez, and 538’s election simulator shows Kent with a 55% chance of winning the race. If Republicans are going to pick up seats to expand their majority, Kent’s race against Gluesenkamp Perez looks promising.

Race to watch — Washington state District 3 – where the ballot bomber just attacked. Joe Kent (R) is neck-and-neck in the polls with Congresswoman Perez (D). Right now both polling at 46%. WA D3 is a swing district and Perez won it in an upset in 2022. It was a Republican… https://t.co/WXA73YRtEV — Katie Daviscourt 📸 (@KatieDaviscourt) November 3, 2024

Alaska:

Alaska isn’t a state most people think about when talking about highly contested races, but their campaigns, supporting political committees and other groups have spent $40 million on the race between incumbent Democrat Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Nick Begich. Polling gives Begich a 4-point lead over Peltola, and 538’s election simulator gives him a 60% chance of winning. (ROOKE: Republicans’ Latest Swing State Win Is The Last Thing Democrats Want Right Now)

Neither party holds a large majority in either chamber, giving each a chance at flipping control. Republicans have a clear shot at flipping key Senate races, however, and could not only hold their current House majority but expand it.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he does not believe there is a silent Vice President Kamala Harris voter, but he said it would not surprise him to see “a silent Trump voter” yet again, making the remarks during an interview on Breitbart News Daily a single day before Election Day.

“Is there such thing as the silent Kamala voter?” host Mike Slater asked the senator, who said it is hard to imagine there are Harris voters out there who are not already shouting it from the rooftops.

“If you look at Democrats in the swing states and certainly in blue states who were just overjoyed and believed that they got rid of Joe Biden back in July … I frankly, don’t see any kind of silent Kamala Harris voter out there,” he said, explaining that there is likely a silent Trump voter again.

“It wouldn’t surprise me, though — given the efforts to cancel Donald Trump’s supporters, to silence them on social media, to deface yard signs they put up, intimidate them when they’re out canvassing — that there is, yet again, a silent Trump voter — voters who don’t … answer pollsters and therefore are going to vote for Trump and be happy that they get a chance to bring back the good times of his first administration,” he said.

“I mean, look, we’re going to know by tomorrow night. That’s what happened in the last two presidential elections. And I don’t see any reason to assume that it wouldn’t be the case,” he added.

Host Mike Slater talked about the silent Trump vote of 2016, noting that Harris’s campaign is “trying to make a silent Kamala vote be a thing.”

“And it started, I think, with Michelle Obama’s speech the other day … which was a dark speech. And I call it, and there’s a better name for it, I’m sure, but I call it the battered wife voter. And she’s trying to create this image that, that women are these emotionally abused victims of their husbands’ … Trump tyranny, and they have to secretly support Kamala in the voting booth, as I’m sure you saw the ads that they released the other day to that effect,” Slater said.

Cotton said he does not believe that narrative “for a second.”

“I think it’s totally made up. I think it’s a fiction of the liberal imagination. I’ve seen that ad you’re talking about with two married couples going in to vote, and the women secretly voting for Harris and not for Trump as their husbands told them to. I think it’s kind of an interesting commentary on the state of some liberal Democrats’ marriages in America,” Cotton said.

LISTEN:

“Maybe that’s how they operate. I frankly don’t know. I don’t know many conservatives or Republicans across the country who operate like that. … This marriage doesn’t operate like that,” he continued, noting that the left’s narrative must be “based on their own experiences — I guess they think that husbands in 2024 are still telling their wives how to vote.”

“To me, it’s a kind of projection that reflects perhaps the state of their own marriages,” he added.

Wisconsin voters will have the opportunity on Election Day to ensure that “only” U.S. citizens can vote in Badger State elections — and an army of leftist groups is fighting tooth and nail to see the constitutional amendment ballot question fail.

Wisconsin is among eight states with Citizen-Only Voting Amendments (COVA) on Tuesday’s general election ballot. While COVA advocates sound confident that the referenda will be approved, Wisconsin left-wing activists have come out in full force to try to shut down the drive.

“We’re confident that all eight amendments are going to pass because it’s an issue people get and agree with. But the most difficult is Wisconsin because of well-funded opposition,” Jack Tomczak, vice president for Citizen Outreach for Americans for Citizen Voting, told The Federalist in an interview late last week.

‘Every’ vs. ‘Only’

Wisconsin’s ballot question asks voters the following:

Should…[the Constitution] be amended to provide that only a United States citizen age 18 or older who resides in an election district may vote in an election for national, state, or local office or on a statewide or local referendum?

Wisconsin’s constitution states, “Every U.S. citizen age 18 or older who has resided in an election district or ward for 28 consecutive days before any election where the citizen offers to vote is an eligible elector.”

Just one little word makes a very big difference, proponents of the amendment say. “Only” clearly limits voting in state elections to citizens; “every” leaves open the door for noncitizens to vote. While federal law prohibits foreign nationals from voting in federal elections, there’s nothing that says noncitizens can’t vote in local and state elections where constitutions don’t explicitly ban the expanded franchise. According to Ballotpedia, 43 states do not specifically prohibit noncitizens from voting.

Blue states have exploited the loophole. As The Federalist has reported, noncitizens are allowed to vote in 17 cities in three states and the District of Columbia. Maryland boasts 11 of the cities granting voting rights to foreign nationals, with San Francisco and Oakland and three cities in Vermont doing the same.

Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin all have COVA questions on the ballot. The backing in those states, Tomczak said, is in line with the significant support for citizen-only voting found in national polls.

But Wisconsin liberals have been activated. More than three-dozen leftist groups are lending their names and resources to an effort to defeat the referendum. The League of Women Voters, which long ago abandoned any sense of nonpartisanship to promote a litany of left-wing causes, is leading the opposition campaign in the Badger State, Tomczak said.

The League led the coalition of leftist groups in a press release decrying the citizen-only voting amendment as “an anti-voter amendment.”

It is indeed an anti-noncitizen voter amendment.

Interestingly, when the Republican-led legislature proposed the resolution to take the amendment question to voters, only one Democrat joined Republicans in supporting the measure in its first vote. Resolutions for constitutional amendment referenda must pass in two consecutive sessions of the legislature to make it on the ballot. The second time around, not a single Democrat voted for the resolution.

Why?

“This amendment is just a way for legislators to create a problem that doesn’t exist and use fear as a tactic to further divide us,” the leftist groups opposing the amendment insist.

‘There’s Been a Lot of Misinformation’

But there is a problem. Thousands of foreign nationals are showing up on voter rolls across the country amid the unprecedented millions of illegal immigrants pouring into the country thanks to the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policies. The Wisconsin Elections Commission admits there are “illegal registrants” on Wisconsin voter rolls, but they do not say how many, according to a lawsuit filed last month. The same lawsuit charges that the state Department of Transportation refuses to provide the Elections Commission with critical data tools that would verify whether a registered voter is a noncitizen.

Democrat Gov. Tony Evers would have vetoed the resolutions on the citizen-only voting amendment if he had the power. Such resolutions, however, do not require the governor’s consent. Evers’ spokeswoman told the left-leaning Wisconsin Examiner that the governor doesn’t support bills that “enable politicians to interfere with elections or make it harder for eligible Wisconsinites to cast their ballot.”

Demanding that only U.S. citizens vote in Wisconsin elections won’t make it more difficult for citizens to vote, advocates of the ballot issue say.

“We’ve seen a lot of misinformation,” Tomczak said, noting that left-wing groups and their friends in corporate media have claimed that the COVA issue is being driven by former President Donald Trump’s assertions that the 2020 election was rigged.

“Our amendment does not deal with federal elections,” Tomczak said. “None of the people in this organization has anything to do with the Trump campaign.”

If Evers was remotely serious about preventing noncitizens from voting in state elections, he’d tell his Department of Transportation to do all in its power to help elections officials vet the voter registration database.

But Democrats have shown that they are not interested in such basic election integrity protections. All but a few Democrats in the House voted against a bill that would have required document proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. The Democrat-controlled Senate refused to take up the measure, and President Joe Biden threatened to veto it if it got to his desk. And the Biden-Harris administration has, like Evers, refused to give state elections officials the federal tools they need to verify citizenship.

‘They are Getting it Wrong’

The groups partnering to try to kill the citizen only amendment are engaged in all manner of left-leaning causes. Many, like the League of Women Voters, despise popular voter ID laws that have strengthened election integrity.

“Changing the wording from ‘every’ citizen to ‘only’ citizens is a way for lawmakers to further restrict our freedom to vote as was the result with the Voter ID law,” said Debra Cronmiller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin in the press release.

The coalition of the unwilling includes extreme leftist groups and lawfare activists, such as Voces de la Frontera, Wisconsin Legislative Socialists, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC), ACLU of Wisconsin, Our Wisconsin Revolution, and Law Forward. The latter, “was founded in 2020 by lawyers who have worked for Democratic interests in Wisconsin for many years,” charity and activist tracker InfluenceWatch reports. As The Federalist has reported, the Madison-based firm bills itself as a protector of democracy, committed to “fair, transparent, and representative government; where Wisconsinites can participate in free, fair elections where their vote counts.” But the leftist law group’s record shows a commitment to Democrat Party causes, including its lead role in a phony lawsuit against Wisconsin’s alternate electors for President Donald Trump in 2020.

Corporate media have joined the crusade to attack the COVA movement as Election Day draws closer. Headlines and stories paint a picture of “anti-immigrant” legislation. It’s a false narrative, said Tomczak. The cause is about election integrity and protecting the voting rights of U.S. citizens, he said.

“Reporters don’t understand the nuances of the issue so they write what they know, and they are getting it wrong” Tomczak said.

NBC News was forced to give former President Donald Trump airtime on Sunday after the outlet violated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules by giving Vice President Kamala Harris a spot on Saturday Night Live (SNL).

The roughly 60-second Trump ad came Sunday toward the end of NBC’s broadcast of NASCAR’s Xfinity 500 at Martinsville Speedway.

Trump, donning a “Make America Great Again” hat, highlighted the failed economic policies of the Biden-Harris administration, the recent disastrous jobs report, and warned a “depression” was looming.

“We have to straighten out our country, we have to close our borders, we have to lower our taxes, we have to get rid of inflation,” Trump said as he stood in front of several American flags. “And we’re going to do it. Just remember, Kamala and her friends broke it — I’ll fix it.”

But the seemingly last-minute ad slot provided to Trump doesn’t compare to the blatant election interference NBC News engaged in on Saturday when it provided Harris with a very pro-Kamala 90-second time slot.

SNL opened by making a mockery of Trump and vice presidential hopeful J.D. Vance before Maya Rudolph — playing Harris — began shilling for the Democrat ticket. Nearly six and a half minutes into the obvious Harris ad, Harris herself appears to give words of wisdom to the fake Harris.

“I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent cannot do — you can open doors,” Harris says to Rudolph, before Rudolph begins her glowing endorsement of the real Harris.

“The American people want to stop the chaos –” Rudolph said.

“And end the drama-la –” Harris chimed in.

“With a cool, new stepmom-ala, kick back in our pajama-la’s and watch a rom-com-ala –” Rudolph said.

“Like Legally Blonde-ala,” Harris says. The duo then cracked a joke about voting, with Harris desperately asking if Rudolph is registered to vote in Pennsylvania.

But as CBR Chair of Politics, Censorship, and Free Speech at the University of Austin Michael Shellenberger argued in a post on X, Trump’s Sunday appearance was not “comparable” to Harris’ — which is required under FCC rules.

“The SNL skit was funny and humanizing and created by the best minds in television. The Trump campaign had to cobble something together at the last minute,” Shellenberger said in the post.

“And, as of now, over 9 million people have watched the clip on YouTube. There’s no way that 9 million people will see the Trump message that NBC put on after NASCAR.”

Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said in a thread on X that Harris’ appearance on SNL ran afoul of the FCC’s “Equal Time” rule. The Equal Time rule stipulates that broadcasters give qualified candidates “comparable time and placement” on air.

“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured [Harris’] appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr alleged. “What comparable time and placement can they offer all other qualifying candidates?”

Other qualifying candidates include independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Jill Stein, Carr pointed out.

This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule.



The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.… https://t.co/LliZF0po9t — Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) November 3, 2024

Carr further explained “another complicating factor.”

“Since SNL made a secret 180 only 50 hours or so before election day, their decision runs into the seven-day rule component of the Equal Time statute. The FCC’s seven-day rule affords qualifying candidates one week to request their Equal Time from the broadcast station.”

As Carr explained, the seven-day rule gives each candidate adequate time to prepare for how they will use their allotted time. But SNL, according to Carr, “structured the … candidate appearance (just hours before an election) in a way that denies all other candidates their one week procedural right.”

SNL also gave time to Virginia Democrat senator and failed vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine. But under the Equal Time clause, SNL was also then required to provide Hung Cao, the Republican candidate in Virginia, equal time. In a statement posted to X, Cao said he disagrees with calls to sue NBC for violating the Equal Time clause.

“I was barnstorming 12 towns and cities across Virginia yesterday talking about how we’re going to secure our border & lower prices, while Tim was being a human punch-line in New York City,” Cao said.

The Center for American Rights (CAR) filed a complaint on Monday “demanding that the FCC enforce long-standing federal law by fining NBC for its willful violation of these basic principles of broadcasting.” SNL’s executive producer, Lorne Michaels, previously said neither candidate would appear on the show to avoid violating the Equal Time rule. CAR alleged that the last-minute switch-up proves Michaels knew he was violating the Equal Time rule.

LANCASTER, Penn.— Former President Donald Trump made a joke about reporters and the attempts on his life as he commented on the level of security at his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, rally on Sunday, and in response media outlets worked themselves into hysterics, claiming he wished violence on the press.

Roughly 3,000 people woke before dawn, braved chilly November temperatures, and stood in line for hours to attend the 10 a.m. Trump visit at the Lancaster County Airport; the first of three campaign stops on his Sunday calendar.

Trump’s podium was strangely protected on just three of four sides with thick, bulletproof glass and large gaps between the glass. One side left him totally unprotected.

“I’m just looking here, and I’m watching, and, this has nothing to do with corruption, but has to do with a little bit with intelligence. I have a piece of glass over here, and I don’t have a piece of glass there, and I have this piece of glass here [In front of his face at the front of the podium] but all we have over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news,” he shrugged, “and I don’t mind that so much.”

It got a laugh from the crowd, who clearly got the edgy joke about the same press that has compared him to Hitler and often mischaracterized his words.

His point was that a shooter would have to aim through the risers where media stands since there was not a clear line of vision to him, but his exposed side was to the open airport field, where there was a clear line of vision and no glass protection at all.

He went on about the glass a bit longer, mentioning it would be good to have glass on the exposed side. There are farmhouses in the distance, he said. “See the guy up in the window back there? Has anybody inspected that? It’s okay. It’s okay. But it would be nice to have [glass].”

The press was already typing. Finally, something worth reporting.

Press at Lancaster Trump Rally, Nov. 4, 2024. Image Credit Beth Brelje

“Breaking: Trump Says He Wouldn’t Mind Someone Shooting Through ‘Fake News’ At Rally,” a Forbes headline reads.

“Trump talks shooting at press, ramps up election fraud claims at Pa. rally,” NBC reported.

“Trump misleads about voter fraud, jokes about press being shot at Lancaster Airport rally,” reported LNP, the left leaning local Lancaster newspaper that fired numerous reporters last month.

The Atlantic gave readers, “Donald Trump’s Latest Violent Fantasy: The former president muses about reporters getting shot.”

Instead of playing the victim, the media should be asking why the Secret Service, which has already dropped the ball twice, would leave Trump exposed.

Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, posted a statement about addressing Trump’s comments.

“President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the media constantly talks and jokes about,” Cheung said. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else. It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”

Rep. Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican seeking reelection, took a shot at the propaganda press too.

“The Constitution is clear that the people that lead this country must have the consent of the governed. Do they have your consent?” Perry asked.

The Biden-Harris administration has allowed millions of people to pour into the country and increased the cost of living, he said. “Did you ask them to surrender in Afghanistan?” he asked.

He pointed to the platform of reporters and television cameras.

“We don’t live in North Korea. We don’t live in Russia or Cuba or communist China. We don’t need their propaganda. We know what’s going on in this country. We have had enough of the disrespect. This is our country. We don’t just live here and they tell us what to do,” Perry said. “There’s been one guy, that’s been willing to stand up to them, and all the people disrespecting you and our country. One guy. And for his willingness to stand up, they tried to bankrupt him. They have tried to throw him in jail. And they have tried to kill him.”

“On Tuesday night. I want you watching MSNBC. I want you watching these people back here,” Perry indicated to the press again. “You are going to be invigorated. You are going to be inspired by what you see. Because they are going to be devastated.”

The crowd cheered at the thought.

Harris has a star-studded Monday night rally planned in Philadelphia, including Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, Ricky Martin, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Adam Blackstone, singer Jazmine Sullivan, hip hop band the Roots, DJ Cassidy, and rapper Fat Joe.

Trump will hold his final rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan Monday night at Van Andel Arena.

The Donald Trump campaign published early-voting numbers that showed a massive decrease in both urban and female voters. Both categories tend to vote Democrat.

Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a campaign memo that stated: "Democrats are facing a massive turnout deficit."

"In every single battleground state, we see President Trump and Republicans outperforming elections past in absentee ballots and early votes cast," the memo claimed.

"Democrats are facing a precipitous decline in urban turnout according to their own 'data experts' and we are tracking an uptick in rural turnout."

The Trump campaign published numbers from Tom Bonier from TargetSmart, which the party described as a "Democrat data expert."

The data was a comparison of early-voter turnout in 2024 compared to the 2020 presidential election.

For Arizona, urban early-voter turnout was down over 385,000 while female turnout was down about 170,000. At the same time, rural turnout was up more than 14,000.

Other stark contrasts were shown for Michigan, where 320,000 fewer urban citizens voted early. There were also 200,000 fewer women who voted, as well. Additionally, rural turnout was up 55,000 in Michigan.

Pennsylvania, where many think the election will be decided, saw a decrease in early urban voters by more than 380,000. Meanwhile, a whopping 450,000 fewer women voted early in the swing state.

'There is a whole lot of spinning going on.'

Bonier himself denied the characterization of the data, calling it "not shocking" that the Trump campaign was spinning the numbers in its favor.

"There is a whole lot of spinning going on in this Trump campaign memo that mischaracterizes our data, and I'm pretty sure I know why," he said on X.

However, on its face, the data seems to obviously favor Trump and the Republicans.

In 2020, two out of three urban voters reportedly voted for Joe Biden over Trump, a 33-point advantage according to Pew Research.

However, the number has narrowed since 2018, when it was a 48-point advantage for Democrats. It was 46 points for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

At the same time, Trump took the rural vote by 32 points in 2020, with 65% of the share. He has widened that gap since 2016 when he had just a 25-point advantage over Hillary Clinton among rural voters.

According to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, women favored Biden with their 2020 vote at an average of 56%, while male voters favored Trump at around 52%.



The numbers were generally the same with the gender gap at around 10-11 points in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.



Despite the claim that the Trump campaign has misrepresented the numbers, it stands to reason that, in general, a decrease in turnout for urban and female voters in swing states would at the very least result in fewer overall votes for Democrats than it would Republicans based on historical voting.

Tomorrow, the voters of Pennsylvania will answer Ben Franklin’s famous demand of the American people: “A republic, if you can keep it.”

My organization, Citizens Alliance, launched the “Pennsylvania Chase” initiative to make sure we answer Franklin’s question with a bold “yes.”

We deployed 120 full time ballot chasers on-the-ground in Pennsylvania to knock on 500,000 doors and solve one problem: in 2020, Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes, but 141,000 Republicans requested a mail-in ballot and left it sitting on their kitchen table.

Now, within the final hours of this wild election year, Democrats are down 403,000 mail-in returns compared to four years ago, while Republicans are up by 114,000 returns. This isn’t just a small shift; it’s an historic swing in the Keystone State.

For the first time in years, early voting and mail-in ballot numbers are seeing a real competition between Republicans and Democrats, signaling an opportunity for a strong Trump showing in Pennsylvania. But here’s the critical point: we can’t let these numbers lull us into a false sense of security. To secure victory, we need every last Republican voter to show up on Election Day.

In 2020, Democrats held a massive advantage with mail-in ballots, creating what many called a “Democrat firewall.” Joe Biden won the mail-in vote by an astonishing 1.4 million ballots, giving him a lead that Trump nearly overcame on Election Day with an overwhelming in-person turnout. This year, the gap is dramatically smaller, with Democrats likely holding a lead of only 400,000 to 600,000 when all mail-in votes are counted, including those from independents and other parties. This reduction means that our path to victory is more achievable than ever—if we show up.

Turning out the vote on Election Day is the linchpin of our strategy. In 2020, President Trump won Election Day voting in Pennsylvania by 1.3 million votes, falling just short of the early vote margin Democrats built. But we can’t rely on history alone. The stakes are too high to assume past patterns will hold.

The momentum we’re seeing in early votes is unprecedented, and it shows the impact of targeted grassroots activism. Groups like America First Works, Turning Point Action, and Early Vote Action have joined with us to shift the landscape in Pennsylvania by knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors, registering new GOP voters, and ensuring that their mail-in ballots get returned. The data proves it: this is working. But all of this effort is a prelude to the main event.

We can’t stop now.

The Democrats know they’re working with a narrower margin this year. They’ve been relentless, using every resource and every strategy to drive up their numbers before Election Day. Make no mistake, they are counting on Republicans to underestimate the importance of Election Day turnout. They want us to believe that the work is done and that early vote gains are enough. That’s simply not the case.

This election is bigger than any single candidate; it’s about the future of our country. The issues we’re facing today—rising inflation, a fentanyl crisis, and weaponization of government—are at a boiling point. If we want to steer America back toward prosperity, safety, and freedom, it starts with showing up at the polls.

This isn’t just another election. It’s a decision point for the direction of our republic.

The path to victory is clear, but it’s not guaranteed. Early vote returns are promising, yes, but they are only part of the equation. Republicans must dominate Election Day the same way we did in 2020.

If we match or exceed 2020 turnout, the data tells us we can secure a win in Pennsylvania. But that outcome hinges on every Republican, every Trump supporter, and everyone who wants to end this nightmare showing up to cast their ballot tomorrow.

This is our moment to make history. Don’t sit this one out. The stakes have never been higher, and we need you to be there.

No sleep until November 6.

Media are openly preparing to slander anything former President Donald Trump says about irregularities in the 2024 election with the asinine smear of “election denial.” But if the 2024 election is anything like the 2020 election, Democrat partisans are trying to tilt the scales in their favor.

Demanding that Trump and his supporters renounce all claims that the 2020 election was somehow “rigged” or “stolen” has become a de rigeur “gotcha” tactic for corporate media figures grilling Trump and his supporters.

For example, J.D. Vance’s superlative performance in the vice presidential debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was harshly criticized because of his “damning non-answer” to the “gotcha” question, posed during the debate’s final minutes by Walz: “Did he (Donald Trump) lose the 2020 election?” As Vox put it, it was “The only moment in the debate that really mattered.”

More recently, Vance was badgered by The New York Times’ Lulu Garcia-Navarro in a long-form interview on Oct. 12, when she posed the question five times: “Senator, yes or no. Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” Vance’s refusal to answer the question to the media’s satisfaction has subsequently generated even more consternation, as New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie, for example, recently fretted that “J.D. Vance’s Election Denialism is Deepening.”

Rigged Election

The problem is that Trump may not have lost a free and fair election in 2020. Many believe that he lost a “rigged” election that was manipulated by censorship, lawfare, and voting irregularities to virtually guarantee that he would lose. How would the voters’ will have played out in an unbiased election system, operating according to established election laws?

The problem is analogous to the infamous 1972 Olympic Gold Medal basketball game between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., which is widely believed to have been “stolen” from the U.S. team as a result of “rigged” officiating during the game’s final minute. As a result, the U.S. team refused to concede that they lost the game and refused to accept the silver medal. But the U.S. team did, in fact, “lose” the 1972 Olympic final basketball game as it was actually recorded by history.

Under what many believe to be similar circumstances, Trump and J.D. Vance have been unwilling to concede an election that was conducted under unprecedented stresses during the pandemic, in an atmosphere of all-out lawfare attacks on basic election laws and norms, in which outside interference may have biased the result. History, however, records Joe Biden as the winner.

The question that is difficult to answer is what exactly does a “rigged” election look like? Is it vans full of counterfeit mail-in ballots pulling up behind election offices in the dead of night, or the manipulation of voting machines by shadowy actors working behind the scenes to shift votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden? There have been many such claims, but no solid evidence to prove them.

But there is one glaring, systematic irregularity in the 2020 election that has been well-documented. There is the now infamous Center for Tech and Civic Life (“ZuckBucks”) and the unprecedented role that CTCL played in tipping the election toward Biden.

CTCL’s Role

Beginning in early 2020, a formerly obscure Chicago nonprofit organization, the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), quietly began to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars of Big Tech money into key election offices in order to incentivize them to act in ways that would ensure a Biden victory.

What followed was a privately funded “shadow campaign” for Biden that took place within the formal structure of the election system itself. Through the injection of more than $330 million of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s money, laundered through CTCL, the professional left presided over a targeted, historically unprecedented takeover of government election offices in key areas of swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

It is important to bear in mind that big CTCL money had nothing to do with traditional campaign finance, media buys, lobbying, or other costs that are related to increasingly expensive modern elections.

It had to do with targeting key election offices in the swing states with multimillion-dollar grants that were to be used to promote mass mail-in voting, to support large-scale ballot harvesting efforts, and to launch intensive multi-media outreach campaigns and surgically targeted, get-out-the-vote efforts in areas that were heavy with Democratic voters.

The money went mainly for mail-in voting equipment, ballot dropboxes, increased staffing of election offices with partisan activists, and precision targeted communication by election officials with likely Democratic voters within the largest, most concentrated pool of potential Democratic voters in the entire southern tier of U.S. states.

Closely Fought Georgia as an Example

Georgia was the top recipient of CTCL funding nationwide in 2020. Here is a breakdown of the numbers for CTCL’s election efforts in eight metro Atlanta counties in 2020 (using proprietary data; our primary sources are the U.S. Census, MIT, and CTCL.):

CTCL investment was $45 million in Georgia, $41 million of which went to eight counties (Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Forsyth, Fulton, and Gwinnett) in the Atlanta metro area.

The average size of CTCL grants in the eight Atlanta metro counties was a staggering $4.96 million, which translated into an astonishing average level of per capita CTCL spending in these counties of $8.75 for every person (not registered voter).

The eight CTCL grant counties in the Atlanta metro area contain only 43 percent of Georgia’s population, but received 84 percent of total CTCL spending.

The average rate of increase in Biden votes in these counties compared to 2016 was 43.8 percent, which was more than double the average statewide increase of 20 percent in Biden votes. Such an enormous increase in turnout across a large, diverse population such as the eight Atlanta Metro counties in a single election cycle would be extraordinary under normal circumstances.

The increase in Trump’s votes in these eight greater Atlanta counties was only 15.5 percent, which is about what one would expect given the rate of population growth.

In the eight greater Atlanta counties, approximately 78 percent of this huge increase in turnout on average went to Biden.

All of the Atlanta CTCL counties swung heavily Democratic in 2020, most notably Cobb County (shift D + 15), Gwinnett County (shift D + 12), Clayton County (shift D + 12), Douglas County (shift D +15), and even the heavily Republican northwest Atlanta counties of Cherokee and Forsyth (shift D +12 and shift D + 14, respectively). Georgia’s overall partisan shift was D + 5.1 in 2020. Shifts of this magnitude over one election cycle in a populous, diverse area are highly unlikely unless some outside force is operating.

Biden’s margin over Trump increased by 250,939 votes in these eight counties out of 443,207 additional votes, in a state that Biden won by about 12,000 votes. Adjusting for population growth and an average increase in turnout of 9.1 percent, a basic estimate of the number of additional Biden votes that can be attributed to CTCL involvement in Georgia’s 2020 election is 188,204 votes (75 percent of 250,939). This mostly offset Trump’s Georgia margin over Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of 246,287 votes in 2016, which is what it was designed to do.

A Rigged Election

Trump lost the 2020 election in the CTCL-financed metro Atlanta counties, where his approximately 235,000-vote margin throughout Georgia’s other 151 counties was erased. CTCL’s $41 million investment there enabled partisan Democrat and Never-Trump election officials to conduct the election of their dreams, and their dreams were focused on defeating Trump.

Even The New York Times noted that the astonishing pro-Democrat partisan shift in the Atlanta metro counties “would have stunned [Democrat] party officials not that long ago.”

Would the Atlanta metro area have shifted so hard toward Democrats in the absence of CTCL involvement?

That’s extremely unlikely, especially when one considers the focused, targeted nature of such a novel, gargantuan undertaking. As The New York Times gushed shortly after the election:

Over all, Mr. Biden ran well ahead of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 showing in well-educated, wealthy and increasingly diverse precincts around Atlanta, while making relatively few gains elsewhere in the state. Just a few decades ago, the ring of suburbs surrounding Atlanta would have counted as some of the most reliably Republican parts of the state.

Was the election “free and fair?” Emphatically not. To give some idea, consider that in order to provide the same level of per-capita private funding ($8.75) throughout all of Georgia to enable Republican election officials to also conduct the “election of their dreams,” CTCL would have had to pour an additional $50.3 million into the state. That such an imbalance existed does not seem “fair” by any standard.

A “rigged” election is one which has been manipulated or controlled by deceptive or dishonest means to ensure a specific candidate wins. CTCL’s involvement in Georgia’s 2020 election certainly meets that definition.

At a time when we’re all deluged with conflicting polls and statistical ties, Donald Trump’s campaign is unusually confident.

The Kamala Harris operation also sees reason for optimism, with news that late deciders are breaking her way by more than 10%. But she still casts herself as the underdog. Her "SNL" appearance doesn’t change that; nor does Trump saying that RFK’s plan to remove fluoride from the water, a major public health advance, "sounds okay to me."

Most media folks, either publicly or privately, believe Trump will win, even as the anti-Trumpers beg their followers to turn out for the VP – such as MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace asking her ex-boss George W. Bush to publicly back Harris.

The climax of the campaign seems built around a gaping gender gap–with Kamala doing far better among women and Trump much better among men.

THE ‘GARBAGE’ CAMPAIGN: WHY MISTAKES AND DISTRACTIONS COULD TILT THE OUTCOME

The view from the Trump camp is that registration figures favor Republicans, based on mail-in voting, in the battleground states that will decide the race. Nearly half the country has already voted.

Take the crucial commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 2020, Democrats had a 7.5% advantage, and that’s now shrunk to a 3-point edge.

What’s more, just 39% of Democrats who have voted there so far are men, compared to 49% among Republicans.

Democratic strategist Tom Bonier, who appears on MSNBC, says the Pennsylvania electorate is much more Republican, and much more male, than last time.

Harris needs a huge turnout in Philadelphia to carry the state, and numerous news reports say she’s still struggling to win over some Black men.

In Wisconsin, the view from Trump World is that in-person voting (which tends to favor the former president) is outnumbering mail ballots (which lean Democratic). Trump’s strength is among male, white and rural voters. So, as in the case of Philly, Harris must do very well in Milwaukee and Madison to carry the state.

RACIST TALK AT RALLY MARS TRUMP’S MESSAGE, BUT HE SCORES ON JOE ROGAN PODCAST

Michigan, which Rep. Debbie Dingell recently told me is a toss-up, remains an enigma, because it doesn’t track party registration. So the ballgame there may turn on how well Harris does in Detroit.

The Trump camp sees similar advantages in such swing states as Georgia and North Carolina, where public polling is close but would be a bigger stretch for a Harris win. The election really turns on the three Blue Wall states.

Maybe Harris should have picked Josh Shapiro?

In one key state after another, local Black leaders are quoted on the record as saying they’re worried about warning signs in their community:

Politico: "The city of Milwaukee is trailing the rest of the state by about 7 percent both in its mail-in return rate and in overall registered voter turnout. It’s a warning sign, even some Democrats privately say, for Harris as her campaign looks to run up the score with urban and suburban voters to overcome Wisconsin’s rural counties."

Capital B, Atlanta: The turnout of Black voters in Georgia "has dropped from more than 29 percent" on the first day of early voting "to about 25 percent…That’s the bad news for Harris…

TRUMP IS ‘SURGING’ WHILE KAMALA HARRIS IS ‘COLLAPSING’: CLAY TRAVIS

"Elected leaders and political observers say Democrats looking for a guaranteed win in statewide office races in Georgia usually need to hit a 30 percent Black turnout rate."

Charlotte Observer: "As of Wednesday, Black voters had cast 207,000 fewer ballots compared with four years ago — a drop of almost 40 percent."

"I am worried about turnout in Detroit. I think it’s real," said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide, told ABC.

A sunnier view is offered by this Politico piece, which says that public polls appear to be undercounting Harris’ support.

The story says that "shy Trump voters" – who don’t want to tell pollsters who they’re supporting–are a thing of the past, given the aggressive nature of his campaign.

Instead, many "forgotten" Harris voters are missed by the polls, especially Republicans frustrated with their own party: Nikki Haley voters.

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

Citing a national survey, Politico says 66% of those voting for Haley in the primaries backed Trump in 2016, dropping to 59% four years ago and an estimated 45% this time. "Meanwhile, their support for the Democratic presidential nominee has nearly tripled from only 13 percent supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 to 36 percent indicating an intent to vote for Kamala Harris."

To which I say: Who the hell knows?

We’re at the point now before tomorrow’s election that pollsters are analyzing the polls to figure out which ones are off. And–here comes the cliché – it all depends on turnout. Despite raising a billion bucks, if some of Harris’ potential supporters stay home, that sinks her candidacy.

The scenarios favored by the Trump team rest largely on party registration, not polls that have missed the mark in the last two cycles.

That explains why the former president is more confident, even as he asks his advisers whether they really believe he’s going to win.
Obama 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina said on MSNBC Sunday that the early voting numbers are "scary" for the Harris campaign as data shows Republicans making significant gains with early voting in battleground states compared to 2020.

"The early vote numbers are a little scary," Messina said on "Inside with Jen Psaki" when asked what the Harris campaign's biggest concerns are in the days before an election.

"Republicans didn't do what they did last time," Messina added. "Last time, Trump said don't early vote so they didn't. Republicans do have an advantage in early vote numbers. When the early votes come in, it's going to look a little bit different than 2020 and that's scary."

TRUMP, HARRIS CAMPAIGNS MAKE FINAL PLAYS AS NATION SITS BARELY ONE DAY FROM ELECTION DAY

But Messina said, Democrats are pleased with the early turnout of two key voting blocs - women and young voters, demographics the Harris campaign is banking on.

"Women voters make up 55% of the early voters and in the past 10 days, young voters in these battleground states are coming out in what looks to be, for early votes, historic numbers," he said.

Still, Messina added, the early vote totals have caused lots of "my friends to call me panicking" when comparing the data to 2020.

While early voting has traditionally been favored by Democrats, both parties have pushed voters to cast ballots ahead of time in this election - and the emphasis on early voting has had a seismic effect.

New numbers released in Nevada, a key swing state, show historic early-voting numbers for Republicans, who lead Democrats by about 5% in the early vote which ended in person on Friday. Early voting concluded in the state with 393,811 votes cast for Republicans, 344,539 for Democrats, and 287,762 for other affiliations, according to the secretary of state's website.

MILLIONS OF VOTERS HAVE ALREADY CAST BALLOTS IN FOR NOV. 5 ELECTION

The roughly 49,000 vote advantage that Republicans had over Democrats at the end of the week is a stark contrast from 2020, when Democrats ended early voting with a 43,000-vote advantage.

Some political pundits and politicians outside the Republican Party have also sounded the alarm for Democrats in Nevada in terms of the GOP early-vote surge.

"Republicans are kicking our ass at early voting," Nevada Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus said during a Harris rally in North Las Vegas. "We cannot let that happen."

In Georgia, Republicans appear confident the state’s record-setting early voting numbers will favor Trump. The former commander in chief lost Georgia by less than 1% in 2020, and Republicans have poured enormous time and resources into winning it back.

During the early voting period between Oct. 15 and Nov. 1, nearly 4 million Georgians cast in-person or absentee ballots, more than half the state’s active voters. Over 700,000 people who voted already in 2024 did not vote at all in 2020, according to Georgia Votes . Meanwhile, the top three counties for voter turnout rates are rural areas won by Trump in 2020.

A source on the Trump campaign told the New York Post Sunday that in four battleground states - Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania, "Democrats have more than 1.4 million voters who voted before Election Day in 2020 or 2022 but have not voted yet and many not having even requested a mail ballot," the outlet reported.

The Post cited early voting data from Arizona, reporting that returned mail and early-vote party registration has Republicans currently up by 8 points. Relative to 2020 numbers, Republicans currently lead by 9 points, according to the outlet.

Similarly, in Nevada, the Post shows Republicans up by one point in returned mail and early-vote party registration. Compared to 2020, Republicans are leading by 9 points, the outlet reported.

"This appears to be the first time Republicans have ever clinched the early vote in North Carolina," the Post wrote.

While Democrats are leading in early votes in Pennsylvania, Republicans are reportedly significantly better positioned than they were in 2020, according to the Post.

No matter who wins the 2024 presidential race, it’s clear the liberal media lost. Journalists were fresh off nearly a decade of openly leftist activism and they just got worse. Many legacy news outlets abandoned every vestige of neutral news coverage. And readers noticed.

Americans noticed all the times the supposedly neutral press called Trump "fascist," compared him to Hitler and more. They noticed when wealthy, elite journalists pretended that inflation wasn’t a problem and that people could somehow afford the massive spike in housing and food costs. Oh, and that claiming otherwise made ordinary voters stupid or worse.

Voters saw ABC News host Martha Raddatz act like it didn’t matter when a violent foreign gang took over apartment buildings in Colorado because "the incidents were limited to a handful of apartment complexes." What she meant was a handful of apartments where the poors live and ABC News staffers don’t.

DONALD TRUMP SAYS PRESS HAS LOST ALL CREDIBILITY, BLASTS LIZ CHENEY OVER DISTORTED COMMENTS

The legacy media continue to lose respect. And it’s well-earned. A new Gallup study shows that fewer than a third of Americans hold a "great deal" or "fair amount" of faith in the media to report news properly. Americans have obviously been watching campaign coverage.

We’ve seen repeated examples of journalists pretending anything they disagree with is either "misinformation" or "disinformation," even if it turns out to be true. (The Hunter Biden laptop is only one example of many.)

And when they don't openly lie about the news, they rely on so-called fact-checks to misrepresent it. Like how ABC’s moderators only fact-checked former President Donald Trump during the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Or how they allowed President Joe Biden to repeatedly make false claims about Trump’s comments regarding the Charlottesville protests.

What’s disturbing is all those aren’t the worst examples of the pathetic liberal press this election. Here they are, so you don’t forget:

1. That’s real ‘garbage’

Which one is more important, a comedian making a joke about "garbage" or the president of the United States calling half the country "garbage?" If you’re the news media, you covered the first and covered up the second. And Biden’s comment came as he was stumping for Harris.

The Washington Post tried to muddy the waters and claim what Biden did was unclear. "Did Biden call Trump supporters ‘garbage’? It comes down to an apostrophe." Actually, it doesn’t. If Team Trump tried to doctor White House documents to pretend otherwise, the Post would have gone nuts. But when the current administration did it, nada. Even left-wing AP reported, "AP sources: White House altered record of Biden’s ‘garbage’ remarks despite stenographer concerns."

The comment was so bad that Harris had to distance herself from what Biden said. So, even Harris was more honest than the press. But with early voting already happening, most in the news media are incapable of giving Trump any talking points. Even when they’re true.

2. Biden’s health is still an issue

Biden’s cognitive decline remains an enormous issue the major media don’t dare touch – even though he still has the nuclear codes and is still president. Just like they avoided it prior to the debate. But when Biden embarrassed himself against Trump, the press threw granddad from the train and the ticket.

Yet, journalists haven’t pushed to remove him from office. Because that would put Harris in the job and she would be connected to every stupid and awful thing this administration has done. Instead, they presented her as a change candidate even though she said she would do nothing different.

It’s worth remembering that Biden’s mental fitness was an issue even heading into the last election, so he hid in his basement. After he won, his obvious failings got so bad that White House staffers had one person in an Easter Bunny costume move Biden away from inquiring reporters. And that was in April … 2022.

Back in March, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough went on a classic rant claiming that Biden was at the top of his game. "Start your tape right now, because I'm about to tell you the truth. And f-you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever." He wasn’t even laughed off the network.

One day, when D.C. reporters all write their books about the Biden years, they will all admit their stories of how out of it Biden was. But they refused to report those because they had to stop Orange Man Bad.

3. Endorsements don’t really matter

Readers and journalists don’t care about political endorsements except when it undermines their sense that an outlet is on their team. Both were upset enough that the Los Angeles Times pulled its endorsement of Harris. But, they were ready to throw their Pumpkin Spice Lattes in protest when the Washington Post did it.

The Post is in Democrat Central, or D.C., a place so leftist that Trump has gotten 4-5% there in the national election. Twice. So, when leftist readers and even-more leftist staff were unable to bash Trump one more time, they revolted. (The Post staff is revolting … write your own joke here ____________.)

The rest of the news media threw a tantrum so bad that the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) even suggested the Post owner give the paper away: "Jeff Bezos Should Donate the Washington Post to a Charity." The article called it "a bold, patriotic move" to give away the paper along with perhaps $100 million to cover about one year’s losses. CJR’s hope is that the 250,000 readers who quit over the controversy would return.

What CJR failed to realize is that the Post is already a charity. It lost $77 million in 2023 alone. Even with those readers.

New York Magazine's Intelligencer summarized the news media’s campaign meltdown that led to these and countless other examples of bias. One network exec declared, "It's going to change everything" if Trump wins. That idea is intolerable to newsies. "If half the country has decided that Trump is qualified to be president, that means they're not reading any of this media, and we’ve lost this audience completely. A Trump victory means mainstream media is dead in its current form," the exec concluded.

Yep.

On the eve of Election Day, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is taking center stage as both nominees vie for final votes in the battleground state during a bevy of rallies and campaign stops.

President Biden, who was born in the Keystone State, however, has already wrapped up his campaigning for the Harris ticket and will be absent from his vice president’s list of campaign events in his old backyard.

Harris’ Monday schedule includes campaign events in Scranton, Allentown and Reading, as well as a rally in Pittsburgh before her last speech to Pennsylvania voters during a rally in Philadelphia Monday evening. Along the campaign trail, the VP will be joined at various times by supporters and surrogates, such as second gentleman Doug Emhoff, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and a long list of celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.

Pennsylvania is again a key battleground state this cycle, and is expected to determine the outcome of the overall election. Biden won the Keystone State in his successful 2020 race, after Trump won the state when he squared off against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.

BIDEN CALLS REPUBLICANS THE 'GUYS YOU'D LIKE TO SMACK IN THE A--': 'JUST FEEL THE UNITY'

Biden was born in Scranton and lived there until the age of 10, with the Biden family holding deep roots in the area and state overall.

Biden’s great-grandfather, for example, Edward Francis Blewitt, was a Scranton fixture at the turn of the century. He served as chairman of the St. Patrick’s Day parade in 1897, was elected to the state Senate in 1906 and co-founded the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in Scranton in 1908. Fast-forward about 100 years, his great-grandson's last name is emblazoned on street signs and has become synonymous with the city itself.

BILL MAHER WARNS THAT BIDEN'S 'GARBAGE' COMMENT IS A 'BIGGER GAFFE THAN PEOPLE THINK': 'DEPLORABLES TIMES 10'

Biden, however, is not scheduled to join Harris during her final pitch to Keystone voters – or elsewhere on the campaign trail – after delivering his final Harris stump speech in Scranton on Saturday.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and Harris campaign inquiring about Biden’s absence from his home state in the final stretch of the election, but did not receive replies.

Biden reflected on his love of Pennsylvania and Scranton during his final remarks supporting Harris’ campaign on Saturday, where he spoke to union workers.

"Scranton becomes part of your heart," Biden said. "It crawls into your heart. It’s real. It’s not hyperbole. It’s not a joke. It’s real."

JONATHAN TURLEY: ANGRY RHETORIC IS ALL THE RAGE, BUT HERE'S TO HOPE

The event, however, was underscored by a viral moment about "macho guys" and Biden’s apparent desire to "smack" Republicans.

"There's one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do: they want another giant tax cut for the wealthy. Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guys," he said Saturday.

"But I tell you what, man, when I lived in Scranton, I said, you remember we used to have a little trouble going down to The Plot once in a while? Green Ridge. But I'm serious. These [are] the kind of guys you'd like to smack in the a---," Biden continued.

INDEPENDENTS REACT NEGATIVELY TO BIDEN’S ‘GARBAGE’ COMMENTS IN REAL TIME

The comments were ridiculed on social media, as critics argued Biden was intentionally trying to undermine the Harris campaign, comparing it to when Biden suggested Trump supporters were "garbage" last month.

BIDEN STUMBLES THROUGH EVENT, REFERS TO FORMER REP. GIFFORDS IN PAST TENSE: 'NOTHING WRONG WITH ME'

"Wonder if @flotus ‘pushed’ an otherwise silent @JoeBiden out front in the closing days of the campaign to talk s--- and undermine @TheDemocrats and @KamalaHarris efforts as payback for unceremoniously sacking her man? Nah, it's all probably just a coincidence," CNN commentator David Urban joked .

Meghan McCain agreed : "He’s intentionally trying to hurt Harris and no one can convince me differently at this point."

Biden will leave office on Jan. 20, after initially kicking off the 2024 election cycle fully committed to running for re-election. That plan began crumbling over the summer as concerns mounted over the president’s mental acuity and age following repeated gaffes on the campaign trail and in his official capacity as commander in chief.

Biden’s June presidential debate against Trump officially opened the floodgates to traditional Democratic allies joining a chorus of calls for Biden to drop out of the race and pass the torch to a younger generation.

As Harris crisscrosses the Keystone State, former President Trump has also zeroed-in on Pennsylvania. Trump is holding rallies in both Reading and Pittsburgh on Monday, as well as a rally in North Carolina and another in Michigan Monday evening.

A year ago, many Democrats believed a Trump nomination would depress Republican turnout, energize the Democratic base, and lead to an easy win on Election Day. But Democrats woke up this morning to a very different race, and they have only themselves to question.

10: Who pushed President Joe Biden to do such an early presidential debate?

Were senior Democratic operatives setting Biden up to fail? There was no reason to agree to a debate so early. Were they deliberately trying to create a reason to replace him on the ballot? Or were they legitimately blindsided by his poor performance? Should they have pushed him out sooner? Could they have? Why didn’t he "pass the baton" a year ago?

9: Was it a mistake to take Biden out of the race?

They have to wonder if Biden could have won this race. More importantly, would he have done less damage to their brand? Vice President Kamala Harris has hemorrhaged support from working class and minority voters. Why did Biden really drop out? He wasn’t doing press conferences and media interviews, but neither has she. He wasn’t keeping a heavy schedule. Neither has she. He wasn’t coherent on policy. Neither was Harris. Should Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi have stayed their hand?

8: Did no one see how unprepared Kamala Harris was to be the nominee?

Surely her inability to articulate policy, think on her feet and connect with voters should have been noticed at some point in her political career. Why didn’t Democrats see her shortcomings in basic retail politics? What if Democrats had actually done a mini-primary to select the best candidate? Obviously, only Harris could access the Biden war chest. But would they have been better off with a less well-funded candidate who could actually take on former President Donald Trump? Why did mainstream Democrats just roll over and allow this to happen? What kind of shenanigans went into her installment as the party nominee?

7: What if Harris had chosen Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate?

Democrats have to wonder if the Jewishness of popular Gov. Shapiro would have been a bigger liability than the dishonesty of Minnesota’s self-described "knucklehead" Governor Tim Walz. Should they have been more prepared to vet vice presidential candidates earlier? If they had picked Shapiro, would that assure a Trump victory in Michigan?

6: Why was President Barack Obama the last one to endorse?

Was he expecting a competitive primary? Why wasn’t there one? Did he know how bad Harris would be at campaigning? Why didn’t he speak up?

5: Why didn’t Democrats benefit from the federal response to Hurricane Helene the way Obama benefited from Hurricane Sandy?

The whole foundation of the Democratic Party is that government is the solution. But faced with a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the competence of government, the Biden-Harris administration fell flat. Sure, it was a terrible disaster. But so was Hurricane Sandy – yet Obama’s handling of that disaster was ultimately a game changer in the 2012 race. Trump handled disasters with compassion and competence, even when he wasn’t in office (think East Palestine, Ohio, and Hurricane Helene) What got in the way this time?

4: How did they so badly underestimate Trump’s appeal to their own base of voters?

Democrats have to be asking themselves if they really understand America. Polling shows Dems are losing union voters, minorities and youth in unprecedented numbers. With two former Democratic presidential candidates endorsing Trump, Harris found herself cozying up to Dick and Liz Cheney for endorsements. Nobody else had that on their bingo card for 2024. Did no one consider whether Harris could successfully distance herself from her radical past? Who did they imagine she would appeal to?

3: Should Harris have done more to distinguish herself from Biden?

She couldn’t name one thing she would do differently. Why not? Was Biden so selfish and insecure that he wouldn’t allow her to put any daylight between them? Roughly two-thirds of the country believes the USA is on the "wrong track" and Democrats can’t name anything they would do differently?

2: How wise was it to put a target on Trump’s back with incendiary rhetoric and insufficient Secret Service protection?

Without a doubt, the assassination attempts on Trump helped him politically – as did the lawfare by partisan prosecutors and judges. Did Democrats anticipate how badly their plans might backfire? Did the Democrats really believe demonizing Trump as a fascist Nazi while simultaneously claiming to unite the nation as the party of "joy" was going to resonate with independent voters? It was probably a feel-good moment for the liberal base, but it was not a good closing argument.

1: Do the Bidens secretly want Harris to lose?

Democrats will inevitably claim that is garbage, but "garbage" is the point. Biden calling Trump supporters "garbage" follows a long line of repetitive disdain for millions of Americans. "How could anyone support Trump?" they bemoan in unison. Could Biden have done more to help her win, perhaps by just being silent? At least twice he stole the limelight from her, holding press conferences directly opposite national appearances she made, and the garbage comment could not have come at a worse time for the V.P. running to replace Joe. Perhaps they are resentful of being pushed off the ticket?
Left-wing New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) openly demonized residents of her state who vote Republican, calling them "anti-American" — among other things.

Hochul made her comments during a Saturday appearance on MSNBC to discuss the 2024 election with host Al Sharpton, Mediaite reported.

'Because you have just trashed American values and what our country is all about over and over and over.'

Sharpton asked the governor about House of Representative races in New York — as well as former President Donald Trump's recent New York City rally at Madison Square Garden during which a comedian made a controversial joke about Puerto Rico, the outlet said.

According to Mediaite, Hochul noted that one wouldn't think that leaders of "this great country" would "tolerate" such statements "at one of their rallies." Hochul then said she believes Trump's NYC rally "backfired on him," Mediate added.

The outlet also noted that she said she's "leading the effort in our state to ensure we flip these battleground seats."

Hochul then said the rally controversy helped her paint Republican candidates in her state as closely aligned with Trump — and those who vote for them as "anti-American":

"It gave me a chance to tie the Republicans running in these seats, the incumbents, closer to Donald Trump, and remind everybody, if you’re voting for these Republicans in New York, you are voting for someone who supports Donald Trump — and you’re anti-woman, you’re anti-abortion, and basically you’re anti-American," Hochul said. "Because you have just trashed American values and what our country is all about over and over and over."

You can view video of Hochul's comments here.

Mediate said Sharpton didn't ask Hochul any follow-up questions after her attack on her own constituents.

In response to Hochul's remarks, U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) called Hochul the "worst governor in America." Stefanik devoted a longer post to Hochul's words here.

Speaking of being anti-American

While we're on the subject of anti-American behavior, let us not forget that the FBI in September announced that an agent working for the communist Chinese government infiltrated Hochul's office.

Linda Sun — who worked as deputy chief of staff for Hochul and deputy diversity officer for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo — was accused of money laundering conspiracy, violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and alien smuggling. Sun's husband, Chris Hu, also was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and misuse by means of identification.

Angel Mom Carmen Ramirez, a Puerto Rican native whose 25-year-old daughter Minelys “Mimi” Rodriguez-Ramirez was murdered — allegedly by an illegal alien — in Habersham County, Georgia, is urging Americans to vote for Donald Trump on Tuesday, November 5.

“My name is Carmen Ramirez, I’m the mother of Minelys “Mimi” Rodriguez-Ramirez. She was murdered last Tuesday,” Ramirez told the crowd at a Trump rally in Georgia on Sunday evening.

“I lose my daughter but I don’t lose my faith. And I know Donald Trump is the best choice for the U.S.A. And not the best choice, he’s the only one we need to protect our country,” she said. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News reported, 24-year-old illegal alien Angel DeJesus Rivera-Sanchez of Mexico has been arrested by the Habersham County Sheriff’s Office and charged with kidnapping and murdering Mimi Rodriguez-Ramirez, a Puerto Rican fitness influencer on social media.

Rodriguez-Ramirez went missing on Oct. 22 after she was last seen at a Walmart in Cornelia, Georgia. The next day, she was reported missing. Police, using K-9s, were able to locate Rodriguez-Ramirez’s body, which was found near the Walmart.

Days later, on Oct. 28, police located Rivera-Sanchez near a bus station in Atlanta, Georgia.

“I just want to let you know that everybody has to go out and vote. Because just for talking and don’t vote, we don’t do nothing,” Ramirez told voters at the Trump rally:

Take your friends, take your children who are 18 years old, everybody have to vote because that’s the only way we’re gonna save us country. And I want to let you know that Donald Trump is not a choice, he’s just number one. And Jesus let me come over here today to let you know that I have a 25-years daughter with a lot of life and somebody stopped her life and we have to stop with this and keep going with Donald Trump. [Emphasis added]

Ramirez said that following her daughter’s murder, she met privately with Trump in person and described him as “the most wonderful person that I see, that I know right now.”

“He help us, he be with us all the time … he will always be there for my family, that’s why we’re going to be for him all the time,” Ramirez said. “… don’t forget to go and vote. God bless America. Please make America great again.”

Rodriguez-Ramirez’s family has set up a GoFundMe to raise money for her funeral expenses.

Rivera-Sanchez remains held at the Habersham County Jail without bond. His bond hearing for the kidnapping charge against him is set for November 20.

Former President Donald Trump rallied supporters on Monday in Reading, Pennsylvania, a state that some political experts believe will determine the election’s outcome.

Trump lost the Keystone State in 2020 by 1.2 percentage points. Since then, Republican groups have focused on grassroots initiatives, such as registering voters and encouraging them to vote early.

The Harris campaign believes the Keystone State’s election results won’t be determined until Wednesday or beyond.

“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole ball of wax itself,” Trump said. “We have to turn out and vote tomorrow.”

“We’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting four years for this,” Trump said. “Get off the damn couch. Come on. We gotta make America great again … what we should do is just swamp them tomorrow.”

Trump is scheduled to hold four rallies on Monday: Before flying to Reading, his first was in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump will also rally in Pittsburgh (6:00 p.m.) before his last rally of the 2024 cycle in Grand Rapids, Michigan (10:30 p.m.).

“America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before,” Trump vowed. “This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure.”

“Stand up and tell Kamala, that you’ve had enough, you’re not going to take it anymore,” Trump said.

“I’d like to begin by asking you a very, very easy, simple question, are you better off now than you were four years ago?” he asked. “No!” the crowd replied.

Halperin said on his 2Way platform “My reporting is that she’s [Harris] in trouble in Wisconsin.” Political experts said for months that whichever candidate wins Pennsylvania wins the election, but Harris could win Pennsylvania and lose the election, journalist Mark

“This is based on three sources, two Republicans, one Democrat, all of whom know the state quite well, and all of whom told me today the same version of they would be somewhere between surprised and shocked if Kamala Harris won Wisconsin,” Halperin said. “The focus has been on Pennsylvania,” Halperin continued. “[Harris] may well win Pennsylvania and win the election, but she could win Pennsylvania and lose the election because she doesn’t win Wisconsin. Watch Wisconsin.”

Silicon Valley Billionaire Reid Hoffman, a prominent supporter of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign and past visitor to Epstein Island, has warned that political divisions are straining relationships in Silicon Valley during the heated 2024 election.

Bloomberg reports that Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, Democrat mega-donor, and visitor to Epstein Island, has expressed concerns about the lasting impact of the contentious 2024 presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on the tech industry. In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Hoffman said that the political rancor has cooled some normally warm relationships in Silicon Valley.

“I don’t think it’s just retaliation in business circumstances from folks who are supporting Trump,” Hoffman said, describing the divisions as deep and potentially long-lasting. He noted that certain limited partners, or investors in venture capital firms, were “very supportive of Trump” and had withdrawn support from firms whose partners are backing Harris. Although Greylock was not directly affected by such moves, Hoffman refrained from providing specifics on the investors or firms involved.

Silicon Valley, known for its leftist leanings, has seen a surge in support for Trump in recent months. High-profile figures such as Elon Musk and venture capitalists like 8VC General Partner Joe Lonsdale and Sequoia Capital Partner Shaun Maguire have made significant donations to the Trump campaign. They have also engaged in public disputes with Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and other Harris supporters on the Musk-owned social media platform X (formerly Twitter).

Looking ahead to a potential Harris administration, Hoffman expressed hope that FTC Chair Lina Khan would reconsider policies around mergers and acquisitions to encourage more activity in the tech sector. He also said he hopes SEC Chair Gary Gensler will revise regulations to provide more certainty for emerging industries.

While Hoffman admitted he hasn’t fully considered the implications of a Trump victory, he emphasized the need for businesses to build resilience in what he anticipates could be a chaotic and uncertain period marked by “grifter capitalism.” This, he explained, would involve “sweating various businesses for his own political favor.” Hoffman also expressed hope that if Elon Musk takes a role in a Trump government, the billionaire CEO will treat competing businesses fairly.

“Obviously I’m very hopeful that Vice President Harris will win the election,” Hoffman said. “And so therefore haven’t done enormous contingency planning yet.”

President Joe Biden followed his condemnation of half the country as “garbage” last week by publicly fantasizing about giving men who vote for Republicans a “smack.”

At his final campaign stop for Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday, Biden told Pennsylvania voters he’d like to hit “macho guys.”

“There’s one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do. They want to have a giant tax cut for the wealthy,” Biden said. “Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it’s macho guys.”

“I tell you what, man, when I was in Scranton, we used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while,” Biden added. “These are the kinds of guys you’d like to smack in the -ss,” Biden said.

Trump mocked the lame-duck commander-in-chief at a North Carolina event later Saturday night.

Biden on Republicans: “these are the kind of guys you'd like to smack in the ass."

“I don’t even know, is he still around?” Trump asked a rally crowd, according to the Associated Press.

Trump also taunted the outgoing president last week after Biden called the Republican nominee’s supporters’ “garbage” as Harris delivered her final arguments on the National Mall.

“Donald Trump has no character,” Biden said on a call with Latino activists. The president referenced a comedian who joked that Puerto Rico was an island of garbage at Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden.

“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said.

Trump responded the next day by riding a garbage truck into a Wisconsin rally Wednesday night.

“How do you like my garbage truck?” Trump asked reporters gathered just outside the venue. “This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden.”

Trump continued to deliver his speech while dressed as a garbage man.

“250 million Americans are not garbage,” Trump told his supporters.

The White House press staff went on to fraudulently edit an official transcript of the president’s “garbage” remark in a potential violation of the Presidential Records Act. Staffers “rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading ‘supporter’s’ rather than ‘supporters,'” the AP reported.

The deceptive edit, however, provoked ethical concerns among the official stenographers.

“If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” a White House supervisor reportedly wrote in an email. “Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.”

House Republicans wrote a letter to the White House Wednesday over the transcript edit.

“White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message,” wrote Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Elise Stefanik of New York. “Though President Biden’s relevance continues to diminish, his words continue to matter, even as they become increasingly divisive and erratic.”
The following is based on the opening speech delivered at Donald Trump’s rally in Milwaukee on Friday, November 1, 2024.

Greetings Team America! My name is Sebastian Gorka, and I’m a legal immigrant to the Greatest Nation in the World: America!

And I’m proud to be called “garbage” by Biden, Harris, and the rest of the Democrats.

But what I’m really proud of is working in the White House as Strategist to President Trump, the greatest and bravest leader America has had since the first Republican president, the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.

Why is he the greatest? Here’s a quick reminder for your undecided friends and relatives.

Because when he was the president, American’s could afford to pay for their groceries, pay the mortgage, and fill their car with gas without having to think twice whether they could afford to fill the tank to the top.

When we were in the White House, he unleashed the liquid gold under our feet, the lifeblood of our economy so massively that for the first time we exported the oil and gas we couldn’t use because we had so much of it; and as a result, everything was cheaper for all Americans.

When President Trump was Commander-in-Chief, we were a nation with borders, our military wasn’t infected with Drag Queen recruitment officers, our allies felt safe, and our enemies were afraid of us. Just ask the people of Israel as they fight a war for survival that never would have happened if President Trump were sat behind the Resolute Desk.

And most shocking of all, during the Trump years, beautiful 12-year old girls like Jocelyn Nungaray weren’t being raped by Venezuelan illegals paroled into America by Kamala Harris.

If you vote for four more years of Kamala, the America we love, the republic your children deserve, will no longer exist. And we will likely see the initiation of World War III in the Middle East.

For four years under my former boss, we had no new wars. Russia didn’t invade her neighbors, China wasn’t harassing our ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace, and women and children weren’t being slaughtered in Israel in the greatest loss of Jewish life since the end of World War II.

We simply can’t survive a Kamala Harris White House, a woman who’s proud she was “the last person in the room” when Biden decided to surrender Afghanistan resulting in the murder of 13 of our warfighters and the abandonment of billions in U.S. weapons to the people who harbored Osama bin Laden.

It seems so very long ago. But it wasn’t. Just a scant four years ago Americans were safe. And, moreover, the world was geopolitically stable.

In that time, we have gone from peace to anarchy. How? Because the Harris-Biden regime jettisoned President Donald Trump’s policy of “Surgical Strength,” which is the label I use for his judicious use of America’s overwhelming might only when strategically and geopolitically necessary, a label I have presented to President Trump as the best description of his stance and which he agrees is an apt description.

Surgical Strength worked because it didn’t start with the assertion that American leadership is the problem as is the case with the current administration. Nor was it informed by the interventionist idiocy of the neoconservatives, a la the George W. Bush White House.

What is Surgical Strength? Let us wind the clock back.

First, keeping his campaign pledge, President Trump refused to engage America in any new “stupid wars.” Instead he drew down our overseas military presence and insisted our allies do more to shoulder the burden of their own defense, especially our very wealthy allies in NATO and our even richer partners in Asia.

At the same time, with his understanding gleaned from half a century as a titan of international business, he knew that the interconnectedness of the 21st century world negates the logic of isolationism. As a result, he used force when necessary, and he used it incredibly decisively, like a surgeon.

How did this Surgical Strength actually work, and how did it make us all safe? Let me illustrate with key moments from his presidency.

When we informed the president that the murderous regime of Bassar al Assad was preparing to again use chemical weapons against unarmed civilians, he acted decisively. The president wasn’t interested in invading Syria or effecting some idealistic an improbable “regime change” in Damascus. Instead, he ordered the Pentagon to obliterate the Syrian airbase preparing the chemical weapon attack. And we did, turning it to smoldering rubble with more than 50 cruise missiles. It just so happened that he did this while the dictator of Communist China was eating chocolate cake at a state dinner at Mar-a-Lago, sending a message to all dictators tempted to use such heinous means that we don’t talk about red-lines, we act.

Then there’s Iran and the case of the deadliest terrorist in the world, Major General Qasem Soleimani.

Ostensibly head of the Quds Force branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Soleimani was in fact the second most powerful man in the Islamic theocratic state of Iran, behind only the Ayatollah.

When our intelligence briefers informed President Trump that Major General Soleimani was traveling to Iraq in preparation for a series of terror attacks across the region that would target more than 600 of our troops, the Commander-in-Chief again took decisive action, instantly.

On January 3, 2020, one of our MQ-9 Reaper drones launched its payload soon after the Iranian mass-murderer climbed into his convoy at Baghdad airport. The strike was so surgical and complete, that Soleimani had to be identified by the unique ring he always wore since there was nothing else recognizable left of him.

The policy of Surgical Strength was not reserved solely for malefactors from the Middle East. Anti-status quo actors like Vladimir Putin were also sent a message by President Trump to behave themselves lest they to attract the increased ire of the American president.

And it’s not just about the Middle East. Surgical Strength also works against authoritarian regimes in Eastern Europe. When America is led by those who think America is the problem, bad guys take action. When Obama had his feet up on the Resolute Desk, former KGB colonel Putin took Crimea. When Biden was napping on the beach, Russian invaded her neighbor again. When we were in the White House, Vlad behaved himself. Why? Surgical Strength.

When we informed the president that hundreds of Russian troops disguised at Wagner Group mercenaries were destabilizing the Middle East, President Trump didn’t invade the country they were terrorizing, he wasn’t interested in some fool’s errand of neocon “regime change.” Instead, he ordered the Secretary of Defense to unleash the dogs of war and have the greatest special operations forces in the world kill them all. Five hours later, at the end of the Battle of Khasham, the Russians had been turned into red mist, in a Surgical Strike the likes of which no president has ever authorized, not even the great Ronald Reagan.

The enemies of America were clear that this man loves the nation he leads, and when he speaks of retribution, he means it. How do they know this? Because he has amply demonstrated that when necessary, he will kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, flatten a chemical weapons facility, or drone the most dangerous terrorist in the world with deadly precision.

We were safe once. We can be safe again if President Trump and his approach of Surgical Strength are back in the White House. If we are led by a Commander-in-Chief feared by our enemies and a friend to our friends like Israel.

Kamala broke America and has brought the world to the brink of Armageddon in Europe and the Middle East.

Only President Trump can fix American again. Only President Trump can prevent World War III.

Vote for a president who is truly fearless yet wants no new wars, a man who quite literally took a bullet for you.
On the eve of the November 5, 2024, presidential election it is important to remember that Democrat Kamala Harris is pro-gun control and Republican Donald Trump is pro-Second Amendment.

To put it plainly, there is a vast chasm between Harris’s constant push for more gun control and Trump’s consistent support for the right to keep and bear arms.

For example, Harris is campaigning on the same big three gun controls that she and Joe Biden were unable to secure during their time in office together. Those controls are an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. (Harris’s running mate, Democrat Tim Walz, supports these gun controls as well.)

Gun control is such a central component of the Harris campaign that, as Breitbart News noted, her “New Way Forward” includes ongoing efforts to secure the same old gun controls Biden wanted.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, remains a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

Following the June 12, 2016, terror attack on Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, Trump was asked if he would support an “assault weapons” ban and he responded, “I absolutely wouldn’t because people need protection, they have to protect.”

Trump argued that if there was an assault weapons ban, “the bad guys will have the assault rifles and the people trying to protect themselves will be standing there with a BB gun.”

Fast forward to August 8, 2024, less than a month after the July 13 attempt on his life, and Trump remained constant. In a speech from Mar-a-Lago he pointed out that the assassination attempt against him did not change his conviction that the American “people need guns for protection.”

And we cannot forget, it was Trump who gave us Supreme Court justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, securing a 6-3 SCOTUS majority in support of the Second Amendment.

On the other hand, on October 24, 2024, FOX News reported that Harris “[entertained a] Supreme Court-packing question during a town hall.”

Packing the court would mean Harris could expand it to 12 justices instead of the nine who currently occupy it. Doing this would erase the 6-3 pro-Second Amendment majority, replacing it with a court that is at best 6-6, or at worst 7-5 against the Second Amendment, assuming a current pro-Second Amendment justice retires and she had the opportunity to replace him.

The bottom line: The stakes are high on November 5 and every gun owner, hunter, and freedom-loving American needs to see this election through the lens of four very important words: “Shall Not Be Infringed.” Trump is the candidate determined to honor those words.

Vice President Kamala Harris made a last-minute appeal to Muslim voters in the swing state of Michigan, a group that continues to express anger over the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict in Gaza.

"I want to say this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating," Harris said Sunday at a rally in Michigan. "And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security and self-determination."

The remarks came just over a week after multiple Muslim leaders from Michigan joined former President Trump on stage during a rally in Novi, Michigan, to express their support for him, with Trump boasting that he was "thrilled to accept the endorsement of these highly respected leaders."

TRUMP EARNS ENDORSEMENT FROM 'HIGHLY RESPECTED' MUSLIM LEADERS IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Imam Belal Alzuhairi and Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi were among the group of four Muslim leaders to officially endorse Trump on stage, boasting about the former president’s ability to avoid international conflicts.

"We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war!" Alzuhairi said during his remarks. "The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason."

During her rally Sunday, Harris said she was "joined today by leaders of the Arab American community," though the leaders did not join her on stage and it is unclear which leaders she was referring to.

‘KIND OF DISGUSTING’: HARRIS MAKES MOVE THAT COULD BACKFIRE IN CRITICAL SWING STATE

The rally also took place on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, which is located nearly 90 miles northwest of Dearborn, a city with the nation’s highest per capita Muslim population, which has been at the center of resistance to her campaign.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

A large percentage of Michigan’s Muslim population, which in recent years has been a dependable Democratic voting bloc, has spent much of 2024 resisting the party’s presidential candidates. During the state’s primary campaign, a movement to "Abandon Biden" over the president's handling of the conflict in Gaza led to over 100,000 Michigan residents voting "uncommitted" in place of supporting his bid for re-election.

That movement has since bled over to Harris’ campaign, a reality Trump has tried to capitalize on while pushing a message of ending ongoing wars overseas and bringing peace and stability to the world.

That message has seemingly appealed to some Michigan Muslim leaders.

"We're going to stop the wars, we're going to make the United States safe again, and we're going to make the world safe," Bazzi said during his remarks in Novi.

"What a nice endorsement," Trump said after Bazzi’s speech. "These are great people."

Former President Barack Obama returned to Milwaukee on Sunday, Nov. 3, to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket, and a trio of Republicans rallied support for Trump-Vance ticket later the same day.

Former President Obama in Milwaukee

Obama spoke at 2 p.m. at the Baird Center in downtown Milwaukee. Other prominent Democrats, including Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, spoke beforehand.

"He wants to give another massive tax cut to billionaires and big corporations," Obama said. "Now, some people might hear that and say to themselves, 'I remember the economy being pretty good when he first came into office.' It was, because it was my economy."

The message resonated with voters in attendance, like Melissa Sanchez Perez, who said she's now inspired to get more people to vote.

Before a crowd of more than 5,000 people, according to the Harris campaign, Obama focused some of his speech on the voters who haven't yet cast their ballots.

"I've always said, I respect those who, for religious or ethical reasons, will not consider terminating their own pregnancy," he said. "But if nothing else, freedom must truly mean that women themselves get to make these profound, intimate decisions, not politicians."

"If we don't, we're not gonna have a great place to live anymore," she said.

While Myesha Johnson insisted on bringing her daughter Lauryn to see the former president speak.

"She is the newer generation that's coming up, and she needs to know what her rights are," Johnson said. "And at the end of the day, what's at stake."

Team Trump event

Tulsi Gabbard, Danica Patrick and Sage Steele held a rally at The Factory on Barclay at 6 p.m. in support of Donald Trump.

People lined up two hours early in Walker's Point for the event. Wisconsin voters, even the ones who already voted, say the conversation was energizing.

"I thought it was very inspiring," said Kevin Wisniewski of Milwaukee. "The fact that they were trying to get people energized to come out of the darkness and express your opinions was very uplifting and very energizing."

Their message to Republicans was don't be afraid to speak up.

Patrick said she is a first-time voter.

"I don’t think this is a Democrat versus Republican race because if it was the red, white and blue and the American flag and having pride in this country would be universal, but it’s not," she said.

Gabbard also discussed political divisiveness.

"I encourage you – to be that person who is standing proudly in love knowing we the people must take action to save our country," Gabbard said. "Let’s make it happen."

"I feel like people are waking up realizing okay this didn’t work the past four years," said Paige Cuomo of Milwaukee.

Additionally, FOX6 News confirmed JD Vance will be in La Crosse on Monday, Nov. 4. The Harris campaign said Walz will be in La Crosse, Steven's Point and Milwaukee on Monday.

Battleground Wisconsin

Wisconsin is a critical battleground state in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has pulled closer to Harris in the latest Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin, released on Wednesday.

Harris (50%) leads Trump (49%) among likely voters in a head-to-head matchup. The results included initially undecided voters who were then asked whom they would vote for if they had to choose. When keeping initially undecided voters as a separate category, Harris holds 48% of likely voters, Trump gets 47%, and 5% are undecided.

In Wisconsin, 1.3 million people have already voted. Four of the past six presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a point, with 20,000 votes separating the winner from the loser in both 2016 and 2020. In 2000, Al Gore edged George W. Bush in the state by just 5,700 votes.

2024 Election: Wisconsin Voting Guide, what you need to know

Official statements

WisGOP Chairman Brian Schimming

"From skyrocketing rent to the cost of groceries, the city of Milwaukee knows all too well why this is a make-or-break election for working families. For four years, Kamala Harris stubbornly defended Bidenomics while everyday Americans struggled to stay afloat amid record inflation. To this day, she has zero regrets for the Biden-Harris administration’s mismanagement of the economy. No last-minute appearance by former President Obama can erase the devastating impact of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on the livelihoods of Milwaukeeans."
The New York Times/Siena College final presidential election polls show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a dead heat, with just one point separating the candidates just two days before Election Day.

Polls between the candidates have significantly tightened over the past few weeks, with political pundits noting how close the race will be by Election Day. While NYT/Siena College typically identifies a “clear favorite,” regardless of the outcome, their final polls state this will “not be one of those elections.”

Data from the polls show that in a matchup across several key swing states, 48% of the 7,879 respondents surveyed said they would support Harris, while 47% would back the former president. Less than 1% of respondents indicated they had already voted for a third-party candidate, and 4% either did not know who they were voting for or refused to answer.

In a breakdown of several battleground states, Harris is leading by one point in Georgia and three points in both North Carolina and Wisconsin. In contrast, Trump is ahead by four points in Arizona, one point in Michigan, and the two candidates are dead even in Pennsylvania, according to NYT/Siena College.

A margin of error of plus or minus 1.3 percentage points across the seven battleground states and approximately plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in each state poll has been recorded. The outlet confirmed that 16% of white Democrats were more likely to respond to the polls than white Republicans, creating a “larger disparity” than in previous data and raising the possibility that “the polls could underestimate Mr. Trump yet again.”

While the outlet states that Harris’ position in the Electoral College “isn’t necessarily improved,” the vice president has made gains among her party’s key voting blocs and some swing states compared to the last round of polling. The NYT/Siena College poll found in their final round that Harris’s support among black and Hispanic voters increased, now gaining 84% of black voters’ support compared to 80%, and rising from 55% to 56% among Hispanics.

Harris has also gained support in states where she previously struggled, with her best battleground results coming from her efforts in Nevada. According to the data, Harris now leads the former president by three points in the swing state, which had President Joe Biden losing to Trump by double digits before withdrawing from the race in July.

However, while the poll shows a slim advantage for the vice president, Republicans currently hold a two-point edge in party registration with early voting. Although it is unclear who the voters are supporting, the NYT/Siena poll claimed that, according to their data, Harris is backed by early voters by five points and leads among unaffiliated voters participating in early voting.

Nicole Shanahan, the former vice-presidential running mate of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., shared an ad on Sunday highlighting how it is “the people who are making America great again.”

In a post on X, Shanahan shared a video of clips of former President Donald Trump, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (R-HI), Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), the vice-presidential running mate of Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and Kennedy talking about how the election is about “we, the people choosing our government,” and how Americans should be focusing on rising “above the hatred” and the fear.

The video highlights how people such as Trump, Gabbard, Vance, Ramaswamy, Musk, Kennedy, and Shanahan have united together to make America great.

“It’s the people that Make America Great,” Shanahan wrote in her post. “Unity 2024.”

The advertisement shared by Shanahan starts out with clips of Trump as he can be heard saying, “What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? Look at the opportunities before us.”

“This election really isn’t about the left versus the right,” Gabbard can be heard saying in the video. “It’s about we, the people choosing our government and the choice between freedom versus tyranny.”

“Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have,” Kennedy can be heard saying in the video. “Why are we allowing this to happen to our children? Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.”

Shanahan can be heard saying in the video how what is happening is “deeper than politics,” adding that people “are being called to rise above the hatred and the fear and the evil.”

“We need to remember, above and beyond, that we must love our neighbors, that we must treat other people as we hope to be treated,” Vance says in the video.

In August, Kennedy announced that he was suspending his presidential campaign and endorsed Trump for president. Despite having political differences, Kennedy and Trump revealed that they would be working together to “investigate the corruption of regulatory agencies,” and work to “make America healthy again.”

Gabbard, who recently announced that she was joining the Republican Party, endorsed Trump in August. In her endorsement of Trump, Gabbard highlighted how Trump had not started “any new wars.”

“You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to stick it to the man? Show up on your college campus and trying calling yourself a conservative,” Ramaswamy says in the video.

“America’s going to reach heights that it has never seen before,” Musk says in the video. “The future is gonna be amazing!”

The video continues to show iconic clips from the Trump campaign, such as when Vance went on Theo Von’s podcast, and Trump rode in a garbage truck after President Joe Biden referred to Americans who support Trump as “garbage.”

“Don’t you want healthy children? Don’t you want a president that’s going to make America healthy again?” a clip of Kennedy plays, as another clip shows Shanahan filling out a ballot on stage for Trump as she reveals she is a former Democrat and a “first time Trump voter.”

The video continues to show clips such as Trump appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Gabbard throwing out red “Make America Great Again” hats at the University of Arizona, and Trump serving customers at a Philadelphia McDonald’s.

“The people dreamed this country, and it’s the people who are making America great again,” Trump says in the video.
Vice-presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) claimed that former President Donald Trump is a “dictator” trying to “overturn the Constitution” during his rally in Arizona on Saturday.

“Momentum is on our side, but we take nothing for granted,” the Democrat said to a Tucson audience. “We know in Arizona a vote or two per precinct could be what it takes to win the whole damn race for the country.”

He then posed a hypothetical future in which people would have to tell their children and grandchildren what they did to stop Trump from winning his bid for reelection:

“Someday you’re going to be sitting on that porch,” Walz said.

You’re going to be in that rocking chair, and a little one is going to come up to you after being in school where they’ve been studying the 2024 election, and they’re going to ask when everything was on the line and the American experiment was on the line, and there was somebody running who asked to be a dictator and to overturn the Constitution and talk about using the military against our own people. What did you do to stop that from happening?

“And you’re going to be able to say every damn thing we could, every damn thing we could,” he told the crowd.

C-SPAN

According to pollster FiveThirtyEight, Trump is 2.5 points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona, one of the most important swing states of the election.

Trump has dismissed claims that he would become a dictator, but jokingly told Fox News’s Sean Hannity in December 2023 that he would act as one on “day one” in office.

“We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator,” the former president told Hannity.
The Jewish Press, the largest independent Jewish-American newspaper with a powerful voice among Orthodox communities, has officially endorsed Donald Trump for president in the final days of the election campaign.

The outlet is calling a vote for him “as close to being a moral imperative as we can get,” while deeming his policies crucial for protecting Jewish interests against what it described as the Democrat Party’s “socialist state” vision under Vice President Kamala Harris, marked by “wokeism” and anti-Israel policies.

According to the paper’s editorial board, Trump’s impressive record solidifies his position as their top choice, particularly in contrast to Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.

“Our clear choice for president is Donald Trump,” the Press declared, noting the former president’s strong support of policies that align with Jewish interests, while framing him as a critical counter to Harris’s.

The Press urged readers to consider if they wished for another four years of open borders, “selective” criminal prosecutions of political opponents, “out-of-control” transgender policies, skyrocketing energy costs, rampant inflation, “economic wokeism,” cancel culture, reverse discrimination, equity over equality, rioting over ballots, appeasement of Iran, and disregard for law enforcement.

Harris, the paper argues, has endorsed every Biden administration decision, leading to “soaring” inflation, “social upheaval” from open borders, the “ravages of out-of-control transgenderism,” and the “wokeism” that has shifted businesses from innovators and wealth creators to enforcers of restrictive social agendas.

“Can there be any other answer than ‘no’ to the now familiar election time query; ‘Are you better off now than you were four years ago?’” the Press asked.

Referring to Harris’s support for conditioning U.S. military aid on Israeli policy changes as well as the notion that Israel is somehow guilty of “genocide” in Gaza, the Jewish Press editorial cautions to “be wary” of what she “likely has in mind for Israel” should she be elected president.

The editorial also warns that Democratic control of the presidency and Congress under Harris could lead to Supreme Court “packing,” the end of the Senate filibuster, and policies that could reshape America along socialist lines and an ushering in of a “socialist state.”

“Can anyone really believe that Democratic control of the presidency, Senate and House would not result in the ‘packing’ of the Supreme Court to dilute conservative votes, the end of the Senate’s filibuster and its protection against the tyranny of the majority, and a new, even more precipitous lurch towards the long-feared socialist state than heretofore?” the Press asked.

On the other hand, the paper argues, “we have before us the indelible record of former President Donald Trump!”

“So, a vote for him is as close to being a moral imperative as we can get,” the Press concluded.

The publication’s endorsement of Trump is part of its broader push across federal, state, and local races to support candidates with strong pro-Israel records and solid backing for Jewish communities, deeming it “crucial that Republicans retain control of the House and achieve a majority in the Senate.”

“It is astonishing to us how quickly the Democratic Party has veered to the extreme left and become very hostile towards Israel, with far too few exceptions to boot…,” the paper notes.

With a robust weekly print circulation and an online readership reaching a wide audience, The Jewish Press stands as one of the most influential voices in Jewish-American media, holding significant sway among Jewish and conservative voters across New York and beyond.
Movie star Harrison Ford endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the White House this weekend, characterizing her as the reasonable candidate in the presidential race.

In a video created in partnership with the Harris-Walz campaign, Ford said that he based his endorsement on the testimonies of various former Trump administration officials who have publicly denounced former president Donald Trump.

Harrison Ford: When dozens of former members of the Trump administration are sounding alarms saying ‘For God’s sake, don’t do this again,’ you have to pay attention. They’re telling us something important. I’ve got one vote, same as anyone else, and I’m going to use it to move… pic.twitter.com/C4m4x2Y2qv — Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) November 2, 2024

“When dozens of former members of the Trump administration are sounding alarms, saying, ‘For God’s sake, don’t do this again,’ you have to pay attention,” Ford said. “They’re telling us something important. These aren’t soft people. They’re governors, generals, standing up against the leader of the party they spent their lives advocating for.”

The Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny star then made a plea to Republicans who might be reluctant to vote for Harris, saying he does not agree with everything she and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, believe.

“The truth is this, Kamala Harris will protect your right to disagree with her about policies or ideas, and then, as we have done for centuries, we’ll debate them. We’ll work on them together, and we’ll move forward,” he said. “The other guy, he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge. I’m Harrison Ford. I’ve got one vote — same as anyone else — and I’m going to use it to move forward. I’m going to vote for Kamala Harris.”

Vice President Harris has drastically undermined this assurance from the actor, declaring in recent weeks she would not honor religious freedom objections to abortion procedures, thus essentially “forcing Christians to kill unborn children” if they are healthcare providers.

In another video, Ford said that Harris and Walz “believe in science” and governing for all Americans. In a third video, he said the Trump campaign has been scaring people into voting for them — conspicuously omitting the facts that the Harris-Walz campaign called the former president a fascist who will end democracy and that former President Joe Biden referred to Trump supporters as garbage.

“If you’re still on the fence, here’s a good thing to look at: Who’s trying to scare you into voting for them? Who’s trying to make you look at your neighbors with anger, suspicion, hatred, and who is encouraging you to build something with the people around you?” he said. “It would be really nice to move forward.”

Former President Trump has also been courting celebrity endorsements, including actors Dennis Quaid and Zachary Levi and athletes like Brett Favre and Antonio Brown.

“There’s never been a more important time in our lives than right now in this election,” Favre said at a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday.

“The stakes are incredibly high. Families across Wisconsin are struggling to make ends meet. People’s salaries haven’t kept up with inflation. It’s getting harder for younger people to buy their first home. People are losing hope in the American dream,” he added.
Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to win over voters Saturday evening in a quirky “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) skit, where she chatted with actress Maya Rudolph, who was dressed as Harris herself.

Early reports on Saturday suggested that Harris would make a surprise appearance on the live comedy show, traveling from a rally held earlier in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to ABC News. In the skit’s cold open, Harris joined Rudolph on stage, with the actress playing the vice president’s mirror-image double.

“I’m just here to remind you, you’ve got this because you can do something your opponent can not do, you can open doors,” Harris said, taking a jab at former President Donald Trump.

Rudolph and Harris both laughed at the joke, with the vice president questioning whether she “really” laughs the way the actress was mimicking her. (WATCH HERE: Cleaning Up Kamala)

“A little bit. Now, Kamala, take my palmala. The American people want to stop the chaos, and end the dramala with a cool new step mamala. Kick back in our pajamalas and watch a rom-comala,” Rudolph said. “Because what do we always say?”

“Keep Calm-ala and Carry On-ala,” the two said in unison.

WATCH:

The then two looked out into the audience as Rudolph stated she planned to vote for the vice president, prompting Harris to ask if she was a registered Pennsylvania voter. When Rudolph admitted she wasn’t a swing-state voter, Harris replied it was “worth a shot.”

The skit ended with both of them yelling, “Live from New York, it’s Saturday night!”

Harris wasn’t the only cameo on the show Saturday evening, with former Democrat Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine joining in on a sketch that teased about how he was the forgotten running mate to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Following the airing of the skit, online users quickly pointed out how the scene closely mimicked former President Donald Trump’s appearance on comedian Jimmy Fallon’s “The Tonight Show” in 2015. Within Trump’s version, Fallon sat as a mirrored version of Trump, but was instead questioned about what he would do if he won the 2016 presidential election and how he would help America.

While it is unclear if SNL was intentionally making a nod to the 2015 skit, users on X (formerly known as Twitter) called out the similarities between the two.

Harris has continued to use the help of celebrities and Hollywood elites over the course of her campaign, with artists like Beyonce, Usher and Cardi B recently coming out to support her and speak as a surrogate at her rallies.

Multiple Somali leaders during a news conference on Saturday in Saint Paul, Minnesota, voiced their support for former President Donald Trump as Election Day nears.

The group of men and women from the Muslim and Somali community gathered behind a podium with a “Trump Make America Great Again 2024” sign on it at the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul, per the Alpha News video.

One man who explained he has been a lifelong Republican said he loves Trump. “The reason why is because he’s a fighter. That’s it. We like fighters,” he stated.

“More importantly, the left left us. They left us. Thirty-three percent of our kids in third grade cannot read at grade level… we are failing in every standard. Eighth graders, 60 percent, cannot do math at grade level. These are our kids,” he added:

“We talk about economic conditions here. Our conditions is horrible. We can’t afford anything as working class and middle class people. Now please understand this, we love our brothers and sisters who are Democrats, but you left us. And because the left left us, join the right, vote for Trump 2024,” the man said.

On Monday, surveys showed Trump could be closing in on Minnesota.

“In traditionally blue Minnesota, the race is close as well. A recent MinnPost-Embold Research survey shows Trump trailing Harris by roughly three percentage points, as Harris sees 47.7 percent to Trump’s 45.1 percent support,” the article read.

“Notably, that survey showed independents swinging Trump’s way in Minnesota by a nine-point margin,” it noted.

During a recent rally in Novi, Michigan, several Muslim leaders endorsed Trump, per Breitbart News.

Imam Belal Alzuhairi said, “We as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace, not war. We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen.”
CNN host Dana Bash and political commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson cast doubt Sunday on a new Iowa poll that showed Vice President Kamala Harris holding a significant lead over former President Donald Trump in the red state.

The Des Moines Register/Mediacom released a poll on Saturday evening showing Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 47% to 44%, with pollster Ann Selzer expressing surprise over the results and noting that Harris has “clearly leaped into a leading position,” according to the Des Moines Register. However, on “State of the Union,” Bash highlighted the new data, mentioning that Republicans in the state have expressed skepticism about the numbers.

“Now, Republicans I’ve talked to in Iowa think that that is probably overstating her support. But they do see a trend there with late breakers for Kamala Harris on the female side, on the older side that could be very real [and] not just there but other places,” Bash said.

The CNN host asked Anderson about her own polling, to which the political commentator stated that while she applauds Selzer for being a “great pollster,” sometimes there can be “outliers” within the data. (RELATED: Final 2024 NY Times/Siena College Polls Shows Contradictions, Surprising Shifts In Key States)

“So I’ve also, in my own data, seen senior women trending a little more Democratic. I don’t think it is to the extent that was found in the Selzer poll. But she’s a great pollster, even good pollsters sometimes have outliers and that is why I think what David Axelrod said was so important about uncertainty,” Anderson said.

WATCH:

“This election could be a reboot, that’s sort of what The New York Times/Siena polls are showing. That Harris has rebooted the Obama coalition, she’s getting younger voters, she’s getting voters of color to turnout for her in big numbers,” Anderson added. “But this also could be a realignment, and that’s what the Trump team is hoping for.”

Anderson went on to state that despite Trump’s potential losses among senior women voters, he could be making it up within other key voting blocs.

“That they’re actually doing better with younger voters, better with voters of color than expected. So even if they are losing seniors by a little bit, especially senior women, they’re making up that ground in other places,” Anderson continued.

“We don’t yet know if this is a reboot or a realignment, and just because the polls are generally showing this race close I want to be clear the uncertainty is not just, ‘We don’t know who’s going to win.’ It’s also possible that one of these candidates could run away with this. The uncertainty is not just, ‘Well we’re sure it’ll be close.’ We’re not sure of anything right now,” Anderson concluded.

National polls between Harris and Trump have been neck-in-neck the past month despite Trump gaining on several of the key swing states in mid-October. Average polling data from RealClearPolitics, shows Trump with a 0.1-point lead over Harris nationally, holding 48.4% of the vote and Harris at 48.3%.

Former President Donald Trump dealt with some American adversaries harshly during his first term, threatening them with military action and choking their economies. Now that Trump is on the verge of being reelected, those adversaries are panicking — and trying to prevent Trump from the White House.

Trump is in a dead-heat race against Vice President Kamala Harris in next Tuesday’s presidential elections. Nations making up the so-called “Axis of Evil” — especially Iran and China — have made it clear they do not want Trump to win. That’s borne in part out of anger against Trump for his actions during his first term and fear of what he will do in his second, according to a review of multiple reports. (RELATED: Trump Reportedly Told Netanyahu Israel Needs To Finish Gaza War By Time He Takes Office)

It’s an open secret that Iran and China have attempted to interfere in elections in the past, as they are this year. Both countries have utilized a variety of methods to interfere with Trump’s bid for the White House. That’s particularly true for Iran, which has attempted to kill Trump and waged cyberwarfare operations against his campaign.

“While the Islamic Republic continues to mean what it says when it calls for ‘death to America,’ there is only one current presidential contender whom the regime and its terrorist network are trying to kill. That is Donald Trump,” Behnam Ben Taleblu, a scholar on Iranian affairs at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That is born of a clear understanding in the regime’s mind that he is the candidate of real pressure.”

Trump’s approach to Iran — the largest state sponsor of terrorism and an accomplice in the killing of scores of U.S. troops over recent years — was described by his administration as a “maximum pressure” campaign. Trump withdrew from the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal in 2018, arguing that it allowed Tehran to rake in billions of dollars under eased sanctions while failing to prevent it from building a nuclear weapon. He replaced the deal with harsh sanctions that cut off many of the country’s revenue streams.

“Trump demonstrated he’s willing to hit them hard. This isn’t the same approach we’re seeing from the current administration, which is why Iran’s focus remains on Trump,” former senior Pentagon official and Strauss Center fellow Simone Ledeen told the DCNF.

Iran’s network of terrorist groups suffered from a lack of funding as a result of Trump’s approach, but remained incredibly hostile to the U.S., launching multiple attacks on American forces in the Middle East in the following year. As attacks escalated, Trump made the decision to launch a drone strike and assassinate top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani while he was visiting Iraq in 2020.

Soleimani was a pivotal figure in the Iranian military, and his death greatly angered Tehran.

“The Soleimani strike… exposed some of Iran’s vulnerabilities,” Ledeen told the DCNF.

Iran has since staged multiple unsuccessful assassination attempts against Trump through various actors. The reports on the matter have seemed to escalate in recent months as the election draws close; U.S. intelligence officials briefed the Trump campaign in September on a previous assassination operation, which failed.

Iran has also carried out various cyberwarfare campaigns against Trump ahead of the election, some of which have been successful. Iranian-backed hackers gained access to internal Trump campaign documents — specifically regarding research about Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance — and leaked it to various media outlets and reporters in August and September, only some of whom published the material. (RELATED: UK Socialist Leader Insists He’s Still Good Friends With Trump After Party Staffers Plan Trip To Help Harris)

Iranian hackers also accessed and leaked a number of internal Trump campaign emails, which made their way into public reporting. The U.S. charged three Iranian operatives for the action in late September.

“If Trump is back, I’d expect Iran to ramp up its threats,” Ledeen told the DCNF. “Another Trump term would bring renewed pressure, and Iran’s leaders know that. They’ll likely grow more desperate and aggressive as they try to hold onto control in the region, but they’re not in the position they once were.”

If Trump wins, he’ll need to be ready to face down Tehran a second time — while making it clear his contention is not with the Iranian people, who have suffered under the authoritarian Islamic regime, Taleblu told the DCNF.

“While one of the strengths of former President Trump was his ability to keep the adversary guessing, I think it’s quite clear at a minimum a future Trump administration would return to a policy of maximum pressure, and begin to put meaningful and sustained pressure on oil and petrochemical exports and financial flows,” Taleblu told the DCNF.

“What a prospective Trump administration will need to be prepared for is how Tehran might be inclined to respond to pressure with pressure of its own,” Taleblu said. “And that’s why to offset escalation by the regime, as well as to do the moral and politically astute thing, Trump will need to pair maximum pressure against the regime with a real policy of maximum support for the Iranian people.”

The Trump campaign told the DCNF that Iran is “terrified” of a second Trump presidency.

“The terror regime in Iran loves the weakness and stupidity of Kamala Harris,” spokesman Steven Cheung said.

China has also been incredibly wary of a second Trump term, according to multiple reports. Chinese officials are reportedly fearful of Trump because he appears more unpredictable than Harris.

Publicly, Beijing refuses to say who it would rather deal with. But privately, officials were previously hoping that President Joe Biden would beat out Trump in the elections because they felt Biden was less of a threat, according to officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal earlier in October . (RELATED: Biden’s Top Intelligence Official Reportedly Weighing Whether To Call It Quits In Gov’t — Even If Harris Wins)

When Biden dropped out of the race in July, officials shifted their preference to Harris, even though neither candidate is likely that favorable to Beijing, according to the WSJ. China has expressed ire to Republican and Democratic administrations over the years and has launched cyberattack operations against both parties.

But Trump’s strict policies in particular caused headaches for officials, and they may be expecting similar policies if he wins again.

“They know a lot about what Donald Trump’s approach to government, diplomacy, trade negotiations might be, and they know a lot about what he said through the entirety of the campaign,” Steve Yates, senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute, told the DCNF. “That is a challenge to them.”

Part of the fear among Chinese officials is that Trump will launch a second trade war if reelected. During his first term, Trump imposed heavy tariffs on China, significantly raising the tax on some incoming Chinese imports and deterring Americans from buying Chinese-made goods. Trump’s goal was to balance out the U.S.-China trade relationship and compel China to buy more American goods.

Trump has already publicly mused the idea of imposing 60% tariffs on Chinese goods if he wins back the White House, something Beijing is eager to avoid.

U.S. officials have said they’ve seen evidence of China trying to interfere in this year’s elections. It was reported last week that Chinese-backed hackers targeted data on Trump’s and Vance’s phones. It wasn’t clear what, if any, information was stolen, but it could be beneficial to Beijing if anything was taken. Members of Harris’ staff were also reportedly targeted.

A spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. claimed that Beijing was unaware of the hacking operation.

“We cannot comment [on] it… China firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms,” the spokesperson said. “We hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election.”

A number of “bot” social media accounts linked to China have also been targeting Republican congressional candidates, according to a report released last week by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center.

“While not always resulting in high levels of engagement, these efforts demonstrate China’s sustained attempts [to] influence U.S. politics across the board,” Clint Watts, general manager of the tech company’s agency, wrote in a post regarding the report.

The Biden-Harris administration has been anything but cooperative in helping state election officials track noncitizens on voter rolls. Perhaps that has something to do with the real Big Lie that the federal “honor system” stops foreign nationals from registering to vote and casting ballots.

As of this weekend, Iowa’s senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst seemed to be getting nowhere with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Republicans are demanding the agency immediately respond to Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate’s request for assistance to track the citizenship status of nearly 2,200 registered Iowa voters “who self-identified as non-citizens.”

“Anything short of the information Secretary Pate requested is unacceptable. Iowa has worked in good faith to secure its electoral process and safeguard Americans’ cherished right to vote. Unfortunately, USCIS’ stonewalling has led to more questions than answers,” Grassley and Ernst wrote in a joint statement issued Saturday.

‘Time Is of the Essence’

While USCIS’s Des Moines Field Office has completed its review, the federal agency’s headquarters is refusing to turn the information over to state officials, according to the lawmakers and Pate.

On Thursday, Pate sent Grassley a letter alerting the senator about his “urgent pleas” to USCIS to release the critical data.

“Time is of the essence, as voting in Iowa has been underway since October 16 and Iowa election law requires absentee ballots be separated from their carrier envelopes on Monday, November 4,” the senators wrote in a joint letter to Immigration Services. “We expect a response to this letter and for the information to be released to Iowa’s Secretary of State by end of day Friday, November 1. If that doesn’t happen, you will be playing into the very serious concerns of Iowans that the Biden-Harris administration is not following federal law and not taking reasonable measures to ensure only citizens are voting in our federal elections.”

The response never came.

Pate noted in his request for urgent federal intervention that his office reviewed voter registration data, comparing an Iowa Department of Transportation file of foreign nationals to the I-Voters registration system. The review found 2,176 registrants who self-reported as noncitizens, ineligible to vote under state and federal law but registered to vote, nonetheless.

The secretary’s office also discovered 154 registrants “who had self-reported to the DOT as non-citizens after registering to vote or voting.”

“There is reasonable suspicion that any voter on either list is a non-citizen,” Pate wrote in his Halloween letter to Grassley.

‘The Work Has Been Done’

While the Des Moines Field Office of USCIS reviewed the suspect names with the assistance of the state DOT supplying Alien Registration Numbers, headquarters in Washington, D.C., will not allow the Iowa office to share the information.

“This information would be critical to Iowa’s election officials in this process and ensure naturalized citizens can cast their ballots as normal,” Pate wrote.

The Biden-Harris Department of Justice has threatened to challenge Iowa’s process of vetting the voting rolls. Pate wrote that he asked the DOJ to allow their Immigration Services colleagues in D.C. to turn over the data that’s been completed in Des Moines.

“The work has been done. The most current, verified information is available. Yet, Washington, D.C. will not share it with us. We have heard it before — ‘see something, say something.’ The federal government has said it themselves but have not followed through,” Pate wrote to Grassley, expressing his frustration with the federal bureaucrats. “If the federal government has information that will ensure only U.S. citizens vote AND ensure naturalized citizens can cast their ballot as normal, that information must be shared.”

Pate said the D.C. office has only responded by saying that Iowa’s request is “being sent to an executive level within the Department.” The request, according to the USCIS, will “require extensive research and review by multiple oversight offices,” Pate notes in the letter.

It appears the Biden-Harris administration is engaging in classic executive branch stonewalling. Perhaps that’s not surprising from an administration led by a president who has threatened to veto a bill that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote, an administration powered by a weaponized Department of Justice that harasses states for removing foreign nationals from their voter rolls.

A USCIS official did not return The Federalist’s request for comment.

As of Saturday evening, the USCIS has refused to release the requested data, according to Grassley’s office.

“We reiterate our demand for USCIS to immediately release the requested information, to ensure all eligible citizens can participate in our elections. With Election Day right around the corner, there’s no time for federal officials to waste,” the senators said in the statement blasting the agency.

‘It’s Hardly a Coincidence’

The Biden-Harris administration’s recalcitrance in assisting election officials who seek to verify voter citizenship extends beyond the Hawkeye State’s borders.

In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security grant his agency access to U.S. citizenship records, information LaRose says DHS has unlawfully withheld.

Filed in federal court for the U.S. Southern District of Ohio, the complaint alleges the Biden-Harris administration has on multiple occasions refused to provide the Buckeye State access to citizenship verification records. As The Federalist reported last month, the agency has repeatedly refused to answer LaRose’s requests.

Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, has attempted to intervene on the secretary of state’s behalf, without success. In a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Jordan charged the agency with engaging in “a clear effort to intimidate and interfere with Ohio’s electoral process.”

“LaRose has tried to ensure that eligible voters — and not ineligible noncitizens — participate in Ohio’s elections,” the congressman wrote. “We expect your full cooperation with our oversight of your attempt to prevent states from ensuring that noncitizens do not influence our democracy.”

He got more stonewalling. So LaRose sued.

“While the administration is blocking access to these records, the Department of Justice is suing or threatening to sue multiple states, including Ohio, who are trying to enforce their citizenship voting requirements,” the secretary of state said in a press release. “It’s hardly a coincidence. The same administration that’s presided over the most reckless, porous immigration policy in our country’s history is also intentionally blocking states from protecting the integrity of their elections.”

LaRose’s office has found hundreds of foreign nationals on the state’s voter rolls, directing that those individuals be removed from the registration list. In August, LaRose referred 138 noncitizens discovered on the voter rolls to state Attorney General Dave Yost’s office for prosecution. The secretary of state said it appears the individuals have voted in past elections. Late last month, Yost announced that his office was indicting six individuals on charges of illegally voting as noncitizens in Ohio elections over the past several years. The Republican AG said many of the 138 cases referred by LaRose involved “improper voter registration,” but Yost said he has no authority to prosecute in those cases.

Nothing to see here, Democrats insist.

On a related note, a federal judge last week rejected the leftist ACLU’s push to stop LaRose’s efforts to require that voters whose citizenship status is challenged provide naturalization papers.

LaRose called the ruling a “big legal win for election integrity.”

“You can’t make this up — the [ACLU of Ohio] sued me to try to force us to accept NON CITIZEN IDs without proof of citizenship,” LaRose wrote on X. “We fought and WE WON! American elections are only for American Citizens and in Ohio we make sure of it.”

🚨Another big legal win for election integrity🚨



You can't make this up—the @ACLUOhio sued me to try to force us to accept NON CITIZEN IDs without proof of citizenship.



We fought and WE WON!



American elections are only for American Citizens and in Ohio we make sure of it. — Frank LaRose (@FrankLaRose) October 30, 2024

The ACLU is pulling the same stunt in Iowa, representing four voters and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in suing Pate for challenging the votes of apparent noncitizens. The secretary of state asks that the individuals provide proof of citizenship. They have seven days to do so.

An ACLU official told the Associated Press that Pate is disenfranchising voters by asking them to provide proof of citizenship. Federal law currently requires only that individuals registering to vote attest that they are U.S. citizens.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said LULAC is attempting a last-minute effort to “let noncitizens illegally vote.”

“I am fighting to defend our long-standing election integrity laws and ensure Iowans can maintain trust in our elections,” she said in a statement.

Top Republicans believe that former President Donald Trump is fueling high turnout in down-ballot New York House races, sources familiar exclusively told Breitbart News.

Battleground races in New York could decide the balance of power in the House. In 2022, New York Republican victories enabled the GOP to clench control of the chamber. If Republicans defeat Democrats in 2024 and retain their seats, the party will have a strong chance of retaining a House majority.

All GOP-targeted districts have so far outperformed their historical 2022 turnout margins by as much as 50 percent, sources familiar with early vote data told Breitbart News. The districts reaching the 50 percent threshold are 4, 17, 18, and 19.

Sources tell Breitbart News the positive turnout is driven by support for former President Donald Trump and House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik’s (R-NY) ground game operation.

Stefanik has now spent nearly $3 million dollars on early vote efforts between her House GOP battleground fund, the NRCC, and NYGOP, per one source familiar with the effort.

Stefanik’s ground game during the 2022 midterms is widely credited for handing Republicans control of the House and preventing the Biden-Harris administration from passing more legislation to fuel inflation and enact amnesty measures.

“For the first time, New York is possibly in play for the presidential race and will certainly determine the House Majority,” Stefanik told Breitbart News:

Republicans across New York and the country are voting early in historic numbers, but we must not get complacent and must keep up the momentum and continue working to turn voters out. I’m calling on all Republicans to ensure their family, friends, and neighbors get out to vote early in person or on Election Day.”

Alex DeGrasse, executive director of Team Elise who oversees the early vote program told Breitbart News that House Democrats are in deep trouble.

“NY Democrats led by Kathy Hochul are in total free fall. No amount of spin can hide that. NY Republicans are turning out in record numbers for Early In-Person voting, vastly outperforming our 2022 margins in every seat, some by 50 percent,” he said:

The Democrat Vote-By-Mail ‘firewall’ is the lowest it’s ever been as we see Democrats failing to return their ballots. Long Island looks great, as does the Hudson Valley and Upstate,” he said. “Lastly, Democrats should be panicking about NY-03, where Republicans are running near even with Democrats in Early In-Person Voting because it’s clearly TRUMP COUNTRY.” Republicans must spend the weekend, now dubbed the weekend of mass mobilization, getting themselves and every like minded patriot they know out to vote early in person. The early polling locations close tomorrow, if we continue to run up our score in early voting we are in a position to bring it home in all 5 defense seats and our two offensive targets. A Year ago no one in the mainstream media thought we would be here, but here we are, It’s not over and we must continue the momentum through Election Day to protect our House Majority which will be decided right here in New York.

Below is early vote data through day six of early voting (October, 31), per the New York State Board of Elections.

Early Vote Data by District (Republican/Democrat Margin Toplines):

District 1 – Rep. Nicholas LaLota (R): + 9.24%

District 3 – Michael LiPetri (R): – 3.04%

District 4 – Anthony D’Esposito (R): – 1.85%

District 17 – Mike Lawler (R): – 8.42%

District 18 – Alison Esposito: – 8.73%

District 19 – Marc Molinaro (R): – 16.35%

District 21 – Stefanik (R): + 13.22%

District 22 – Brandon Williams (R): – 2.78%

Change in Republican/Democrat Margin from 2022 to 2024:

District 1 – LaLota: + 12.39 points

District 3 – LiPetri: + 8.74 points

District 4 – D’Esposito: + 2.37 points

District 17 – Lawler: + 11.16 points

District 18 – Esposito: + 17.29 points

District 19 – Molinaro: + 17.49 points

District 21 – Stefanik: + 14.66 points

District 22 – Williams: + 14.92 points

The positive numbers for Republicans appear to be upsetting Democrats and their media allies. Politico’s New York Playbook warned Democrats on Saturday about the “good” numbers for Republicans:

New York Democrats are trying to project calm, saying they had expected these Republican voters to cast their ballot anyway — it’s just that a surprising number are doing it via early voting. … In the seven Democrat-designated battleground districts, just 41 percent of early voters are registered Democrats. Another 34 percent are Republicans and 20 percent are unaffiliated, according to state Dems. In the state where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one and Biden handily won almost every battleground congressional district, that split looks good for Republicans.

Trump believes New York State House races could determine the balance of power in the House, the former president said on a tele-rally last weekend with Stefanik. The tele-rally, lead by Stefanik, dialed out to nearly one million Trump supporters to push early voting, a source familiar with Stefanik’s effort told Breitbart News.

“We are doing very well upstate. We’re doing very well in Long Island and certain parts over there, like literally at 90 and 95 percent and Upstate is the same thing, and we should be doing the best of all in Manhattan,” Trump said, “[where] the people are living on the streets. I’ve never seen vacant stores on Madison Avenue. And the other day I went by and like almost it seemed that 50 percent of the stores are vacant. I’ve never seen a vacant store on Madison or Fifth Avenue, and you look now, it’s all vacant.”

“We want to get everybody out [to vote] because we think we could actually win New York,” Trump told supporters on the call. “We’re leading, as you know, in all the swing states, and I think we’re leading potentially very big. We set a record in early voting, and a lot of them were voters that don’t vote that much, which is pretty amazing.”

Former President Donald Trump is poised to secure a significant electoral victory, potentially “sweeping battleground states,” according to Rasmussen’s head pollster, who sees the current race favoring Trump in the national popular vote, suggesting a larger “political realignment” is underway, and foreseeing an outcome that could echo — or even exceed — Ronald Reagan’s historic landslide win over Jimmy Carter in 1980.

In a striking forecast days before the 2024 presidential election, Rasmussen’s head pollster, Mark Mitchell, is suggesting that Donald Trump will secure a strong lead nationally and dominate in key battleground states, positioning him for a sweeping victory. Mitchell even foresees a potential flip of Virginia and New Hampshire, adding that other states, like Minnesota or New Mexico, might follow suit.

“What you’re hearing out there is that the polls are close, and I think that’s wrong,” he told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Friday, adding, “I think the polls on average show a strong Trump win, and my polls taken independently show that as well.”

On the likelihood of a battleground sweep and national popular vote win for Trump, he pointed to a “major political realignment.”

“I think the pollsters are having a hard time keeping up with that, us included,” he said. “Party [affiliation] means a lot less than whether you support Trump or Harris.”

Pointing to Trump’s tendency to outperform polls, he added, “I really don’t think he’s going to buck that trend. So I think he’s going to surprise people in the swing states by being to the right of the polls.”

Reflecting on public dissatisfaction with the current administration, he noted, “People don’t care who Kamala Harris is.”

“They care that she’s part of the Biden administration, and the Biden administration has been deeply unpopular,” he said, contrasting the vice president with Trump, who is familiar to Americans and has “already been through all of the convictions and cases and surprises.”

Mitchell expressed his belief that this year’s race has been stable, with a consistent national lead for Trump.

“The truth is, the race hasn’t changed,” he said, describing the dynamic as “locked in at a Trump plus two national popular vote.”

Despite some polling shifts in Harris’s favor, the Rasmussen pollster argues that Trump’s performance has improved from 2020.

“You can argue [that] maybe it’s a point to the right or a point to the left, but what you can’t argue is it’s six or seven points better than Trump was doing against Biden [compared to this time in 2020],” he said, underscoring a distinct advantage for Trump this cycle.

Polling Dynamics

Mitchell noted that Trump appears stronger in swing states than in past cycles.

“He’s doing way better than he ever has in previous cycles,” he said, pointing out that if Trump outperforms his previous national vote margins and the battlegrounds track similarly, “that means Trump sweeps the swing states… a big win.”

He then drew a parallel between the current race and the 1980 Reagan-Carter election, comparing Trump’s support to Reagan’s widespread appeal and high favorability that led to a landslide victory.

“A lot of people have been talking about 1980,” he explained, noting how Reagan’s broad support culminated in a decisive win. “If you stripped [John] Anderson out of that race and gave most of his votes to Carter, then that could be what we’re looking at,” he observed.

Despite media reports showing Harris with sporadic leads, Mitchell believes some polls are misleadingly skewed toward Harris.

“I wrote in a post two or three weeks ago, ‘Is this what 1980 would look like if the pollsters back then had the internet?’” he remarked, suggesting that certain outlets have manipulated polling to bolster Harris.

“I think really, the plan was to shill for Harris and try and get her over the hump,” he added.

Rasmussen’s own polls, he explained, have shown “the race locked in at Trump plus two the entire time.”

Swing States and Early Voting Strategy

Mitchell highlighted Trump’s strength in swing states and addressed Republicans’ strategic push for early voting, which could offer Trump an advantage.

Among people planning to vote on Election Day, he said, “Trump is up between seven and twelve points,” signaling Trump’s support is still strong.

He suggested that early voting results in certain states — even outside of the battleground — could signal a Trump landslide victory as soon as the polls close.

“If the early returns are just so overwhelming that they can’t dig out of the hole,” he speculated, “the media [could be] calling it regardless of what the Secretaries of State say.”

Specific states like Virginia and New Hampshire, he stated, could indicate broader trends if they show early Trump wins.

“It’s possible we’ll see an early flip of Virginia and New Hampshire,” he said, adding that early Republican turnout in Virginia has been notably strong, with even traditionally Democratic areas seeing a Republican surge.

“I don’t think New Jersey is going to flip, but my point is that Trump is probably trailing by less than half of what he was nearly four years ago in New Jersey,” he added, noting that such a fact indicates that “some of these other places, like Minnesota or New Mexico could be flips too.”

Media Coverage, Harris’s Impact, and Voter Enthusiasm

Discussing Harris’s nomination over Biden, Mitchell suggested it may have little impact on Democratic voter motivation.

“Democrats are mostly voting out of fear,” he observed. “Their number one issues [are] ‘Trump’s a threat to democracy’ and abortion, and those are fear [messages].”

Despite a brief boost in Harris’s favorability after she was nominated, he suggested that any improvement was likely due to favorable press coverage.

“Quite frankly, Biden wasn’t getting [the coverage]. He should be mad. He should sue – the media threw him under the bus,” he noted, questioning whether Harris truly resonates with Democratic voters in swing states.

Mitchell emphasized that enthusiasm among Trump supporters remains high, although traditional polls may not fully capture it. He pointed out that online respondents can sometimes overestimate their likelihood to vote, which could distort enthusiasm levels.

“Trump’s people are going to turn out,” he stated confidently. He downplayed the possibility of Harris outperforming polls across battlegrounds, saying, “I really don’t see any logical or data-based counter to say, ‘Well, Kamala Harris is going to, across the board, outperform the polls nationally.’”

Reflecting on the broader trajectory of the election, he reiterated his view of an impending Trump victory with potential to sweep the battleground states.

“I think we’re [looking at] 1980 minus Anderson, as in, if you gave most of his votes to Carter,” he concluded. “I think it’s probably going to be Trump plus three nationally.”

The 1980 U.S. presidential election marked a historic landslide victory for Republican Ronald Reagan over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter, despite polls indicating a tight race beforehand. Reagan’s triumph, with 489 electoral votes to Carter’s 49 and a nearly 10-point lead in the popular vote, became emblematic of a political realignment that shaped conservative momentum.

The election also marked the last time an incumbent Democratic president was unseated — a rare feat, as Reagan managed to win both the popular and electoral vote over Carter.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris for her lack of support for Israel, arguing that the decision not to tap Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate was a result of the vice president caving to the "pro-Hamas" wing of the Democratic Party.

"You oughta ask yourself why didn’t she pick Josh Shapiro as her VP?" Cruz said during an appearance on Fox News’ "Sunday Morning Futures" with Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. "The answer is, in today’s Democrat Party, they could not stomach a candidate who was Jewish."

Cruz’s comments come just two days before polls open on Election Day, with both Harris and former President Trump making their final pitches in the seven key battleground states that promise to decide the race.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: ARIZONA IS TRUMP'S TO LOSE, BUT THIS ELECTION IS ANYONE'S TO WIN

Two battlegrounds in particular, Michigan and Pennsylvania, show the struggle Harris has had cobbling together a winning coalition, Cruz argued, noting that the vice president has tried to appease Jewish voters in Pennsylvania despite the administration she serves in being the "most anti-Israel" one in American history.

"Kamala Harris is lying to people in Pennsylvania, and we know that because she’s not just some random person off the street, she’s been the sitting vice president for four years," Cruz said. "Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been the single most anti-Israel administration this country has ever seen."

The Real Clear Politics polling average shows an extremely tight race in Pennsylvania in the final days of the election, with Trump currently holding a slim 0.3 point lead in the critical battleground state.

Betting odds for the race are similarly close, with ElectionBettingOdds.com showing Trump with 53.5% chance of winning Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the latest Fox News Power Rankings rate the swing state as a toss-up.

Cruz suggested Sunday that Shapiro, who currently enjoys positive approval ratings among voters in his state, could have helped win the key state for Harris if she had chosen him.

"Shapiro might well have won the state of Pennsylvania for her, but the pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party could not imagine, could not tolerate, such a thing," Cruz said.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.
Afghans for Trump group push to make foreign policy, 2021 withdrawal front and center in election

​

Three years have passed since the Taliban's swift takeover upended Afghanistan.

Women have largely taken up home confinement, and men live in fear of being suspected of aiding the resistance, a charge that could result in death. In the chaos, as the U.S. hastily withdrew, countless Afghan allies were abandoned to an uncertain fate.

While the wall-to-wall press coverage of what’s been called President Biden’s "Saigon moment" has largely quieted down, the Afghan diaspora living in the U.S. has not forgotten relatives in the homeland.

Zoubair Sangi helped found a movement for the Afghan diaspora to unite and bring a sense of betrayal by the Biden administration to the ballot box with the new advocacy group Afghans for Trump.

"If you were to ask [Afghans in Afghanistan], would you want a continuation of the last three years, which has been the failed policy of the Biden-Harris administration? They would say no because their lives are miserable right now," Sangi told Fox News Digital.

"It's been three years where women can't go to school. Terrorism has been on the rise. We have the attacking of ethnic and religious minorities."

Sangi’s parents came to the U.S. in the 1980s as the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.

Much of his family still lives in the nation.

"What they say is that it feels like they're living in a prison," Sangi said.

"Anyone who’s suspected of resistance, just being kidnapped, jailed, tortured, killed. For the last three years, this has been going on. But zero coverage. So, you know, those who are living here, they feel like they've lost everything."

Sangi says Afghans for Trump is reaching out to the diaspora, those who are Afghan by background but U.S. citizens, and has been in touch with recent refugees who left after the withdrawal, most of whom are not citizens and can’t vote in the election.

This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Morgan Phillips
After an Orthodox Jewish man was shot while walking to his synagogue on the Sabbath in Rogers Park, Chicago, last weekend, media outlets quickly gathered and disseminated information about the victim’s background. It was the media that also first confirmed that the suspect, 22-year-old Sidi Mohamed Abdallahi, was a Mauritanian national who was in the U.S. illegally.

After the attack, fear rose within Chicago’s Jewish community about the lack of information from the Chicago Police Department and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who took five days to acknowledge the religious background of Abdallahi’s Jewish victim. Police also did not tell the public what Abdallahi shouted while shooting at officers, refusing to confirm the substance of Ring camera footage that was circulating, although they did acknowledge that "there was something stated."

Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that "there is a clear cover-up going on to seal off information flow before next week’s election. They knew about the shooter’s illegal status from the moment they ran his ID."

"This should be a national scandal," Goldberg added.

GROWING CALLS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TO BE CHARGED WITH HATE CRIMES IN JEWISH MAN’S SHOOTING

Abdallahi’s address, listed in a police news release, is 27 miles from Rogers Park. Goldberg noted that he went out of his way to travel a significant distance for the alleged attack.

The suspect's alleged antisemitic motives then became a key theme during the Oct. 31 news conference where Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling announced long-awaited additional felony charges against Abdallahi for a hate crime and terrorism, bringing the total number of charges against Abdallahi to 16.

"We did not secure these charges because of public pressure or because of media attention," Snelling told reporters. "Gathering evidence and facts takes time." Snelling explained that detectives had been unable to interview Abdallahi, who remains hospitalized after being shot by police. Evidence on the suspect’s phone "indicated he planned the shooting and specifically targeted people of the Jewish faith."

Chicago officials did not provide details about Abdallahi’s immigration status in their news conference. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson Erin Bultje confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdallahi was apprehended while entering the country near San Ysidro in March and was subsequently released inside the U.S.

"It’s pretty obvious what happened here," said Goldberg, a former NSC official in the Trump administration. "We have an act of terrorism committed by someone who entered the country illegally and was allowed to stay under Biden-Harris policies. And the second Democratic officials realized the potential impact that might have on the presidential election, they panicked and tried to lock down information flow. But the Jewish community fought back."

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION STATUS REVEALED IN SHOOTING OF JEWISH MAN IN DEM-CONTROLLED CITY

Just two months ago, Canadian authorities arrested a 20-year-old Pakistani man who had plotted to carry out an attack on the Jewish community in Brooklyn, New York.

At Thursday’s news conference, a WGN journalist brought up ICE’s confirmation of Abdallahi’s Mauritanian nationality and asked whether State’s Attorney Kim Foxx planned to comply with the ICE detainer for Abdallahi lodged with the Cook County jail.

"What we’re doing today is announcing the charges," Foxx replied. "Next week, when we do the full-on proffer, we can confirm the information that you have." Because the suspect "is presumed innocent until proven guilty" and "has not had the opportunity to appear before a judge and face the charges," Foxx said she was "not going to give a level of specificity that has not been afforded to him."

Pat Brady, former federal and state prosecutor in Illinois, confirmed to Fox News Digital that "it’s not unusual that the details are not made publicly available until the formal arraignment."

Stay-at-home mother Malka Reich, who reportedly witnessed a portion of the attack that partially took place in her front yard – Ring camera footage of the incident taken at her home has been widely disseminated – told Fox News Digital that she believes "the mayor and potentially people in the federal government are trying to hide" key elements of the hate crime.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FACES HATE CRIME, TERRORISM CHARGES IN SHOOTING OF JEWISH MAN IN CHICAGO

During Thursday’s press conference, Johnson was asked why he had failed to identify the victim’s religious background in previous statements. Johnson was widely condemned for sending "heartfelt thoughts and prayers" to the victim without describing him as being Jewish.

Rather than answer the question, Johnson explained that "my responsibility as the mayor of Chicago is to keep every single community safe, and I take that responsibility seriously." Johnson added that "terror wants to incite and ignite and make people feel isolated and alone. But the Jewish community is not alone. We’re standing firm with our Jewish siblings as I always have."

Johnson has received condemnation in the past for adding to an environment of antisemitism inside Chicago, including through his tie-breaking vote in support of a January cease-fire resolution that was pushed by anti-Israel activists and passed by the City Council.

According to the Chicago Police Department’s Hate Crime Dashboard, there have been 71 anti-Jewish hate crimes in the city in 2024, up from 50 in 2023, and 39 in 2022.

Among many Jewish Chicagoans dissatisfied with early responses to Saturday’s shooting was Alderman Debra Silverstein, who spoke with Fox News Digital before Abdallahi’s hate crime charge was announced. Silverstein expressed the feeling in Chicago’s Jewish community that "City Hall does not have their back."

Silverstein is also worried about antisemitism in Chicago Public Schools. After the Chicago City Council cease-fire resolution was passed, students staged a pro-Palestinian walkout in which Silverstein said that some Chicago students "were told not to wear blue and white" because the schools "weren’t sure that they would be able to protect them."

Amid the battle over facts in Abdallahi’s shooting, the Jewish Insider broke a story that the newly appointed president of the Chicago Board of Education, the Rev. Mitchell Johnson, had "a lengthy history of posting inflammatory antisemitic, anti-Israel and pro-Hamas content on social media."

Silverstein said she quickly rallied around 40 aldermen and the city clerk to call for the Rev. Johnson’s resignation. By Oct. 31, the mayor stated that he asked for and received the Rev. Johnson’s resignation, calling the reverend’s comments "not only hurtful but deeply disturbing." The mayor stated that "antisemitic, misogynistic and conspiratorial statements are unacceptable."

Silverstein said that she was "happy that [the Rev. Johnson] resigned" but that "he never should have been appointed in the first place; and my question is who and how was he vetted in the beginning, and now I’m concerned about the other members and the vetting process for them as well."

Fox News Digital repeatedly reached out to Mayor Johnson and Gov. J.B. Pritzker for comment and clarification about the shooting victim’s religion, the environment of antisemitism in Chicago and other developments in Abdallahi’s case. Neither office responded.

The Chicago Police Department, in response to questions about the shooter, referred Fox News Digital to its prior news releases.
A man is accused of beating up a stranger who was wearing a Trump 2024 hat on Friday in Bath, New York.

The Village of Bath Police Department officers were called to a fight at the Tops Friendly Markets on West Morris Street around 10:00 a.m., the agency said in a press release:

It was determined that Robert Yott, 60, of Bath, initiated a confrontation with a stranger inside Tops, after becoming aggressive over the fact that the stranger was wearing a Trump 2024 hat. Mr. Yott punched the victim in the mouth and head several times, causing the victim’s teeth to be broken and mouth bloody. Mr. Yott was not known to the victim and this appears to be a random act of violence.

Police said Yott was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree assault, and fourth degree criminal mischief.

He was later taken to Steuben County Jail “where he is currently awaiting CAP arraignment,” the department added:

Trump hats have been in the news lately as Election Day, which is on Tuesday, nears.

A pair of American women were booted from a flight out of Heathrow airport in London that was on its way to Austin, Texas, after a brawl reportedly occurred in regard to one of them wearing a Make America Great Again hat, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday.

Prior to that incident, an audience member at the first game of the World Series garnered criticism from leftists because the woman was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat while sitting in the front row just behind home plate, the outlet reported on October 27.

“The woman donning the pro-Donald Trump cap was simply watching the Friday game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees when she became the subject of a barrage of angry social media posts calling her a ‘piece of shit’ and a ‘bitch,'” the article read.

The incidents happened after former President Donald Trump (R), who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris (D) in the race for the White House, was targeted in two assassination attempts, one in July and a second in September.
Many Hispanic voters in Texas’ historically blue Rio Grande Valley are fed up with Democratic Party rule and are looking to flip the area red Tuesday, locals told the Daily Caller.

The Valley, which borders northern Mexico and the Rio Grande River, is largely Hispanic. Many voters in the area are lifelong Democrats. Skyrocketing costs in one of the country’s poorest areas, a growing dissatisfaction with the Democratic party’s stance on culture war issues and a more energetic GOP, however, are all factors that may be pushing them across the aisle.

The five main counties that compose the Rio Grande Valley — Starr, Hidalgo, Willacy, Zapata and Cameron — all went heavily blue for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

But in 2020, Trump gained major ground in all five counties, even winning Zapata, the first time the county went red in 100 years, Zapata County Republican Chair Jennifer Thatcher told the Daily Caller.

“What they want is change,” Thatcher said of Zapata County voters. “Everybody’s tired of the same thing, you know, same empty promises and nothing getting done.”

In 2016, Clinton defeated Trump in Zapata, which is 94 percent Hispanic, with 65 percent of the vote to Trump’s 32 percent. But in 2020, Trump edged Biden 53-47, picking up 1,000 voters in the 12,000 person county.

That trend played out across the Rio Grande Valley. Trump picked up 69,493 votes across the five Valley counties from 2016 to 2020. Local Republicans believe he could make even bigger gains this time around.

“His support is just really remarkable,” Toni Trevino, Starr County’s Republican Chair, told the Daily Caller. It’s “off the charts, more so than in ‘16 and ‘20.”

While some voters in the border counties cited Trump’s immigration policies, it’s the economy and cost of living that seems to be by far the biggest reason for the shift.

“Things are getting very expensive,” Jorge Bazan, a Starr County voter who described himself as a “lifelong Democrat,” told the Caller. “To go to a restaurant, it’s expensive. Expensive groceries.”

Bazan, who works for a water company, says a foot of pipe used to cost his company $8 in 2020. Now, he says, it costs $21.

Prices overall have risen 20% since Jan ’21, according to the CPI, but many consumer staples are up 30% to 40% – or more: pic.twitter.com/n2Vx3g0EAx — E.J. Antoni, Ph.D. (@RealEJAntoni) October 12, 2024

This time, he says he’s voting for Trump. “The economy was better when he was in office.”

Many Starr County Democrats voted blue for their local candidates but revealed to Trevino that they also voted for Trump, she told the Caller.

Another local organizer, Col. Ross Barrera, heard the same thing. (RELATED: ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ | WATCH NOW)

“A lot of the people, they were hinting to me, ‘Mr. Barrera, we’re voting Democrat locally, but at the national level, Trump.’ These are people who barely speak English. They’re first generation Mexican-Americans,” he told the Caller.

Former Democrats told Barrera, Thatcher and Trevino they were voting Trump because they’re hurting financially.

Voters often mention prices for groceries and other staples. “The main issue for these people is, of course, bringing money home” Barrera said.

The Rio Grande valley is one of the poorest areas in the U.S. The area has a 27 percent family poverty rate, according to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. That number is well over double the national rate of 11.5 percent.

“To have there be such a tangible difference in the cost of living and in how much it costs us to feed and clothe our family and at the same time to have less job opportunities — or if we do have job opportunities, they’re lower-paying jobs — that is what I mean. People here, they saw the difference,” Trevino told the Caller.

“They saw the four years of Donald Trump, when their lives were better, and then they’ve seen the last four years when their lives have been not as good for their family.”

Despite the hardships, local Hispanic voters are not looking for handouts, Barrera said.

“The reason they come to America, not because they want abortions. They come because of jobs. These people, they want to work. They don’t want a giveaway. But the Democrats [say], “Oh, we’ll give you this. We’ll give you that. No, no, no, give me a job,” Barrera said.

While the economy appears to be the key catalyst in the valley’s rightward shift, other issues on the Democrat platform like the funding of foreign wars, border security, sex-changes for children and abortion (the area is heavily Catholic) are contributing to the party exodus as well.

For instance, Bazan mentioned abortion as a key issue for his rejection of Democrats, and county officials heard similar stories from others.

Still, the economy appears to be the main reason these voters are walking away.

“The economy, illegal immigration, inflation and oil, are the four key issues for voters in Starr County,” Barrera told the Caller. “Notice, I didn’t say anything about the transgender issue. Nothing about abortion. These are the issues that hit people hard. People want to work. They don’t want [the Democratic Party’s] ways.”

Flores illustrated her constituents’ opposition to Democrats by outlining their party platform.

“When the government leaves our border wide open, allowing 13,099 known murderers and 15,811 known [convicted sex offenders] into our country, people want a change. When the government advances legislation using tax dollars to pay for sex-changes for children, people want a change. When groceries become unaffordable and quality of life drops dramatically, people want a change. When we have crisis after crisis in our communities being ignored by our government while they’re sending hundreds of billions of dollars overseas, people want a change.”

The region has been reliably blue for decades. In 2020, The New York Times listed Texas as a toss-up, claiming Joe Biden could be the first Democrat to win the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976, citing “the arrival of a formidable multiracial Democratic coalition in the country’s largest red state.”

The outlet specifically cited the Hispanic vote and the Valley’s local Democratic candidates, who often run unopposed. That lack of opposition led to what former Republican Texas Rep. Mayra Flores called “single-party rule.”

“So many voters believe the only election of consequence is the primary election. Most voters, even those with conservative beliefs, vote in the Democrat primaries so they can have a say in who their locally-elected officials are,” Flores told the Caller. “It’s only recent that Republicans have been considered competitive in this area, and the investment in campaigning and outreach has been a priority.”

In the past it was frowned upon socially to not vote for Democrats, Barrera told the Caller.

“You couldn’t say you were a Republican because they would paint you as, ‘Oh, you want to be white. Oh, you wanna be rich. You’re in the wrong party.'” Barrera said.

But the tide is evidently turning. (RELATED: Caught On Camera: Dem Staffer Calls Americans Racist, Rants About Ending Border Patrol, Opening Borders)

In Barrera’s Starr County, Trump went from earning 19 percent of the vote in 2016 to 47 percent in 2020, narrowly losing to Biden despite picking up over 6,000 votes. Biden received 123 less votes in 2020 than Clinton did in 2016.

“I think it is almost certain that he will over-perform from 2020, and it is entirely possible that he sweeps the entire Rio Grande Valley,” Flores told the Caller.

The trend is playing out nationally too, as Trump is outperforming Kamala Harris with Hispanic male voters, according to an October AP/NORC poll.

Harris has struggled with Hispanic voters compared to her Democratic predecessors.

Hillary Clinton carried the Hispanic vote by 40 points and Biden did so by around 30. Harris led Trump by 12 points with registered Hispanic voters, according to an Economist/YouGov poll from late October.

Trevino and other party officials cited an uptick in the intensity and cohesion of their organizing efforts as part of why Trump has made these strides.

The area, which has one of the lowest turnout rates in the country, has experienced rapid growth in turnout in the last two presidential elections.

“Almost 12 percent of the early votes cast so far this year are from voters who have not voted in the last four elections,” Flores said. “The enthusiasm is high, but, at least in South Texas, seems to be one-sided.”

“Latino voters have been abandoned by the Democratic party. After decades of one-party rule, being taken for granted, and only seeing things get worse, they want a change.”
Michigan’s state university system was key to keeping the state blue in 2020. In 2024, with the polls showing Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump running neck-and-neck, turning out state schools’ student body to the polls has taken on a new level of urgency for Democrats.

Democrats have been furiously campaigning in the state, particularly on Michigan State University’s (MSU) campus just east of the state’s capital. Many are warning of the “dangers” of a second term under Republican presidential nominee and former president Donald Trump and pleading with students to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

Recent polling shows Trump closing in on Harris’ lead in Michigan, which has the power to shift the election. If Trump secures the battleground state of Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina, a win in Michigan is enough to put him back in the White House. (RELATED: Overwhelming Majority Of College Faculty Plan To Vote For Harris, Poll Shows)

“We know that Gen-Z has the power to keep Michigan blue,” Stella Camerlengo, communications director for the Michigan Federation of College Democrats, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We saw it in 2020 with young people having the largest turnout in Michigan, and we hope to see it again in 2024. Because the election is so close and we are in a swing state, we have flooded our campuses with Harris Campaign surrogates, voter registration efforts, and holding other events to make sure young people are voting blue this fall.”

Students have historically been one of the most reliable demographics for Democrats, however, increasing tensions on campus over the conflict in Gaza may be weakening their support for the party. Muslim Michiganders have already engaged in a concerted effort to deny Harris the vote.

“Given that Michigan had a 10k vote margin in 2016, then every little bit matters, including student turnout at the larger universities like MSU and UM,” Ken Kollman, a political science professor at the University of Michigan (UM), told the DCNF. “No one knows what will happen at this point, but neither campaign is taking chances. And given the more Democratic lean of educated younger voters, naturally the Harris campaign would feel a lot more comfortable with a strong turnout among college students.”

One of Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s campaign visits to MSU’s campus in support of Harris was tainted by anti-Israel students condemning the governor for allowing activists to be arrested during a demonstration in the spring at UM.

“11 of my friends have been arrested by Attorney General Dana Nessel,” Jesse Estrada White, a student at the university shouted, interrupting Whitmer’s speech, according to MSU’s student newspaper, The State News. “Gov. Whitmer, condemn the actions of your attorney general; protect the right to peacefully protest.”

The Democratic Party has struggled to resonate with student activists, creating a persistent issue with President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign that Harris may not have shaken off. Harris has attempted to toe the line on the Israel-Hamas issue, a strategy that has alienated both supporters of Israel and anti-Israel advocates.

Trump meanwhile scored the endorsement of the Hamtramck, Michigan Mayor Amer Ghalib in September, whose city is represented by an all-Muslim council.

Whitmer’s Oct. 17 visit was meant to mobilize student voters in the tight race as part of the Blue Wall Bus Tour alongside Govs. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Wes Moore of Maryland and Maura Healy of Massachusetts, according to the State News. The group spoke at the university’s student union building, warning that students held the fate of the election in their hands.

“It was college students in Maryland that made sure we won that race,” Moore said of his 2022 gubernatorial race, according to The State News. “It will be college students who will make sure that Kamala Harris becomes the next president of the United States.”

Registered voters under the age of 30 still overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump, 53% to 33%, according to a national Harvard poll conducted in October. Among registered voters aged 18-29 in battleground states, 50% plan to vote for Harris compared to 41% for Trump.

“We have the power,” Whitmer said, according to the State News. “The way we vote is going to determine everyone’s fate, not just in Michigan, not just in this country, but around the world.”

The national student voting rate was 66% for the 2020 presidential election, according to the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement. At Michigan’s two largest universities, UM with 33,488 undergraduate students and MSU with 40,483 undergraduate students as of 2023, the voter turnout rate in 2020 was 78.1% and 76.6%, respectively.

Ingham and Washtenaw counties — in which MSU and UM reside, respectively — were instrumental in carrying the vote for Biden in 2020, CNN’s election results show. Washtenaw voted 72.6% in favor of Biden, the highest of all counties in the state, and Ingham came out at 65.2%.

“I think Michigan is a tough place for national republicans to win and has been for some time,” Michael McKenna, president of MWR Strategies, told the DCNF. “That said, it seems like Mr. Trump is going to win the state, despite, or perhaps because of, Vice President Harris’s repeated trips. The tricky part about young voters is that it looks like young women, who are more likely to vote for vice president Harris, are also more likely to vote compared to young men.”

“It’s a challenge for Team Trump,” McKenna added.

In her third visit to MSU’s campus in October, Whitmer joined Curtis Hertel, a House candidate for Michigan’s 7th district, at a Tuesday rally where she petitioned the students for their votes, telling them “I just do what the young people tell me,” according to the State News.

“This generation is gonna live with the consequences of this election longer than any of the rest of us are,” Whitmer continued, according to the State News. “You get the biggest stake in the outcome of this election.”

Hertel then led students in a march towards the campus’ early voting center, telling them “Your future is on the ballot as we head into the polls,” according to the State News.

“Michigan, as a whole, the youth vote is massive just because we’re such a swing state,” Liam Richichi, president of the MSU College Democrats, said according to the State News. “We want to make sure we’re all getting out. Especially in the seventh congressional district and in mid-Michigan where we’re super competitive. We’re the heartbeat of the state.”

In another plea for the youth vote, Whitmer appeared at the university on Oct. 8 when she spoke to the College Democrats and visited her former sorority, according to The State News. There the governor bashed Trump and told students to vote for Harris for her support of gun control and climate change initiatives.

“It is going to be a close election, as hard as it is to believe when you look at the two candidates on the debate stage,” Whitmer told the crowd of 250, according to the State News. “When you see the man who has bumbled through his life and was born on third and thinks he’s going to triple, or the woman who worked her tail off to get where she is, it’s hard to believe it’s going to be close.”

“What happens on this campus matters,” she continued, emphasizing the Democrats’ need for voters aged 18 to 22, according to the State News.

Due to the liberal lean of college students on campus, MSU College Republicans have mainly focused their outreach efforts off campus, Zayne Bratschi, the club’s vice president told the DCNF.

“There’s more Democratic voters [on campus],” Bratschi said. “The Democratic voters there are more vocal, they’re easier to reach, so it makes it easier for Democratic campaigns to reach out to them and try to get to them, and Republicans and conservatives have more focused on the easier routes that we have like going to a nearby town and door knocking. So that’s kind of what I’ve been seeing, is [Democrats are] focusing on campus because their voters are easier to reach that way.”

Other high-profile Democrats have attempted to make similar appeals to the student base.

Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, spoke in East Lansing Sept. 13 just north of MSU’s campus. The vice presidential nominee warned the crowd of students and supporters that abortion was a pivotal issue this election and painted Harris’ debate against Trump in September as a success, according to The State News.

On Oct. 6, Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke to a crowd of about 800 on MSU’s campus, speaking mostly about climate change and student debt cancelation, according to the Lansing State journal.

“In the next four weeks, we have to work hard to see Kamala and Tim are elected,” Sanders said, according to the State Journal.

The 2024 election is shaping up to be a photo finish according to polling and voting data streaming in from a variety of places. Some people are making predictions one way or the other, suggesting they have insight on whether former President Donald Trump will pull off the greatest comeback in American political history or whether Vice President Kamala Harris will pull off an unprecedented victory after her late entrance into the race when her boss, President Joe Biden, dropped out.

It all comes down to who votes, which party turns out their people, and which theory of the case is right. I’m not going to make a prediction as I think those are useless. But I will do here is lay out what I think the landscape looks like and a compelling theory of the case explaining what I’ve been looking at in the final weeks and will be looking at in the final two days of this election. The answer to the question of which theory is correct we will find out on Tuesday night.

I’m inevitably asked by basically everybody in the lead-up to an election what I think will happen. People who work in the business, and people who just tune in in the final days, everyone who knows me knows this is not my first rodeo with presidential elections. I’ve covered many of them–this is my third one at Breitbart News, and it’s my fourth one working in the news business. I’ve also covered many more midterms, special elections, and off-year elections as well. And people know I obsess over data, from polls and voting patterns, trying to get ahead of the curve on demographic swings or changes that might be coming. My track record is pretty good, I’d argue, especially when it comes to seeing stuff others miss–most notably of course the 2016 election, but also key stuff in 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, and more. I’m also in constant contact with similar folks on both sides of the aisle trying to decipher headwinds, and talk to the various campaign and outside group folks and have a generally good idea of where to get reliable information and where to apply some healthy skepticism.

I don’t like happy talk from either side, and I try to make sense of what’s actually going to happen rather than providing a biased or slanted view. When election night comes and goes, of course, reality will set in no matter what–and someone has to win, and someone has to lose. The biggest question I always inevitably get after 2016 and 2020 both saw major polling industry misses is whether or not that’s going to happen again. There’s a lot of reason to believe it will, but we won’t know for sure until the votes are counted. So what I’m going to do here is something a little bit different than I normally do in news coverage. I’m going to lay the landscape as I see it now and what I expect and am looking for to figure out whose theory of the case is correct–and yes, as you’ve probably already noticed, I’m very much using first person here which is abnormal for me. Please, I beg readers and observers: Hold me to this case when the election is over. While I’m not making a prediction on who ultimately will win, I obviously want Trump to pull it off–I’ve said so publicly and even told the former president when I interviewed him in mid-October I was voting for him myself–and I can see a clear pathway for him to be able to do so. But there’s also a clear case to be made the other way, and yes I hate hedgers but that’s what I’m doing here–hedging, because while there are indeed lots of good signs for Trump that’s what they are: signs. Nobody knows exactly what will happen until it happens, and anyone who claims they can see the future is dead wrong: As far as I can tell, that superpower does not exist in humans at least not yet.

The Landscape on the Final Weekend:

First off, let’s lay out the status of the race as we open Sunday morning two days before election day. On Saturday night, the establishment media gushed over a poll from the Des Moines Register’s vaunted pollster Ann Selzer–she is revered by the political class, seen as an oracle of things to come–that showed Harris leading Trump in Iowa by 3 percent. This came after an Emerson College poll released earlier in the evening in Iowa showed Trump up double digits, and outperforming his 2020 victory margins over Biden there. So this presents us with an interesting question: Which one is right? Both things probably cannot be true except at the most extreme edges of the two surveys’ margins of error, as Nate Silver explained in a column late Saturday evening.

There are a lot of really, really smart people who know Iowa politics really well who think Selzer swung and missed bad:

Shortly after Selzer released her Iowa survey, AtlasIntel released a national poll and battleground state polls. Trump, the Atlas polls show, leads every single battleground state:

Atlas also had Trump up nationally:

Two wildly different worldviews right? While Atlas did not poll Iowa, if Selzer’s theory of the case is correct, there’s no way Atlas’s theory can be right–plenty of folks have rightly pointed out that if Trump has collapsed in Iowa then he probably is in trouble in neighboring Wisconsin too, not leading by more than a percent.

On Sunday morning, more polls came out. An Emerson College national survey shows a tied race nationally at 49 percent for Trump and for Harris:

In the electoral college, this would probably mean a Trump sweep across the battleground states or close to it. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by more than two and a half points but lost the electoral college–and in 2020 Biden won the national popular vote by more than four and a half points and barely won the electoral college. Those are not the only national polls out on Sunday morning. NBC News released one that shows Trump up a percent on Harris in the full field with third party candidates included while the two are tied head-to-head:

But then ABC News released one that shows Harris up 3 percent nationally in the full field:

Then there are New York Times polls from Sunday morning across the battleground states as well that paint an interesting and mixed picture of where things stand. The Times has Trump clearly up in Arizona, Harris barely up in North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nevada, and a tie ballgame in Pennsylvania and Michigan:

So how does that reconcile with AtlasIntel from the night before? Which one is right? We’ll find out on election night for sure, which is not far away. But interestingly, the New York Times’s Nate Cohn–one of the smartest data guys out there–writes a heck of a caveat in his piece releasing this data on Sunday morning suggesting he thinks it’s certainly possible perhaps even likely that the polls yet again underestimate Trump in a big way:

You can scour the polls over the past few weeks and find similar discrepancies from pollster to pollster, some of them wide and some of them minor but enough to make the difference. But the point is: How do you read this incoming data deluge and make sense of it all? As Silver’s headline on the Selzer poll release makes clear, “somebody is going to be wrong.” The question then that must be answered is: Who will be wrong and why? Well, the Trump team very much thinks the people who are going to be wrong will be the same folks across the political establishment–the media, the pundits, the pollsters, et cetera–who were wrong in both 2016 and 2020. And they have a lot of good reason to think so. But it’s also possible, sure, that things are wrong the other way. We’ll of course find out which case is correct and which one is not in a couple days. But here’s a big piece explaining the data that we do have in public at this point and why there’s a lot of reason to believe that Trump’s theory of the case is right yet again. For whatever it’s worth, his very future–in addition of course to the future of the nation and the world–depends on it. If he loses, the legal cases against him will accelerate next year–but if he wins the law-fare collapses. So there’s a lot on the line here.

Betting Market Jitters Rattle Final Days

Another place to look for signs–less scientific, and more based on the gut of the people with actual money on the line because they are literally betting on the outcome like sports bettors–is the betting markets. For the last few weeks, Trump had been clearly and convincingly the favorite in the betting markets. The three major ones to watch are Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt. Trump was a double digit or close to it favorite in all of them, and in most of the battleground states too. The markets have been rattled by things this weekend like the Selzer poll and in the lead-up to it clearly by an orchestrated leak from the Harris campaign’s senior-most adviser David Plouffe who claimed without evidence late last week that late-breaking undecided voters were going double digits for Harris. There’s really no reason to believe that’s true at least not to that extent, but the betting markets tend to be jittery especially when big “whales” make massive bets.

The markets have been remarkably consistent until this final weekend, though:

Some whales have been making huge bets throughout the election:

And there is wild movement in some of the key states in the final days:

The betting markets are not and really have never been the best indicators of outcomes; they do occasionally show at least some perceived movement for one candidate or against another. But in terms of predictive value, they really do not suggest much. The most extreme swings I can remember in betting markets were in the 2022 Pennsylvania GOP U.S. Senate primary, where polling showed Dr. Mehmet Oz way out front and businessman David McCormick in distant second or perhaps even third place. McCormick was way down going into the election in the betting markets, but when the results started rolling in showing a very close race he shot up to mega favorite somewhere near 90 percent, but then McCormick ended up losing a very close race to Oz by about a thousand votes. The reason I bring that up is because betting markets tend to be very jittery around election time and even as results pour in, and they do not tend to be particularly predictive of outcome–they tend to track with where conventional wisdom is going, not where the results actually go.

Models, Models, Models: Poll Aggregators Try to Decipher Big Picture

In addition to the actual polls and the betting markets, another thing to keep an eye on is the predictions of the various modelers–and yes, just like pollsters, there are many of them. What modelers do is take the aggregates of polling data and try to apply a formula to it to make sense of what might happen.

There are various levels of sophistication in modeling. Some are just polling averages. Others are complicated formulas that apply differing levels of weighting to the publicly available data. The most well-known modeler, and probably the most accurate modeler, is Nate Silver. He used to run FiveThirtyEight before he went off on his own and made his own new model (FiveThirtyEight is still active and is now owned by ABC, and runs its own models too). Then there’s the Economist magazine, and then there is RealClearPolitics.

Silver’s latest model prediction as of Sunday morning is that Trump has a 51.5 percent chance of winning the election, and Harris has a 48.1 percent chance of winning. A tie, or nobody with a majority, gets a 0.4 percent shot in Silver’s analysis (how fitting that would be as an end to this wild election cycle that the two candidates would get 269-269 and the U.S. House would have to decide?). As Silver keeps warning his readers, this is a genuine toss-up if the polls are right–but he also has said in other pieces that it’s certainly possible that the polls are wrong and they might be wrong in a way favoring Trump. But they also could be wrong in a way that favors Harris. Who knows? It’s honestly why we can’t call the election right now because we genuinely do not know how this will break.

Now, if you read Silver’s modeling in a different way like Eric Daugherty does here, it’s possible you could give Trump an even bigger edge in that if you apply his national polling average to his expectations of the electoral college bias favoring Trump, you would get a near certainty that Trump would win:

The latest FiveThirtyEight model is actually kinder to Trump than Silver is as of Sunday (throughout the election Silver’s new model has usually been kinder to Trump than his old outfit):

The Economist model, meanwhile, expects a razor thin outcome that favors Harris:

Meanwhile, RealClearPolitics’s polling averages in the battleground states have Trump leading North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, while Harris leads Michigan and Wisconsin. All of these leads for both sides are miniscule, and none of them are clear and convincing.

Which one of these models or estimates is right, if any of them? Are they all wrong? We’ll find out in two days.

The Analysts: People Who Know What They’re Talking About Weigh In

As far as elections go, every time around you’ll see a bunch of analysts and people who purport to be able to read the tea leaves weighing in on what they think will happen. The most notorious of these is a man named Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University who developed a system decades ago that applies a series of “keys” that have nothing to do with data but with the nature of the nation and the electorate to make a prediction about who will win. Lichtman claims to have gotten all but one of the last several elections right–his prediction in 2000 was Democrat Al Gore would win, and he still clings to hanging chads in Florida to claim he was right after all even though Republican George W. Bush won that election–but there are very well-documented problems with Lichtman’s history and predictions.

Lichtman has formally predicted that Harris, the Democrat, will win this election. He might be right in the end, or he might be wrong, and if he’s right he’ll claim the high ground and if he’s wrong his system will be shredded by critics.

But beyond the panache and flashy nature of Lichtman’s tea-leaves-reading, there are other far more credible analysts who regularly weigh in in the lead-up to an election. Probably the best among the analysts out there is a man named Sean Trende with RealClearPolitics. He did an interview recently with New York Magazine in which he explained he thinks Trump has the edge going into the election, more so than Harris–though he certainly is not yet calling the race or anything like that. Trende told the magazine that “if you look at the bigger picture and everything else surrounding the race — I think to the extent we’re going to rely on vibes, they’re better for Trump.”

“I think Trump’s had a couple rough news cycles since then, but I still think, on balance, once you get past the polls — which, again, point to a very close race — the way I might put it is I’d rather be playing his hand than hers,” Trende said.

To summarize Trende’s argument, there are a few major reasons why he thinks Trump has the edge in the home stretch. The first is the behavior of the campaigns. Put simply, with some exceptions: Trende thinks Trump is acting like a winner, and Harris is acting like a loser. There’s a lot of reason to think that’s true, and even though it kind of blew up on him after the fact the mere fact Trump did his Madison Square Garden rally in the first place is something Trende thinks is the act of a winner not a loser on the GOP side.

But more importantly that that stuff, Trende argues, is some of the trends that are apparent in the substantial amounts of early voting data streaming in from across the country now especially from the battleground states. Trende argues that the early voting data that suggests what the election day “overall numbers” will look like are “really bad for Democrats” as nationally speaking “it really does look like minority turnout is down.” He’s right about that, and we’ll get into it in the next section in an in-depth way. But it’s also worth highlighting another thing that Trende said about Trump in that interview, which is he said: “I do think you have to give some weight to the possibility that the pollsters are going to underestimate him.”

So, if that happens again like it did in 2016 and 2020, depending on how eccentric such an error would be in the polling, it would ultimately suggest a blowout victory for Trump would loom in the electoral college–and all this talk of this being a super “close” election will have been just plain wrong. Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? Perhaps. Will it definitely happen? We’ll see on Tuesday.

Cohn from the Times, another analyst worth closely watching, had a similarly fascinating piece this weekend headlined: “Why Are Democrats Having Such a Hard Time Beating Trump?”

In the article, Cohn lays out the case that the issue set has swung hard against Democrats and liberalism more broadly this cycle than any recent election including 2016.

“How is Mr. Trump still so competitive? The simplest answer is that the national political environment just isn’t as conducive to a Democratic victory as many might imagine,” Cohn writes. “Democrats clearly face headwinds in this election. In the last New York Times/Siena College poll, only 40 percent of voters approved of President Biden’s performance, and only 28 percent said the country was heading in the right direction. No party has retained control of the White House when so many Americans were dissatisfied with the country or the president.”

But it’s “even deeper” than that, Cohn continues, by explaining this fits a “broader” trend worldwide that seems to benefitting Republicans this cycle. “For the first time in decades, Republicans have pulled even or ahead in nationwide party identification. Polls also find Republicans with an edge on most key issues — with democracy and abortion standing as significant exceptions,” Cohn writes. “The Democrats’ challenge appears to be part of a broader trend of political struggles for ruling parties across the developed world. Voters appear eager for change when they get the chance.”

There are other analysts out there worth reading too, and I’m in no way saying these two are the only ones worth watching–but Trende’s and Cohn’s analyses usually tend to pinpoint where things are going. One other one I would highlight is CNN’s Harry Enten, who tends to have a sober look at things throughout most election cycles. Some recent segments from him on television explaining things I would point to are this one saying if Trump wins the signs were there all along:

But he also did a similar segment on if Harris wins:

And any polling error either way could massively swing this election one way or the other:

Another one I watch closely is Mark Halperin. While the establishment media tried to cancel him, he is deeply sourced on all sides. He talks to Democrats and to Republicans and to top analysts across the board. On Sunday, he is set to interview Ann Selzer–the Des Moines Register pollster–about her findings. But the other night he dropped an interesting bombshell on the country, reporting that strategists from both parties were telling him that Harris is slipping badly in Wisconsin:

If his report here is true, and that’s a big if, then Harris is in very big trouble indeed. Again, we’ll see.

The Early Vote Data: Careful What You Read Into But Some Signs of GOP Strength

Overall, reading early vote data can be tantalizingly interesting and entirely meaningless at the same time. Or it can hint what might happen. You need to know how to read the roadmap and signposts, and you have to be careful that you don’t draw too many conclusions from it.

Each state is a bit different from others in terms of what levels and types of early voting they have, in terms of what information they release publicly and how they release it, and in terms of what you can actually glean from it. I always tell people the two best states you can read into things from if you know how to read the data are North Carolina and Nevada. This is because both states have heavy percentages of early voting, and both states release partisan breakdowns of the numbers–and North Carolina gives out demographic data too.

Let’s start with North Carolina. In-person early voting in North Carolina ended on Saturday, and now it’s all down to election day turnout for each side. Combined with absentee/mail numbers in the state, a total of more than 4.4 million ballots have been cast in North Carolina, nearly 57 percent of voters expected voters. The state could be heading for record turnout after election day comes and goes if between 1.5 and 1.6 million voters–not unrealistic–vote on Tuesday, which would break the 2020 turnout record of just north of 75 percent and set final turnout around 76 to 77 percent.

At the end of early voting in North Carolina, Democrats came in third–which is unprecedented, they usually win–to unaffiliated voters, who came in first, and Republicans, who came in second. Mike Rusher, a GOP strategist in North Carolina who closely tracks the early voting in the state, tweeted the final updates on Sunday morning:

Mathematically speaking, Republicans finished better than they ever have in early voting this time–and Democrats are pretty far down as compared with what they usually do. Basically, the gist of things is Democrats are down hundreds of thousands of votes compared to 2020, and Republicans up big time and so are unaffiliated voters. For Harris to really turn things around in North Carolina, she will probably need to win unaffiliated voters by close to or even possibly well into double digits depending on turnout on election day and how partisans break when it comes to their party’s candidate. That’s pretty unlikely given the historical trend of most such voters almost evenly splitting, and it seems to be a very uphill battle for her there. That’s part of why many insiders think she withdrew millions in planned campaign spending on television ads from North Carolina in the final days.

Moving out west to Nevada, things are looking rosy for Trump and Republicans but it’s not over yet. Jon Ralston of the Nevada Independent, who closely tracks the early voting data, details as of Sunday morning that the Republicans have built a substantial firewall there:

Democrats have yet to really cut into it, but still could in the lead-up and after election day. It remains to be seen, but basically Harris would need a massive showing with independents if the Republicans hold firm above 30,000 votes. They’re currently above 40,000 in the lead. So we’ll see, and obviously we’ll be watching Ralston closely in the final days.

JMC Analytics, a firm that tracks such data as well around the country, noticed a drop off in black voter turnout among early voting. If this continues through election day, there are major problems for Harris.

“In states that track the race of a voter (for example, Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina), black voting intensity is noticeably less compared to 2020– to use one example, as of last night in Louisiana, 25.5% of early voters were black, compared to 30% in 2020 (blacks make up 31% of registered voters in the state),” JMC Analytics’ piece on Sunday morning noted. “A similar dynamic is happening in Georgia and North Carolina – Kamala Harris absolutely needs a robust black turnout if she wants to hold Georgia and/or flip North Carolina.”

JMC Analytics is not the only place that noticed this trend, and it’s something that seems to be transcending across the battleground states. Sure, it’s profound in North Carolina importantly:

But perhaps it’s even worse for Democrats per some data in Pennsylvania:

And it seems to be a trend that’s holding nationally and across battleground states, which if true would spell doom for Harris. So, we’ll see–again, the common refrain I keep coming back to because we really don’t know for sure–if it holds going into Tuesday. Patrick Ruffini, the pollster with Echelon Insights, says this seems to be a trend cutting across the battleground states though.

Electoral College Paths For Each Candidate

Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have clear pathways to victory in the electoral college. For Trump, his easiest pathway is on the east coast. Let’s start from the reading of things that we had before the Iowa poll discrepancies this weekend. Trump would start with all the red states and Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Maine’s second district with 219 electoral votes.

Assuming that’s right, and basically everyone thinks it is, he needs to just win Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania and that would put him at exactly 270 electoral votes. If he falters in Pennsylvania, he’ll need Arizona or Nevada plus Michigan–or he’ll need Arizona plus Wisconsin.

As for Harris, if she cuts into the so-called sun belt states–most everyone is beginning to think the early vote in those places suggests they are out of reach for her though–Trump’s path becomes very difficult. But Harris’s easiest path is and always has been hold all three upper rust belt states. If she wins Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, it’s very hard for Trump to defeat her as Trump would need to flip Nebraska’s second district to tie her or add another state like a New Mexico or New Hampshire or Virginia–all of which are less likely to break his way if the upper rust belt goes her way.

The Bottom Line: Nobody Knows

I could keep writing and putting more and more data and information into this piece for eternity. There’s lots of other stuff in different other places, including lots of mixed signals on gender breakdowns in early voting and polling particularly which I didn’t really address here, but at a certain point again the election is coming and we’ll know soon enough. The big picture though here is there is a lot of data to suggest that Trump can and maybe will pull this off–and there is a lot of data to suggest it maybe just maybe breaks the other way. We’ll see soon enough on Tuesday. Make sure you vote no matter where you live, and make your voice heard. It’s one of those elections that might just come down to a handful of votes one way or the other, or it could be a landslide one way or the other.
The Brief In Milwaukee, early voters continued to wait in line to cast in-person absentee ballots on Saturday. Across the state, more than one million people have already done so. The last day to vote early in-person absentee is Sunday. The election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.



In Wisconsin, more than one million people have already cast their ballot – and the early-voting trend continued in Milwaukee on Saturday.

Sunday is the last day to vote early. And whether casting a ballot then or on Election Day, the Milwaukee Election Commission asks people to be patient.

"You get here on Tuesday and the line is going around the block five times," said voter Carla Jefferson.

"Get it done, get it in early, there is no telling how long the lines are going to look like Election Day," voter Kiara Perry said.

Jefferson told FOX6 News she thought the process would be easier in the city of Milwaukee during early voting on Saturday.

"I thought that I was avoiding a line, but as you see, I have not," she said.

The city election commission said the long lines are tied to high turnout.

"Took about an hour to get in and out, and they were really nice and efficient," said voter Sharie Garcia. "I have only been a citizen since 2020, so this is my second time voting in a presidential election."

"Makes it real worthwhile to stand out here in the cold," said Greg Garcia, Sharie's son, who is voting in a presidential election for the first time.

Early voting line in Milwaukee on Saturday, Nov. 2.

Based on this year's trends, the Milwaukee Election Commission said it expects more than 100,000 ballots by Election Day. Across the state, more than 1.3 million ballots have already been cast.

"As early voting has become more and more of a thing, more popular I guess, I jumped on that bandwagon," said voter Michelle Shikoski.

"We can’t just sit on the fence and say, somebody else needs to, we just need to take that step and do it ourselves," Jefferson said.

Five polling places will remain open in Milwaukee on Sunday. Otherwise, prospective voters can still register and vote in person on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Information on times and locations is available on the city's website.

Forward Latino breakfast

National nonprofit group Forward Latino on Saturday held an "Early Voting Breakfast" on the city's south side.

The public was encouraged to discuss the importance of early voting and grab some grub outside El Rey Family Market near 51st and Oklahoma before heading across the street to cast in-person absentee ballots at Serb Hall.

Early voting at Serb Hall on Saturday, Nov. 2.

"Our voice is our vote. You can't complain about how things are going if you don't participate in the system," said Darryl Morin, Forward Latino national president. "What's great about our democracy is everybody's vote counts the same, so we want everyone to come on out, celebrate democracy and vote with us."

The event was hosted in partnership with other community organizations. It ran from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m.

‘Dialogue Across Difference’

With the Nov. 5 election now three days away, community members from across southeast Wisconsin gathered at Marquette University for "Dialogue Across Difference for a Safe Election Season."

Two facilitators introduced a model for constructive dialogue called "the ABCs." The event aimed to explore different views on "strengthening our democratic republic, including our election processes."

"Dialogue Across Difference for a Safe Election Season"

"Be mindful that after the results are known that they are going to hit people different ways," said Joe Bubman, executive director of Urban Rural Action. "Recognize that the way you feel might not be the way other people feel."

Urban Rural Action organized the free, interactive event with funding from a U.S. Department of Homeland Security grant.
Voters could strike a major blow to outgoing Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s climate legacy if two ballot initiatives that repeal legislation restricting the use of natural gas and taxing companies’ carbon emissions pass on Nov. 5.

Washington state residents are set to vote on two energy-related ballot initiatives, with one rolling back a law that restricts natural gas usage (I-2066) and the other repealing the state’s carbon trading system (I-2117), which supporters have labeled a “hidden gas tax.” Proponents believe that passage of these initiatives will send a clear message to Washington’s Democratic trifecta that residents are not content to pay higher gas prices than the majority of the nation in the name of climate change. (RELATED: Blue State Is Imposing A New Climate Policy And Gas Prices Are Already Skyrocketing)

“Our radical green energy policies have been put in place by a vocal, pampered minority of activists whose opinions are not widely held and shared,” Jim Walsh, chairman of the Washington GOP and author of the carbon trading system repeal initiative, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “They are an unsympathetic interest group.”

Inslee has called the referendums “the single most important election other than the White House in the United States.”

Voters appear likely to pass the natural gas ban prohibition initiative, with 44% of registered voters in support and 31% opposed, according to the most recent poll from SurveyUSA conducted between Oct. 9 and 14. State residents appear less eager to back the carbon trading system repeal, with 48% saying they will reject the initiative and 30% in favor. However, 25% remain undecided about the natural gas ban prohibition measure (I-2066) and 22% for the carbon trading system repeal initiative (I-2117).

Walsh told the DCNF that he expects both ballot initiatives to pass while conceding that the natural gas ban prohibition initiative has more support because the measure is ultimately about defending “consumer choice.”

“People like cooking with natural gas, and even if they don’t have it in their home or their apartment, they don’t like the idea of being told that they couldn’t have it,” Walsh told the DCNF.

“We are confident in 2117 [the carbon trading system repeal] and 2066 [the natural gas ban prohibition] passing because we have been on the ground talking to voters for the last six months and they say the same thing: prices are too high,” Hallie Balch, spokesperson for Let’s Go Washington, the political committee led by Brian Heywood that financed the push to get these initiatives on voters’ ballots, told the DCNF.

Both petitions collected more signatures than any initiative filed in Washington state during the past two decades. The natural gas ban prohibition measure received more than 514,000 signatures — the second most in state history — and the carbon trading system repeal petition collected more than 466,000, which was the fourth most.

Walsh told the DCNF that nearly 60% of signatures came from independents and registered Democrats, and that he expects voters who cast ballots for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris to also vote in support of these initiatives.

Let’s Go Washington and Walsh attribute cost-of-living concerns as the primary reason these two initiatives have garnered significant support among Washington residents.

Average gas prices in Washington today are the third highest in the nation at around $4.04 a gallon, nearly a dollar more than the $3.13 a gallon national average. The Association of Washington Business (AWB) in January projected that Washington’s carbon market trading program is responsible for a 45 cent increase in gas prices since becoming operational in January 2023.

“I’m willing to make a wager with you,” Heywood said during a debate on the carbon trading system repeal at Seattle University on Oct. 10. “If 2117 [the carbon trading system repeal] passes, the price of gas relative to other states will go down because we’re putting a 25 to 50% tax on it.”

If I-2117 fails, Heywood predicts gas prices will keep rising as the carbon trading system’s carbon price increases. “It’s designed for the price to go up,” Heywood added.

“I-2117 [the carbon trading system repeal] will lower costs by taking 30-50 cents off every gallon of gas, and I-2066 [the natural gas ban prohibition] will reduce costs for homeowners and buyers by removing some of the most restrictive building codes in the nation and not requiring people to retrofit their homes to electric for tens of thousands of dollars,” Balch told the DCNF.

The carbon trading system repeal is notably opposed by Amazon, BP America, Microsoft, the Environmental Defense Fund and more than 500 other entities. Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer are among the top donors to the No On 2117 Committee, doling out $1 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Let’s Go Washington told the DCNF that more than $40 million in total has been spent against the carbon trading system repeal measure and other initiatives.

Opponents of I-2117 have claimed that repeal of the state’s carbon trading system would lead to substantial cuts to the state’s transportation and infrastructure budget, funded in part through government revenue raised from taxing companies’ carbon emissions.

“It would gut programs that protect communities from wildfires, jeopardize vital protections for our waterways, including rivers, lakes and streams, and eliminate efforts to support salmon recovery and fish habitat,” Kelsey Nyland, a spokesperson for the No On 2117 campaign, told the DCNF. “And by forcing $5.4 billion in cuts to our state’s transportation funding, it would hurt every corner of our state, putting major road and bridge projects addressing congestion, safety and freight mobility at risk of being delayed or even canceled.”

Supporters of the carbon trading system repeal have not offered an alternative source of government revenue that could continue paying for these projects.

“It will be up to the legislature to negotiate a better budget in the upcoming legislative session,” Walsh, also a state Republican lawmaker, told the DCNF. “If we adjust and we negotiate better budgets, then there will be no negative effects. And even the projected effects would be either less or zero if we negotiate a better operating budget in the upcoming budget negotiations, which is entirely possible.”

Heywood has also criticized the state government for implementing no accountability mechanisms that measure the projected climate impacts of projects the government is funding through revenue raised from the carbon trading system.

“They do not have a way to measure the results of any of the money that they’re spending,” Heywood said during the Seattle University debate. “It’s all fake promises with money that they can then go around and pay their political constituents.”

“This is a huge grift,” Heywood added. (RELATED: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee Unveils Near Billion Dollar Plan To Steer Tax Dollars To Green Energy Industry)

Walsh told the DCNF that there could have been even more initiatives on Washington residents’ ballots this election, but that the Washington legislature passed the most popular measures during this year’s legislative session.

“They were afraid if all six appeared on the ballot now, there would be an overwhelming red wave of voters,” Walsh said to the DCNF. “As a turnout mechanism, they’re very powerful.”

Washington Democrats have raised the possibility of taking up a constitutional amendment to curtail or fully eliminate the ballot initiative process that allows voters to have direct say over policies impacting their livelihoods, according to Walsh.

“They’ve lost the people’s support, and what they want to do now is try to get rid of initiatives,” Walsh told the DCNF. “They have no sense of how anti-democratic or arrogant their position is.”

Presidential campaigns are first and foremost about messaging. In any race, the campaigns and the media push the importance of certain ideas or moments in the hopes that they will saturate the public consciousness. But out of hundreds of attempts at this, only a handful succeed.

In 2024, during my travels to over two dozen towns and cities, there were five moments that stand out for capturing the imagination of the electorate, and shaping voting preferences of Americans. Each changed the narrative of the race and carved out a new direction for it.

No matter who wins, these are the stories that got us here.

The Butler Assassination Attempt

In an echo of the original shot heard round the world, Donald Trump’s near miss in Butler, Pennsylvania, that left a defiant former president shot, bleeding and pumping his fist to the crowd is the most iconic moment of this election. For Trump supporters, the shooting reinforced what they already felt about him: that he was strong, courageous, and maybe even a bit obstinate.

For independents and even some Democrats I spoke with, Trump’s brush with death sent a clear signal that it was time for the dangerous rhetoric of calling him "Hitler" to stop, and for a while, it did. But not for long.

Also, at that moment, many people, including two ship workers I spoke with in Toledo, Ohio, thought the race was over. One of them looked at the TV, then at me, and said, "That’s it, he’s gonna win." And that brings us directly to our second moment.

Biden’s Timing Dropping Out

Easily the most important, historic and consequential event in the 2024 race was President Joe Biden’s decision to exit the contest. And it wasn’t just the choice, it was very much the timing.

Nobody knows what role the attempt on Trump's life played in Biden’s decision, but for weeks before, he and his allies insisted he wasn’t going anywhere despite his bizarre and troubling debate performance against Trump. It was only after the shooting, and a triumphant Republican National Convention that celebrated Trump’s survival, that the pressure on Biden became too much to bear.

Had Biden chosen to drop out in March, Kamala Harris may or may not have won a contested Democratic primary, but she would have had to go through that gauntlet, answering questions and doing interviews. Biden left no time for that.

The comment I heard most commonly from voters on the ground, especially after she disavowed a dozen of her previous progressive positions, was "I just don’t know who she is." But that was going to change.

Harris Starts Doing Interviews

In late August, after weeks of running a ‘Hidin’ Harris’ 2024 campaign in which she refused to do any interviews, the vice president finally sat down for a friendly exchange with NBC News’ Lester Holt, bringing her running mate Tim Walz along. It did not go well. Trying to address her flip-flopping, she said, "My values have not changed," which did not answer the question.

It got worse weeks later when Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier grilled the veep, who at one point, exasperated, said to the newsman, "You and I both know what I’m talking about," to which Baier, speaking for millions of Americans, replied, "I actually don’t. What are you talking about?"

After that, the most common comment I heard from voters was no longer, "I don’t know who she is," but, "Why can’t she answer any questions?" I even heard this from union guys stumping for Harris in Pennsylvania. If she loses, this will likely be why.

Springfield, Ohio

"They’re eating the cats, They’re eating dogs," Trump said at the presidential debate, to howling accusations of racism from Democrats and the media who argued Trump was endangering the 15,000 Haitian migrants in Springfield, a city of a mere 60,000 residents.

It was classic Trump. First he made the story about himself, picking up on running mate JD Vance’s suggestion that pets were becoming meat, but then, when the dust settled, the story became Springfield itself, and the obvious mismanagement of the migrant asylum program there, which had previously been ignored.

In Springfield, I heard from grateful citizens who were finally being listened to, and it resonated more broadly. One woman in Bedford, Pa., told me, "I don’t care about the cats and dogs, but I am worried about 10,000 migrants being dropped on our doorstep."

The Teamsters Snub

When the Teamsters refused to endorse Harris for president in late September, it was actually two bombshells in one. First, was the snub itself, and then internal polling that showed Biden had been beating Trump by double digits, but Trump was beating Harris by double digits.

This was an earthquake for Democrats who rely heavily on not just the votes of private sector union members, but their organization. In Washington, Pa., around that time, I met a former Teamsters official whose disdain for Harris was so vivid and audible that a waiter had to tell us to quiet down.

This was the first major chink in Harris’ armor. From that point on, the joy and optimism that had permeated her campaign turned into a darker, more fearful message that culminated in words like "Hitler" and "fascist" making their dangerous return to the trail.

Over the coming days or weeks we will know the outcome of this election, but whatever it is, it will have been shaped by unexpected moments that shook the campaign and seized the attention of America’s voters.

Politics can bring the horse of voter interest to water, but can’t make voters drink. These five events did make them drink. And for one side or the other, a bad hangover is soon on its way.
Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz called former President Trump a "dictator" who wants to "overturn the Constitution" during his final pitch to voters in the battleground state of Arizona.

Speaking in Tucson, Walz said, "Momentum is on our side, but we take nothing for granted" and "We know in Arizona a vote or two per precinct could be what it takes to win the whole damn race for the country."

"Someday you're going to be sitting on that porch. You're going to be in that rocking chair, and a little one is going to come up to you after being in school where they've been studying the 2024 election, and they're going to ask when everything was on the line and the American experiment was on the line, and there was somebody running who asked to be a dictator and to overturn the Constitution and talk about using the military against our own people. What did you do to stop that from happening?" Walz told the crowd on Saturday.

"And you're going to be able to say every damn thing we could, every damn thing we could," he said.

SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE TAKES AIM AT ‘COACH’ TIM WALZ OVER SPORTS TERMINOLOGY

Walz closed his speech by saying: "Make a plan to vote. Make a plan to get out and canvass. Make a plan to take a neighbor to the polls."

Arizona is a state that leans Republican in the presidential race, according to the final Fox News Power Rankings forecast before the election.

KAMALA HARRIS APPEARS ON ‘SNL’ IN FINAL EPISODE BEFORE ELECTION

In eight high-quality polls conducted in Arizona since August, Trump has been ahead in seven. His edge has been between 1-6 points.

Immigration continues to be a highly important issue in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico.

In the latest Wall Street Journal survey, 25% of voters said immigration was the most important issue to their vote, higher than any other battleground. It was a "deal-breaker" issue for 24% of voters. And Arizona voters preferred Trump on the issue by 10 points.

Fox News’ Remy Numa contributed to this report.
The New York Times and the leftist outfit Media Matters dropped complementary hit pieces Thursday, accusing BlazeTV hosts Steve Deace, Mark Levin, and Jason Whitlock — along with various other prominent voices in conservative media, including Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, and Lara Trump — of "election misinformation."

The apparent aim of this coordinated attack, which the Washington Post did its part to reinforce, is to pressure the Google-owned platform YouTube to demonetize or possibly even deplatform Democrats' ideological opponents before Election Day.

"Being lumped in with those fine fellows, and being labeled an enemy number one from the official Pravda of the regime, is truly the greatest honor of my career," Deace told Blaze News.

'It defines "false claims" and "election misinformation" so broadly.'

Times reporter Nico Grant gave the plot away in advance when asking Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro, and Mike Davis of the Article III Project on Monday about their respective memberships in the YouTube Partner Program, their track records of demonetization, and history of notes from YouTube regarding "misinformation."

Grant, whom Carlson told to "f*** off," indicated that Media Matters, a leftist organization founded by Democratic operative David Brock that is presently being sued by Elon Musk for alleged defamation, identified "286 YouTube videos between May and August that contained election misinformation, including narratives that have been debunked or are not supported with credible evidence."

Blaze News previously reached out to the Times and Media Matters for a working definition of "misinformation" but did not receive a response from either outfit. As a result, it remains unclear whether the Times' false or misleading reports about Russian collusion, former Covington Catholic student Nicholas Sandmann, the death of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, and jihadists' missile misfire at a Gazan hospital would qualify.

Journalists Matt Taibbi and Paul D. Thacker wrote Friday on the "Racket News" Substack, "The problem with the Times piece is it defines 'false claims' and 'election misinformation' so broadly that legitimate questions or analyses and even jokes get wrapped in with far-out conspiracy tales."

Media Matters did, however, shine some light on what sort of claims it apparently feels should not be uttered on YouTube, namely: suggestions "that the election process is 'rigged' against Trump, that the legal cases against him constitute 'election interference,' that Democrats want and are enabling noncitizens to vote in order to win the election, and that Kamala Harris was 'illegally installed' as the Democratic nominee in a 'coup' against Joe Biden."

If Media Matters gets its way, then YouTube might penalize critics for highlighting the unmistakable efforts by Democrats to throw Trump in prison before the election and to remove him from the ballot; Democratic lawmakers' publicly stated plans to invalidate a lawful Trump victory; the Biden-Harris Department of Justice's lawsuits aimed at restoring the voter registration of thousands of suspected foreign nationals; or for questioning the nature of Biden's ouster as Democratic candidate and Harris' voteless candidacy.

Media Matters specifically complained that BlazeTV host Mark Levin said in May that Democrats "will do anything for votes — imprison Trump, steal elections," and that Democrats would "change the electoral process" to get more votes.

The Democratic attack dog attacked Levin further for apparently suggesting in July that Democrats "stole the election from their own primary voters and they're going to install somebody who hasn't gotten a single delegate on her own."

Media Matters also set its sights on Deace, complaining:

Right-wing radio host Steve Deace said Democrats would be "dropping ballots" and "bussing people in … to keep the spigot going until they get what they want" on Election Day. Deace continued, "All they’re trying to do is make her credible enough so they can fortify this thing at the end here."

Media Matters was apparently distressed to learn that Deace could exercise his First Amendment rights and suggest on YouTube that Democrats might want to get the polls "within their narrative margin to justify cheating."

The hit piece also noted that BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock accused California of "manipulat[ing] voting."

A YouTube spokeswoman told the Times that the company reviewed eight videos identified by the liberal paper and found that none of them violated its community guidelines. However, that's not what the Times originally reported.

'But what they meant for evil, I will choose to use for good.'

"A YouTube spokeswoman said none of the 286 videos violated its community guidelines," wrote Grant.

The Times has since issued a correction:

An earlier version of this article misstated the number of videos that YouTube reviewed when asked for comment on whether they contained misinformation. YouTube said it reviewed eight videos, which were identified by The New York Times and referenced in the article, not all of them, and found that those eight did not violate its community guidelines; it did not comment on whether they contained misinformation.

The YouTube spokeswoman whose response was initially misrepresented by the Times apparently also told Grant, "The ability to openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial, is an important value — especially in the midst of election season."

Evidently not all are keen on open debate and free speech.

Kayla Gogarty, an LGBT activist who interned at the Human Rights Campaign before becoming "research director" at Media Matters, said, "YouTube is allowing these right-wing accounts and channels to undermine the 2024 results."

Media Matters was not entirely impotent regarding its censorious crusade. The Times indicated that YouTube censored three videos and placed "information labels" that link to supposedly factual information on 21 other videos.

Deace told Blaze News, "The timing of this hit piece is obviously to induce Google, which also owns YouTube and thus the two largest search engines on this planet, to censor those of us who are among the most effective in deconstructing the Left's attempts to deconstruct America right before the election. But what they meant for evil, I will choose to use for good."

Taibbi and Thacker summarized the attack campaign thusly:

A DNC-aligned group produces a "report" documenting a sciencey-sounding quantity of "misinformation" incidents, then passes the scary number to a politically willing mainstream news outlet, which trumpets the new "facts" while publicly and privately pressuring platforms to remove offending material. Welcome to the new "accountability journalism."

The New York Times, a far-left propaganda outlet that spreads conspiracy theories and violence, launched a McCarthyite attack on popular conservative podcasters to bully YouTube into blacklisting them.

I’ll start with the specifics, but then I’ll lay out what’s really happening here…

“Election Falshoods Take Off on YouTube as It Looks the Other Way,” reads the Halloween Day headline. And what follows is nothing short of a WokeQueda attack on YouTube to pressure the outlet into silencing and removing — not false content — but opinions and ideas the Times does not want heard or debated [I don’t link to fascism]:

In June 2023, YouTube decided to stop fighting the most persistent strain of election misinformation in the United States: the falsehood that President Biden stole the 2020 election from Donald J. Trump. Within months, the largest video platform became a home for election conspiracy theories, half-truths and lies. They in turn became a source of revenue for YouTube, which announced growing quarterly ad sales on Tuesday.

Guess who the Times decided to use as its source? You’re gonna think I’m making this up, but I’m not:

Media Matters, a group the Times describes as one that tracks what “conservative sources” are saying and writing.

Media Matters!

The proven, far-left, taxpayer-subsidized, serial lying Brownshirts at Media Matters.

What, was NewsGuard too busy drop-kicking kittens or something?

The Times goes on to explain that Media Matters kept their eyes on “30 of the most popular YouTube channels they identified as persistently spreading election misinformation” ahead of the 2024 election.

And the names include Rudy Giuliani, Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro, Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, etc.

“The 30 conservative channels posted 286 videos containing election misinformation, which racked up more than 47 million views,” the Times breathlessly adds. “YouTube generated revenue from more than a third of those videos… Some commentators also made money from those videos[.]”

YouTube, which is owned by the super villains at Google/Alphabet, is so far not budging.

The Times laments the fact that, according to a spokeswoman from YouTube, after reviewing eight of the videos pointed out by the Times YouTube decided they were not in violation of its community guidelines.

The YouTube spokeslady told the Times: “The ability to openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial, is an important value — especially in the midst of election season.” She added that “most” of the YouTube channels cited are already “ineligible for advertising” for violating content policies.

Although at one time YouTube straight-up banned any content that “misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election,” that policy was eased last June. People are now allowed to dispute the outcome of the 2020 presidential election or any past election.

There are plenty of valid reasons to dispute the outcome of previous presidential elections, not just 2020, but 2000 and 1960. And there is no doubt in my mind that Google eased up on its Gestapo-like policies due to upstart outlets like Rumble and Xwitter creating competitive spaces.

But that’s not what this is about…

The Times doesn’t care about people rerunning 2020. What the Times does care about is this…

The organized left, of which the Times is a leader, have hit Trump with everything they have: The years-long Russia collusion hoax, two fake impeachments, manufacturing the mostly peaceful January 6 protest into an insurrection… Trump’s been relentlessly sued and serially indicted by his own fascist government… The FBI raided his home… He’s been relentlessly smeared as a racist, a Nazi, a rapist… For nearly a decade, untold billions of corporate media dollars have been fired at him using lies, threats, attacks on his family, and endless insults… Then he got shot in the head and then someone tried again on a golf course… And yet….

Today he is more popular and polling better than ever before. He might even pull off the greatest political comeback in history.

That’s what this is about.

The New York Times is looking to wipe out the competition for two reasons: 1) Whether Trump wins or loses Tuesday, the fact he could win proves the left are losing their once mighty hold on shaping public opinion, and 2) money-money-money-money. Guys like Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, and Ben Shapiro are vacuuming up millions in advertising dollars the Times desperately needs.

You see, right now the only thing keeping the Times afloat is its far-left subscriber base, and that’s a disaster-in-waiting for the Times — a tiger-by-the-tail situation. When your bias and lies and sanctimony and smugness have chased away all of your customers except the far left, you are living on borrowed time, baby. Your news and editorial pages had better offer them comfort and affirmation (at the expense of truth and facts) or they will wish you into the cornfield. (See: Post, Washington).

Every day the Times publishes with a gun to its head held by millions of left-wing subscribers, which is not the case when your revenue comes from advertisers.

So, what we really have here is a desperate New York Times going the full-McCarthy to take out the intellectual and financial competition.

And this is just the beginning, especially if Trump wins in four days.

Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Iowa by more than 10 percent, according to a recent poll.

An Emerson College poll conducted between November 1-2, 2024, which surveyed 800 likely voters in Iowa, found that 53 percent of respondents expressed support for Trump, while 43 percent of respondents expressed support for Harris.

The poll also found that Harris performed better with “voters under 30,” with 54 percent supporting her, while 46 percent supported Trump.

Trump was found to be leading “among all other age groups over 30 with varied support between six percentage points and 23 points,” according to the poll.

The poll also found that Harris did better with voters who had earned postgraduate degrees, 52 percent to 45 percent, according to the poll.

Roughly 56.3 percent of respondents expressed disapproval over President Joe Biden’s job performance as president, while 34.1 percent expressed approval for his job as president.

A Des Moines Register/Mediacom/Selzer & Co. poll conducted in June, after Trump’s conviction, found that Trump had an 18-point lead over Biden in Iowa, 50 percent to 32 percent.

During the 2020 presidential election, Trump won Iowa with 53.2 percent, while Biden received 45 percent.
BUCKS COUNTY, Pennsylvania — It is nearly impossible to find a street in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that does not have Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz signs lining the sidewalks.

The county is widely considered to be one of the most important battlegrounds within 2024’s most important battleground state as one of the last swing areas left in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton managed to win Bucks County by less than 2,000 votes in 2016, when former President Donald Trump carried the state, and President Joe Biden won it by about 17,000 votes on his way to winning Pennsylvania and the general election in 2020.

With days to go until Election Day, Republicans and Democrats are doing their best to run through the tape and deliver the county — and the Keystone State writ large — for their respective parties. Both parties and aligned outside groups are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the presidential race, as well as down-ballot contests. (RELATED: ‘Just A Dead Heat’: Harry Enten Tells CNN Host 2024 Is ‘Tightest Election’ He’s ‘Ever Seen’)

By The Numbers

Bucks County also provides a cross-section of the state at large, containing urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas. The county’s composition and its demographic breakdown make it a decent indicator of how things may turn out statewide and a county to watch closely as returns start rolling in, a Trump campaign official told the DCNF.

Nearly every prominent pollster and pundit in the country is projecting that Pennsylvania will be as competitive as can be, with Bucks County right in the middle of the partisan tug-of-war. However, Barry Summers — a data engineering consultant by day who has meticulously analyzed Bucks County voting data in efforts to help elect Republicans — believes current early voting and vote-by-mail data suggests Trump will win the county by several percentage points, he told the DCNF.

Relative to the 2020 cycle, Republican mail-in votes are up by about 20,000 — or 60% — in Bucks County, while Democrats have so far managed to secure 98% of the approximately 79,000 mail-in ballots they did in the 2020 cycle, Summers told the DCNF. Meanwhile, Bucks County has seen a 21% increase in mail-in ballots from independent and unaffiliated voters in the 2024 cycle relative to the 2020 cycle, according to Summers.

Summers has also observed that the volume of GOP mail-in votes has accelerated since early October while the pace of Democrat early votes has decelerated since then, and that independent and unaffiliated voters are sending in their votes later “almost in the exact same pattern that the Republicans are,” said Summers. While the pattern alone does not prove anything about voters’ intentions, it suggests to Summers that these unaffiliated and independent voters may be breaking favorably enough for Republicans.

While some of these early votes could cannibalize the Election Day GOP vote, Summers has reason to believe that many of these early votes are coming from lower-propensity voters and that dependable Republican voters will mostly show up to vote on Nov. 5, he told the DCNF. Additionally, Summers sees what he believes to be clear indications that enthusiasm in some key Democratic constituencies, such as young people, is not robust.

“The Democrat propaganda says the youth are outraged and that they’re voting in droves. That is not happening in Bucks County. I looked at voting by age, for 18-year olds, for 19-year olds and so on, what percentage of the people who voted by mail-in ballot are Democrats by each age,” Summers told the DCNF. “The peak share of the Democrat voters are people in their 30s. So, in other words, people in their 30s have registered as mail-in ballot voting Democrats more than any other age of life, the college turnout is very comparable to the Democrat average for the whole county.”

“So what does that tell us?” Summers continued. “That tells us that college age Democrats in Bucks County were as motivated to turn into mail in ballot applications as the average Democrat was overall. There isn’t some surge in the youth vote where they’re all excited and everybody else can’t be bothered. That is just not happening. There’s no passion in the youth vote.”

Moreover, the unaffiliated and independent early vote has skewed toward males so far in Bucks County, a trend that benefits Trump if it holds given that Trump is polling better with men than women in the 2024 cycle, Summers said.

‘We Feel Pretty Confident’

Other Republicans on the ground in Bucks County are also feeling confident to the extent they can, albeit with more anecdotal supporting evidence than the numbers Summers cites. Several Bucks County Republicans pointed out that Trump can theoretically lose Bucks County by a margin of about two percent or less and still be in good shape statewide, as occurred in the 2016 race.

“I am cautiously optimistic. What we’re seeing on the ground here in Bucks County, it’s a wave like we’ve never seen, even in 2020 and 2016,” Ed Sheppard, the communications chair for the Doylestown Republican Committee, told the DCNF. “We’re seeing people who’ve never voted before register to vote, to come out to vote for the Republicans. And I think in Bucks County, the top of the ticket is going to drive the down ballot.”

Bucks County Trump voters who convened on Wednesday at the McDonald’s franchise in the county where the former president campaigned earlier in October also told the DCNF that they sense a level of enthusiasm and urgency from grassroots Republicans that they did not feel in 2020. Numerous local GOP officials and volunteers working to turn out voters also said they are feeling and seeing strong levels of enthusiasm for Trump on the ground in conversations with the DCNF.

Local Democrats, meanwhile, are putting stock in suburban women and the issue of abortion access to help carry Vice President Kamala Harris and down-ballot candidates to victory in the county.

“Women have been underestimated for a very long time, but we could be the reason that Bucks goes blue and we elect a President Harris,” Anna Payne, the local Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania State House, told The New Yorker in October. Nationally and in Pennsylvania, Democrats are betting that campaigning hard on access to abortion could be the key to winning over enough suburban female voters to secure electoral victories, TIME recently reported.

While some Bucks County Republicans are concerned about college-educated women showing up in force for Democrats, others, like Jim Worthington — a longtime Trump donor and ally who led Pennsylvania’s delegation at the Republican National Convention this summer — believe that abortion is not as salient of an issue for the Bucks County electorate as it may have been in the 2022 midterms, which occurred just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

“It’s the issue that cost Dr. Oz the election in the Senate race, as well as vote by mail. They were the two issues that cost him the election, and because they just came off the overturning of Roe,” Worthington told the DCNF. “The Democratic Party used that as a weapon, because people didn’t understand it. And as time went on, more people understood that the power has been put back to each state and the voters of each state. So I don’t think it is nearly the issue it was.”

Worthington’s small army of volunteers mobilizing voters has consistently heard from female voters about the pressures of inflation and higher living costs, he added.

The Trump campaign, meanwhile, does not see a pressing need to tailor a specific message for suburban women in Bucks County beyond urging voters to consider whether they are better off today than they were four years ago, a campaign official told the DCNF.

“Our topline message is the same for whoever we’re talking to. That includes men or women, young or old, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, or whoever. And the message is, are you better off now than you were four years ago?” the Trump campaign official told the DCNF. “We’re bringing up kitchen table, bread-and-butter issues like inflation, cost of living, affordability. We’re talking about things like biological men playing in their or their daughters’ sports and sports leagues and using the same locker bathroom facilities. We’re talking about immigration and crime, especially in areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh … We’re not treating [suburban women] like an exotic other, but another group of voters who are affected by things like inflation, by crime, by these far-left pushes on things like biological men playing in women’s sports, and that sort of thing.”

“We’re not resting on our laurels or taking anything for granted, obviously, but overall, we feel pretty confident in Bucks County, and by extension, the rest of Pennsylvania.”

LAS VEGAS, Nevada — At the amphitheater where Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Thursday night, her supporters found something more unsettling than the spooky costumes some attendees wore or the chaotic bus ride from the venue to the off-site parking lot: the possibility of losing.

“Honestly, it’s scary,” Lee, a union member who moved to Las Vegas in 2005, told the Daily Caller News Foundation during Harris’ rally. “I talk to a lot of people, and it’s like, really close. But my heart wants her to win, so I’m gonna stick with my heart.”

Both presidential candidates made stops in the Silver State — on what locals know as not only Halloween, but Nevada Day — to make their final pitch before the close of early voting in a tight race where the state’s six electoral votes could be decisive.

While energy and turnout was high at both events, Trump supporters were far quicker to express confidence in a Nov. 5 victory than Harris supporters, who remained hopeful but uncertain.

Lee told the DCNF he is backing Harris because of her plans for developing the economy of Puerto Rico (he noted his distaste for comments about the island made at a recent Trump rally), along with Harris’ support for unions. “She’s super important to us,” he said.

The Culinary Union, which supports a large get out the vote operation, has been a long-time key to Democrats’ success in the valley.

Republicans currently lead in early voting and have been working hard to turn out low-propensity voters, along with groups that lean Democrat like Latinos and Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), which respectively make up around 20% and 12% of the vote in Nevada.

Trump’s rally in Las Vegas last week focused on reaching out to the AAPI community.

“We need to be proud of our country,” Robin, a Filipino immigrant who said he came to the U.S. for the American dream, told the DCNF at Trump’s rally. “We’ve been heading the opposite direction.”

Robin, who said Trump will win “for sure,” is also one of many disillusioned Californians now living in Las Vegas. “We’re definitely not bringing California over here,” he said.

Some Trump rally attendees flew in from California just to show their support.

“There is nothing like a Trump rally,” California resident Kristen told the DCNF while decked out in a McDonalds t-shirt and a neon trash collector vest, a reference to President Joe Biden’s comment about Trump supporters being garbage. “I actually came out last week for the rally also, and I went to the one at Coachella, and I went to one in Arizona.”

“He’s going to win in a landslide, unless they cheat,” another supporter from Los Angeles said. (RELATED: Swing State Republicans Are Leaning Into Ballot Harvesting — And It Seems To Be Working)

Maureen and Rose, two women who also sported neon vests, expressed confidence Trump would win as long as there aren’t any “tricks or cheating.”

“I feel a difference in the energy, and every single day that gets closer to the fifth, I feel it getting stronger and stronger,” one of the women said.

Dan, who said he’s been a Trump fan since 2016, is thrilled by the team he’s assembled this cycle. “Trump’s going to win,” he said. “100%”

“Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Make America Healthy Again, is the most fantastic news that I’ve heard from any political candidate in my lifetime,” Dan said.

‘Feeling The Vibes In Nevada’

Trump supporters routinely named the border and economy as top issues. GOP campaign staffers believe this message is resonating with crowds that don’t typically vote Republican.

Some Harris supporters named the economy and immigration as concerns, but for most, it wasn’t the main factor in their vote.

“I think the immigration is, I don’t want to say not real, but it’s kind of not as big of an issue … as the Republican Party wants to make people believe,” one Harris supporter told the DCNF. “Women’s rights, that’s a big one for me.”

One rally goer wouldn’t weigh in on Harris’ odds, telling the DCNF he is a noncitizen who would not be voting.

Certain Harris voters struggle to envision a world where Trump wins.

“I think that our country is sick of hate,” Lindsey, a long-time Democrat, told the DCNF. “Like that’s all Donald Trump puts out is hate. And I think we’re all over it.”

One supporter said Harris has gained a lot of traction since entering the race late. “I think she’s doing an excellent job,” he said.

Amanda, a lesbian woman who came to the rally with her same-sex partner, said the economy and abortion were key issues for her, though her vote was driven by feeling her identity is welcomed by the Democratic party. She was certain Harris would win.

“I really, truly believe that. With everything in me,” she said. “I’m optimistic, and if it’s blindly optimistic, then I will be shocked, but I am very positive and I’m very hopeful.” (RELATED: Republicans Hopeful ‘Historic’ Early Vote Turnout Could Enable Unexpected Swing State Candidate To Flip The Senate)

Many Harris supporters, however, realize the race is tight. James, who supports Harris because he doesn’t believe in “controlling women’s bodies” but does believe in taxing billionaires, said he’s “feeling the vibes in Nevada” but knows it will be close.

“I play hockey, and like half my team is Trump supporters, and half my team is Kamala,” he said.

Moses, a son of immigrant parents who is voting for Harris because he wants to make sure other people in his position “have the same opportunities,” has no idea how the race will pan out. “I feel like it could go either Kamala in a big wave or really competitive or the other way around,” he said.

‘”I’m still pretty young, and I want to buy a house and make sure that it’s an affordable option for me … like, my whole paycheck isn’t just going for the mortgage and stuff,” Moses explained.

Harris has proposed offering up to $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers, a policy another couple with adult children who came to the rally said appealed to them.

Kenny, an independent who cares about inflation, the federal deficit and crime, attended the rally even though he is not fully on board with Harris, though he is leaning towards voting for her.

“The reality is, my wife kind of dragged me over here,” he told the DCNF while standing in the food line outside the amphitheater.

As supporters waited to board departing buses after Harris’ rally, volunteers distributed candy and postcards with a QR code they could scan to identify people in their phone’s contacts lists who have not yet voted. For both campaigns, these final days are the last opportunity to win over voters like Kenny.

“In the back of my mind, I’m thinking Trump’s gonna win if it’s close, and right now, everything is neck and neck,” Kenny continued. “But who knows?”

It is “disgusting” that President Joe Biden called supporters of former President Donald Trump “garbage” at a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, but that is likely just the tip of the iceberg, according to Sen. JD Vance, who said on Breitbart News Saturday, “Imagine what they’re saying about you in private.”

“I think it’s disgusting, Matt. And it’s not just that that he is Kamala Harris’s boss. It’s that it was during a Kamala Harris campaign event that he made these remarks,” Vance said, reacting to Biden referring to Trump supporters as “garbage,” despite his spin that he was referring only to a comedian who spoke at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.

Vance pointed out that this rhetoric really is not new.

“It echoes what Tim Walz has said, calling everybody who supports Donald Trump a fascist, accusing the Madison Square Garden rally attendees of being Nazis. They have run a campaign unlike anything that we’ve ever seen. They were attacking their fellow Americans for disagreeing with Kamala Harris’s policies,” he said, contrasting that rhetoric with what he presents at Trump-Vance rallies.

“I go out of my way to remind the rally attendees, the media, that our beef, our criticism, is with Kamala Harris and her policies. Even our fellow Americans who we disagree with politically — they’re not the enemy. The problem is Kamala Harris’s broken leadership of this country,” he said, noting that he has “never seen a campaign that is so focused on attacking their fellow citizens.”

“If you’re struggling with groceries, you’re not garbage. If you’re pissed off at the Kamala Harris open the border, you’re not garbage. If you think that Kamala Harris … her leadership has led to chaos around the world, you’re not garbage. The only garbage is Kamala Harris has failed leadership, and I think we should take that garbage out … by voting for Donald J. Trump,” he said, emphasizing that voters have a distinct choice in this election.

“There’s a choice to reject the open borders. There’s a choice to reject the censorship, to reject the bad trade deals … to reject the stupid foreign policy. There is a choice to reject the idea that we are lorded over, that we are ruled over by our leaders, and not that our leaders are servants of us. And this is the choice that’s on the ballot,” he said before asking listeners to consider what these people — who openly call Americans “garbage” — are saying about them in private.

LISTEN:

“Think about this. What are they saying in private? If they’re saying this in public, if they’re saying that you’re garbage, you’re a fascist, you’re a Nazi in public, imagine what they’re saying about you in private,” Vance said.

“We don’t have to be ruled by these people. We can be led by a guy who actually loves this country, who loves his fellow citizens, and that’s what Donald J. Trump is offering. It’s not just better policies. It’s respect — respect for the country that he wants to be the president of,” Vance said. “Kamala Harris doesn’t have it. Donald Trump does.”

Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.
Hoover Institute Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson said Friday on his podcast that he believes Democrats are feeling more depressed and angry than usual because they fear they could be losing.

Polls between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have tightened with fewer than five days until Election Day. On “The Victor Davis Hanson Show,” the senior fellow called out a recent take from CNN’s senior reporter Harry Enten for claiming election polling could be underestimating Harris and noted that her campaign has shifted its resources from North Carolina to Virginia in search of a path to 270 electoral votes.

“My point is that I think that’s a standard response when they look at those internal polls. Now, why would I say that? They wouldn’t be shifting resources from North Carolina to Virginia,” Hanson said. “They’re ahead in Virginia, but if they were shifting resources from North Carolina to Virginia, then it would be because they’re behind in Virginia and they’re ahead, so far ahead in North Carolina, they don’t need it.”

“No, they’re shifting it because they’re behind in North Carolina, and their internal polls say they can’t win it. And I mean, internal polls that are specific, Latino groups, black groups, Asian women, men,” Hanson added. “They don’t have the numbers that they need to win that. So then they look at Virginia, and they have an alternate pathway to 270 and Virginia is absolutely central. While they’re still ahead, at the rate they’re losing in seven days, they will lose that state. So they’re putting resources in there.”

Hanson continued to state that while he believes Democrats like MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough and Joy Reid are always angry, their anger has increased over the election despite Harris’ campaign message first centering on joy. (RELATED: ‘Whatever It Takes’: Political Strategist Says Dems Must Quit Coddling Biden Just To Make Him Feel ‘Included’)

WATCH:

“There wouldn’t be this sense of gaiety and happiness. I think it’s, I’m kind of worried about overconfidence in the Trump people and depression in the Harris [camp]. They didn’t, you know, even if you were out there and feel that the mail-in balloting, they master and they have machinations that will help them, they wouldn’t be just so depressed. They are depressed, they really are, and they’re angry,” Hanson said.

“You look at Brzezinski , you look at Joe Scarborough, her husband … then you look at Joy Reid, you look at Rachel Maddow and then you look at the [View] — they’re all angry. I mean, they’re angry people anyway, but they’re just really angry. They have these, they kind of remind me of the people, when they know they’re losing and they’re all in a room together and they’re just, they can’t face reality — fantasy,” Hanson said. I don’t know if they’re really losing, but I don’t think that they’re under-polled. I really don’t.”

While Trump had once been slightly leading across all seven key wing states in mid-October, Harris gained both Michigan and Wisconsin back over the last week, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics. Data from the site currently shows the former president has a 0.3 point lead nationally, sitting with 48.4% and Harris behind at 48.1%.

Democratic insiders and strategists heading into the final hours of the election are expressing confidence that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump on Tuesday at the ballot box.

"Nauseously optimistic," is how Democrats described themselves to New York magazine as the clock continues ticking for the final 100 hours of the election cycle.

Trump and Harris both delivered what were their respective closing arguments earlier this week, with Trump addressing massive crowds at a historic rally at Madison Square Garden, and Harris delivering her final pitch in the nation’s capital Tuesday at the Ellipse, located just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.

Polls are neck-and-neck, with a Fox News national survey published last month finding that Trump had a two-point edge over Harris, while the pair have zeroed-in on campaigning in key battleground states to increase the weight on their respective political scales. As of Saturday morning, Trump has nine events scheduled until Election Day, zig-zagging from battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Michigan to Georgia and also Virginia.

Harris is expected to travel to Georgia and North Carolina on Saturday, before delivering her final pitch to voters in Michigan’s rust belt on Sunday. As she caps off her final leg of the campaign since ascending the top of the Democratic ticket in July, when President Biden dropped out of the race, her allies have touted that she has a win within her grasp.

HARRIS HOLDS COMMANDING 10-POINT LEAD OVER TRUMP IN VIRGINIA: POLL

David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the Harris campaign, said this weekend that voters deciding for whom to cast their ballot late into the election are going to benefit the Harris campaign and carry them to a victory.

"The question is, of the people who have not yet decided who to vote for, who are actually going to vote?" he said on CNN Friday, noting that current polls show Harris and Trump tied. "And our sense in the last week is that the people who have made up their mind in the last week we’re doing quite well with, and we like the people who have yet to make a decision . . . ."

DEM STRATEGIST JAMES CARVILLE CERTAIN HARRIS WILL WIN, KNOCKS 'SWEATY' DEMOCRATS

"It’s very important to look at who those undecideds are," Plouffe added.

Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville, who worked as lead strategist for former President Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 election, touted that Harris’ financial backing and "united" Democrat Party sets her up for a win over Trump come Tuesday.

"I think she’s going to win," Carville said on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" on Friday. "She’s got more money, more energy, has a more united party, has better surrogates, and he’s stone-a--nuts."

New York magazine detailed in a piece this week that the buzz among Democrats is they are cautiously optimistic of a win on Tuesday, "largely based on the campaign’s close monitoring of early voting data from the seven battleground states, and its evolving understanding of who has already cast ballots and who’s left to convince."

"The posture is driven both by reports from the field, especially from canvassers in competitive suburbs, and by senior advisers staring at the analytics in Wilmington. It’s far from a prediction of a win. Instead, it’s a belief that Harris maintains achievable paths to winning a majority or plurality of the vote in the tightly contested states — each of which they see as effectively tied, and almost all of which they see as home to a Democratic advantage in get-out-the-vote operations," the outlet reported.

Other Democratic insiders are reporting more or less the same on social media and during media interviews.

DEMOCRATS HAVE AN ENORMOUS DILEMMA IF KAMALA HARRIS LOSES

Jon Favreau, former President Barack Obama’s director of speechwriting, posted on X, for example, that though the race is an "extremely close toss-up," he argued that Trump isn’t ending on a strong note, pointing to jokes made by a comedian at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally that were viewed negatively by the media and Democrats and other political issues he sees as election demerits.

Daily Beast columnist and political affairs analyst David Rothkopf declared in a column on Friday that, "Kamala Harris is going to be the next president of the United States," pointing to Harris’ "exceptional campaign," speeches that were "suffused with a new energy and vision" for the nation, and her "‘closing argument’ on the Ellipse in Washington."

"On January 20, 2025, she will become America’s first woman president, America’s first woman of color to be commander-in-chief and America’s first person of Asian heritage to become the country’s chief executive," he wrote.

CNN senior political data reporter Harry Enten said Thursday that there are "clear" signs of a Harris win.

"And the number-one sign is that Harris, simply put, is more popular than Donald Trump," he said.

The Trump campaign and its allies have meanwhile remained steadfast that the Republican ticket will be victorious on Tuesday, as Trump rallies his base to vote early and attracts new supporters through his "make America great again" pleddge following the Biden-Harris administration. As the cycle entered its final weeks, Trump said during a Las Vegas rally last month that the Harris campaign is "imploding" and has a victory in his sights.

"[Harris is] actually imploding, if you take a look. Because, look, I'm not supposed to say it, but we are leading by so much," Trump said last Thursday.

"Now, we're leading by a lot in Nevada. We're leading by a lot in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Even states that are typically never in play for 50, 60, 70 years. . . . But the fact is that states, other states too, big states, are all in play and they like us. But you know what? They think she is grossly incompetent. Let's face it, she is not doing well," Trump continued.

The 45th president added during his Madison Square Garden rally that he will have the "biggest victory in the history of our country" on Election Day.

"We're running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala. And far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today's Democrat Party. They're just vessels. In fact, they're perfect vessels, because they'll never give them a hard time. They'll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It's just this amorphous group of people. But they're smart, and they're vicious, and we have to defeat them," he said.

"We're going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on Nov. 5, and it's going to be the biggest victory in history. We're going to make America great again."
The daughter of the late NFL legend Jim Brown endorsed former President Donald Trump, explaining how his support for the Black community shifted her perspective during his first term in office.

Kimberly Brown revealed how her father's involvement with Trump "opened" her eyes during "FOX & Friends," and explained why she decided to endorse the former president as opposed to Vice President Kamala Harris.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ENDORSES HARRIS, BUZZ ALDRIN BACKS TRUMP

"My dad went to go meet with President-elect Trump, and when my dad went to go meet with the president-elect, that really opened up my eyes," Brown said on Friday. "I stayed neutral for about a year within his presidency, and after that… I came out as a Trump supporter because I saw the moves that Donald Trump was making."

"Within the first 100 days, he gave us our religious rights with an executive order," she continued. "I saw that he was defunding Planned Parenthood, the No. 1 killer of Black lives. He created the First Step Act, signed that in for prison reform. My father consulted on the First Step Act. School choice, record-breaking HBCU funding, so I saw that Trump was doing a lot for Black people."

Brown, who is a professional athlete herself, explained that protecting the sanctity of women's sports is a key issue for her this election, and that is another reason she will cast her ballot for the former president.

"I play tackle football. I don't want to be on the field with a man wearing a wig, taking hormones, taking hits," she said. "That's already going to affect me physically with injuries. I'm already susceptible to CTE, to concussions, and for a 300-pound man to go against me, that's going to put me at risk and is going to put other girls and women at risk, as well as the mental trauma of them coming into our safe spaces."

"It's unfair. They're taking away opportunities. They're taking away funding. They're taking away women's rights," she continued. "And Title IX was to protect us. Title IX was to give us a fair, equal playing field and not to be discriminated against. This is not similar. This is a whole other sex coming into our sport and taking over, and I don't understand how the Biden-Harris administration is pushing this agenda."

MARK CUBAN: TRUMP DOESN'T ASSOCIATE WITH ‘STRONG, INTELLIGENT WOMEN, EVER’

Brown was also asked about her take on billionaire Mark Cuban's recent remarks on "The View," when he suggested the women who support him and surround Trump are weak and unintelligent.

"Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. Ever," Cuban said Thursday. "It’s just that simple. They're intimidating to him. He doesn't like to be challenged by them."

Brown called Cuban's remarks "completely false."

"Donald Trump surrounds himself with strong, intelligent women, and he wouldn't be where he is today if he wasn't surrounded by strong, intelligent women," she said. "And those same strong, intelligent women are going to get him back into the White House, and for him to become the 47th President of the United States."

Cuban later tried to "clarify" his remarks on X following a swarm of backlash.

"This is what I said during a conversation about why Nikki Haley was not active in his campaign," he wrote. "I know many strong, intelligent women voting for Trump , including in my extended family. I’m certainly not saying female voters are not smart, strong and intelligent.

"I know he has worked with strong, intelligent women, like Elaine Chao, Kelly Anne, Ivanka and many others," Cuban added. "I stand by my opinion that he does not like being challenged publicly."
A Fox News report said that multiple campaign calls scheduled on Thursday with President Joe Biden were canceled after a disastrous remark he made that has derailed the Harris-Walz campaign.

The development gave critics more ammunition in their case that Biden's declining cognitive condition made him unfit to continue in the Oval Office.

The development was reported by Fox News' senior White House correspondent, Jacqui Heinrich.

The campaign calls were publicly advised on Biden's schedule but were abruptly canceled. Heinrich said they tried to contact the organizations which were holding the calls, but they did not respond when asked whether the calls continued on without Biden.

The president opened up a political firestorm when he appeared to call the supporters of President Donald Trump "garbage" while speaking with Voto Latino. Former President Donald Trump pounced on the comments and hammered on Biden by running a media briefing from the cab of a garbage truck. He went on to speak at a rally with his orange construction vest on.

Biden has no official campaign events scheduled ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.

The advisory of the later canceled events read as follows: "Thursday, October 31, 2024 In the afternoon, the President will participate in campaign calls."

The White House did not comment on the story.

Biden's "garbage" comment gave the Trump campaign an escape hatch to pummel Democrats after a comedian referred to Puerto Rico as an "island of garbage" while speaking at Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden.

The development gave critics more ammunition in their case that Biden's declining cognitive condition made him unfit to continue in the Oval Office.

People stood in line for hours on Friday at Bucks County, Pennsylvania, election offices waiting for their chance to participate in the election. Some were outraged that the line was so slow and the county did not have more election workers on hand.

“They opened at 8:00,” Pat Poprik, chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee told The Federalist. “People were there at 8:30 and by 12:30 they had not voted. … The average wait was like four or five hours.”

Some social media posts claimed the long lines were purposeful and were evidence of the county attempting to suppress voters, but Poprik does not think so.

“I don’t think it’s voter suppression. I think it was inconvenient. They were not disenfranchised. They were still able to vote, albeit inconvenient and a long time, but they weren’t not allowed. It wasn’t like Tuesday when they put that placard down and said you can’t vote. That was disenfranchisement, and that’s what the judge addressed, and rightly so.”

It’s after 7 p.m. & voters are STILL waiting for their ballots.



Was this intentional in a county that we recently flipped from 🔵🔜🔴?

The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign went to the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas this week, complaining the county’s action of turning voters away before the 5:00 p.m. deadline on Tuesday violated the election code.

The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot in Pennsylvania was Tuesday, Oct. 29 at 5:00 p.m., but so many people applied for a mail-in ballot in the days before the deadline — and in many cases, then filled out the ballot on the spot and turned it back into the election worker by hand — that long lines formed.

It was averaging 12 minutes to process each ballot request, Bucks County Spokesman James T. O’Malley previously told The Federalist. County workers estimated how many people they could serve by the 5:00 p.m. deadline Tuesday, then cut off the line before 3:00 p.m., saying anyone after a certain point in the line would not be able to hand in their completed ballot at the desk that day. Anyone still in line could get a mail-in ballot that would be prepared the next day and be available for pickup.

“The judge felt the way most of us felt,” Poprik said. “Putting that sign down, telling people they couldn’t go in when their website said 10:00 to 5:00.”

The judge extended the deadline to Friday, Nov. 1, at 5:00 p.m., and on Friday night, the last members of the public were still being served by election workers near 8:00 p.m., when Poprik left.

This logjam happened because Pennsylvania does not technically have “early voting,” just something that looks a lot like it.

Not Election Day, Not a Polling Place

To understand what has caused these long lines, you need to know that Pennsylvania has “in-person” voting on Election Day and, new as of 2020, “mail-in” voting.

A mail-in ballot can (obviously) be sent back to the election office through the U.S. Postal Service, it can also be dropped off in a secure drop box, or it can be handed in at the counter of an election office until 8 p.m. on Election Day.

🚨 NOW: Voting lines in Bucks County, PA are up to FIVE HOURS LONG



This is NOT an accident. It’s voter suppression.



Some office only have 1-2 staffers in them, which is meant to ENSURE long lines.



If you’re there by 5pm, STAY IN LINE. YOU CAN VOTE. pic.twitter.com/WzQVonHIDV — Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) November 1, 2024

To vote by mail, you must request a mail-in ballot. The ballot can be mailed to you, or it can be applied for and picked up in person.

Some voters fill out the ballot on the spot and hand it back to the election worker. This has become known as “on-demand mail-in voting.” It’s a nutty name, because in this case, the mail-in ballot never touches the mail.

🚨🇺🇸 THE TURNOUT OF TRUMP VOTERS HERE IN BUCKS COUNTY IS MASSIVE



Early voters are now lined up AROUND THE BLOCK here in Doylestown.



Shout-out to the @GOP for winning their lawsuit and getting the deadline for early voting extended until 5pm today here in Bucks County. pic.twitter.com/G8TsdIbfyK — Diligent Denizen 🇺🇸 (@DiligentDenizen) November 1, 2024

This is what the people in line mean when they say they have come to vote. They are really there to request a mail-in ballot. It is a different function and slower function than voting in person on Election Day.

To prevent fraud (for example, an individual ‘voting early’ using on-demand mail-in voting and voting on Election Day), election workers must handle extra paperwork with each on-demand mail-in vote.

The election worker must look the voter up in the state computer system and ensure that he is eligible to vote, identify what precinct he should vote in, print an individual ballot specific to his precinct, and mark the individual in the state computer system as having requested a mail-in ballot before handing the voter a ballot and two envelopes.

Election Day is different because the poll book is prepared by then. Voters go to their own precincts, where their names appear in the poll book. Ballots are already printed, extra workers and poll watchers are on hand, and multiple voting booths are set up to serve more people at once.

Pennsylvania Republicans have gotten skunked in recent elections because Democrats embraced mail-in voting and Republicans have been mistrustful of it. In 2020, Trump was urging people to vote in person.

When the 2022 midterm election results came in, Republicans were leading or close in many races when in-person votes were counted. But as mail-in votes were counted, the lead evaporated and Democrats won many races.

Republicans at every level recognized the strategy and pushed hard for mail-in participation in 2024. They targeted the low-propensity Republican voters who may be unwilling to stand in line on Election Day and encouraged everyone to vote early — in Pennsylvania that means requesting a mail-in ballot.

Poprik said it seemed to be mostly Trump supporters in line Friday, although there were some Harris supporters. She said the state legislature should address the issues caused by mail-in voting and make sure there is a uniform process in counties across the state.

And she put in a good word for the election workers who put in long hours Friday.

“The workers were wonderful. The fault lies at the top, with the board of elections — the commissioners. They did not have enough people. I guess they underestimated how many people would take advantage of this.”

With the 2024 U.S. election around the corner, celebrities have been stepping forward to publicly endorse either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump for president of the United States.

From Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lopez to Jason Aldean and Kelsey Grammer, these stars have used their platforms to share their thoughts and beliefs on why their preferred candidate should win.

Here's a look at celebrities who have publicly supported the presidential candidates.

Vice President Kamala Harris

Bruce Springsteen

On Oct. 3, Bruce Springsteen took to social media to share his support for Harris and Walz.

"Friends, fans and the press have asked me who I'm supporting in this most important of elections," he said from the bar stool of an undisclosed diner. "And with full knowledge that my opinion is no more or less important than those of any of my fellow citizens, here's my answer: I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walz for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and J.D. Vance."

Springsteen went on to call Trump "the most dangerous candidate for president" in his lifetime, citing "his disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power" as reasons he should never be allowed in the Oval Office again.

"On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity. And they wanna grow our economy in a way that benefits all. Not just a few, like me, on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years."

His endorsement caught the eye of Walz, who commented below Springsteen's post, "Bruce — as a lifelong fan, I couldn’t be more honored to have your support."

Harris later commented, "Thank you, @Springsteen. Our democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, and I am grateful you are with us in this fight."

Beyoncé

Beyoncé, a native of Houston, spoke at a Kamala Harris rally in Houston on Oct. 25.

"We are so happy to be standing here on this stage as proud, country Texas women, supporting and celebrating the one and only, Vice President Harris. A woman who's been pushing for what this country really needs right now: unity," said Beyoncé, who was accompanied by former Destiny's Child singing mate Kelly Rowland.

"I'm not here as a celebrity. I'm not here as a politician. I'm here as a mother. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies. A world where we're not divided — our past, our present, our future merged to meet us here.

"Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what's possible with no ceilings," she continued. "No limitations. Imagine our grandmothers, imagine what they feel right now, those who have lived to see this historic day. Even those who are no longer physically with us, imagine all of their sacrifices. The sacrifices made so we can witness the strength of a woman standing in her power, reimagining what leadership is. For all the men and women in this room and watching around the country, we need you."

After her appearance, Beyoncé took to social media to share some snapshots of the event.

"Time for a new song," she captioned the post.

Jennifer Lopez

During her appearance at a Harris rally in Las Vegas on Oct. 31, Jennifer Lopez said, "At Madison Square Garden, [Donald Trump] reminded us who he really is and how he really feels," the "Let's Get Loud" singer said.

She was referencing the controversial joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at a Trump rally a few days prior.

"It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day, OK? It was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character.

"I promised myself that I wouldn’t be emotional. You know what? We should be emotional," she later added. "We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should."

"Our pain matters. We matter," she added. "You matter. Your voice and your vote matters."

Arnold Schwarzenegger

Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his endorsement of Kamala Harris this week.

Schwarzenegger, 77, who served as the Republican governor of California from 2003 to 2011, said he was putting country before politics by handing out his second-ever presidential endorsement.

"I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians. I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor," he wrote in a lengthy post on X. "Let me be honest with you: I don’t like either party right now. My Republicans have forgotten the beauty of the free market, driven up deficits, and rejected election results. Democrats aren’t any better at dealing with deficits, and I worry about their local policies hurting our cities with increased crime.

"It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isn’t addicted to this crap, you probably understand. I want to tune out. But I can’t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz."

He concluded his message by urging all citizens to vote.

"Even if you disagree with me, vote, because that’s what we do as Americans."

Taylor Swift

Shortly after the 2024 presidential debate between Harris and Trump concluded in September, Taylor Swift endorsed Harris.

On Instagram, the mega pop star wrote, "Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.



"Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site," she continued. "It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth."

"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," she added. "I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.



"I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice," she concluded. "Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story. With love and hope, Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady."

Jennifer Aniston

Earlier this week, Jennifer Aniston endorsed Harris.

"Today not only did I vote for access to health care, for reproductive freedom, for equal rights, for safe schools, and for a fair economy, but also for SANITY and HUMAN DECENCY," Aniston started her caption on Instagram. "Please remember that whoever you are and wherever you live, your voice matters. Your VOTE matters. I know we don’t agree on everything, and that is the beauty of this country, but GOOD LORD aren’t you tired of this negativity towards each other? The intimidation and constant threats to those who do not think the same as the other?



"Let’s please end this era of fear, chaos and the attacks on our democracy - and vote for someone who will unite us and not continue to threaten to divide us," she added, announcing she had "proudly voted for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz."

Anne Hathaway

On Oct. 29, Anne Hathaway shared a short and sweet endorsement of Harris.

"Spoiler alert: I voted for Kamala and Joe (and it felt goooooooooooood)," she wrote on on Instagram.

Oprah

During the third day of the Democratic National Convention, Oprah Winfrey appeared onstage after the Obamas spoke, saying everyone in the crowd was "fired up."

"We can't wait to leave here and do something. And what we're gonna do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States," she said.

In 2020, Winfrey expressed her joy after Harris was nominated to become the first-ever Black female Vice President.

"I think what she means for women of the world is so extraordinary," she told People magazine at the time. "For women here in the United States, we can't even measure it. Because to see someone who looks like you in this role, you see what's possible for yourself. Period."

"And the generational impact: You can't put a price on it," she added. "You can't put a measurement on it," Winfrey, 66, continued. "I'm just hoping we get through the inauguration and turn the page on this really challenging time for democracy."

George Clooney

After imploring President Biden to not run for re-election, George Clooney voiced his support for Biden's second in command, Harris.

"President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He’s saving democracy once again. We’re all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest," Clooney said in a statement to CNN's Jake Tapper.

Julia Roberts

In a voice-over for a Harris ad this month, Julia Roberts said, "In the one place in America, where women still have the right to choose, you can vote anyway you want. And no one will ever know. Remember, what happens in the booth, stays in the booth. Vote Harris-Walz."

She captioned the post, "Vote! It is our superpower."

Harrison Ford

Harrison Ford endorsed Harris for president during the 2024 election.

On Saturday, the Harris-Walz campaign released a video promoting their partnership with the Hollywood star.

"When dozens of former members of the Trump administration are sounding alarms, saying, ‘For God’s sake, don’t do this again,’ you have to pay attention," he said.

"They’re telling us something important. These aren’t soft people. They’re governors, generals, standing up against the leader of the party they spent their lives advocating for. For many of them, this will be the first time they’ve ever voted for someone who doesn’t have an ‘R’ next to their name. Because they know this really matters.

"The truth is this, Kamala Harris will protect your right to disagree with her about policies or ideas, and then, as we have done for centuries, we’ll debate them. We’ll work on them together, and we’ll move forward. The other guy, he demands unquestioning loyalty, says he wants revenge. I’m Harrison Ford. I’ve got one vote — same as anyone else — and I’m going to use it to move forward. I’m going to vote for Kamala Harris," he concluded.

Madonna

On Halloween, Madonna took to Instagram to tell her supporters to get out and vote.

The singer shared pictures of a recent trip to Paris with the caption: "Paris was so FUN! FR. It was hard to leave, but I had. to come. to V.O.T.E. usus @kamalaharris For. President!!!!"

Robert Downey Jr and more Marvel stars

The Avengers reunited to endorse Harris for president.

Actors Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Danai Gurira, Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany took part in a video endorsement for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz that was posted on Ruffalo’s X account on Oct. 31.

"We're back. Let's #AssembleForDemocracy. In the #ElectionEndgame, every vote counts," Ruffalo wrote, encouraging people to vote for Harris and Democrats.

In the video, they jokingly suggested Harris needed a catchphrase, referencing their past movies.

"How about this? I’m just off the top of my head: ‘I can do this all day,’" Evans said.

"What about something punchier like—" Downey said.

"Boom! You looking for this?" Cheadle finished.

"Kamala forever," Gurira added.

Bettany remarked, "How about ‘I’m down with democracy’? It’s clean and simple."

"I’m Kamala Harris and I say down with democracy," Cheadle joked, adding, "Yeah, together we got to tear down democracy."

Near the end of the video, he phrased it saying, "I’m Kamala Harris, and I am down with democracy."

Alec Baldwin

On Sunday, Baldwin endorsed Harris for president.

"Today is Sunday, two more days is the election - I think nearly all of us know what's at stake," Baldwin said. "People say, ‘Oh, the future of the country is at stake,’ and that might be true, but what's at stake is the next four years.

"In terms of certain problems we have with - yes, the border and yes, what our military is gonna be asked to do and what we're gonna pay for that - but the environment is the most important thing to me right now, because you can't undo it," Baldwin continued.

Baldwin then took a jab at Elon Musk.

"Elon Musk comes up with ideas which are apparently great ideas, people love their Teslas; Elon Musk comes up with ideas but none that I know of are going to solve our environmental problem. Maybe the Musks of the world could turn their attention toward solving those problems on a grand scale, that would be great," Baldwin said.

Baldwin called Harris a "far better" option than Trump, "although [she] might not dot every I and cross every T."

"One candidate wants to put the military on the streets to quash rebellion and quash free speech. The other candidate would be a history-making statement - not that we vote for somebody for that reason alone - about how progressive this country really is and how they're willing to go to any length necessary to run this country," Baldwin said.

Leonardo DiCaprio

Leonardo DiCaprio shared a video on Instagram endorsing Harris for president, citing climate change as one of his deciding factors.

"Climate change is killing the Earth and ruining our economy, we need a bold step forward to save our economy, our planet and ourselves," DiCaprio said. "That’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris."

His Instagram caption read, "The devastation that our country recently experienced from Hurricanes Helene and Milton shows the continued threat of unnatural disasters caused by climate change.

"We need leaders who are equipped to enact climate policies that will help save the planet, and that’s why I’m casting my vote for @KamalaHarris on November 5. She has helped lead the most significant climate action in U.S. history, and under her leadership we will be able to accomplish ambitious goals on climate policy that will move our country forward," he continued.

Stevie Nicks

Stevie Nicks voiced her support for Harris during a recent interview with MSNBC. She explained one of her main reasons for supporting Harris was abortion.

"We have to find a way to bring back Roe v. Wade," the singer said. "We all had to pick causes, this is the cause I chose."

Nicks recently released a song titled, "The Lighthouse," which focused on women's reproductive rights. During the interview, she referenced her song and encouraged people to "read the words, listen to the song and vote no matter what."

Former President Donald Trump

Jason Aldean

In July, Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany Aldean, were spotted at the Republican National Convention in the Trump family box.

After the first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Aldean posted to Instagram to show his support and well-wishes for "45."

"This is what a Warrior looks like!," Aldean wrote in his caption attached to a photograph of Trump with blood on his face and a stiff arm raised to the crowd of campaign rally attendees. "@realdonaldtrump we are thinking about u and praying for you and your family. God has a bigger plan for you, my friend, and I think we all know what that is by now."

On Oct. 23, Aldean took the stage at a rally in Georgia to introduce Trump.

"He’s a president who, when knocked down, gets back up, raises his fist in the air and says ‘fight,’" Aldean said, referring to the first assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania this summer. "And, to me, that’s a warrior," Aldean said. "That’s who we need running this country right now."

Kelsey Grammer

During an interview with the New York Times in September, Kelsey Grammer, a proud Republican, opened up about his political views.

"For me to be anything else would be a problem," Grammer said of his political party. "I don’t go along with a lot of what is preached in Hollywood.

"I go along with what is preached in Christianity. I go along with ‘do unto others as you would have others do unto you.’ And I believe in all people. I believe in their desires and their lives and their worth. I want to make shows about that. I don’t want to hate anybody."

During a segment on BBC Radio 4’s "Today" program in 2023, Grammer confirmed his support for Trump.

Host Justin Webb asked Grammer, "You mentioned Roseanne early on, who had a great comeback but also was a Trump supporter. You were, at least you were, a Trump supporter. I’m fascinated to know if you still are?"

"I am," Grammer said. "And I’ll let that be the end of it."

Drea de Matteo

On Nov. 1, "Sopranos" actress Drea de Matteo took to social media to publicly endorse Trump.

"Guess who we voted for?" the Emmy-winning actress said in an Instagram story, according to NME. "We voted for ourselves. We the people. You n me with the justice league in place to drain the f--- neocon/corporate swamp."

In another story, per the outlet, the actress wore a T-shirt featuring the words "TRUMP 2024″ and "F--- YOUR FEELINGS" and urged her followers to "research your reality."

Dennis Quaid

Earlier this month, Dennis Quaid rallied for former President Trump in Coachella, California, addressing a crowd.



"God bless you. God bless America. I'm here today to tell you that it's time to pick a side," Quaid said on stage. "Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution? Or for TikTok? Are we going to be a nation of law and order? Or wide open borders? Which is it? Because it's time to pick a side."

Quaid portrayed President Reagan, his "favorite president of the 20th century," in the 2024 biopic . The actor drew parallels between the political landscape when Reagan was first elected and the present.

"It's amazing how the issues of the 1980 election are very similar to what they are today," he said, recalling the record-high inflation back then and the Iran hostages.

"We were a nation in decline. That's what they told us. Ronald Reagan came along and said, 'No, we're not a nation in decline . We're going there.' And we followed him," Quaid said, pointing upward. "The same with Trump, with President Trump. My favorite president of the 21st century.

"I'm gonna ask you a question that Reagan asked America back then, and I think it's the question that got him elected. Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Quaid said.

"So, like I said, people, it's time to pick a side. Who are you going to pick? God bless you," Quaid added.

Kid Rock

Kid Rock has been a proud supporter of Donald Trump for years.

In July, the rock star performed at the Republican National Convention just ahead of Trump's speech.

For his performance, Kid Rock redid his 2000 song, "American Bad A--," to include references to Trump. He began by asking the audience to stand and raise a fist before leading it in chants of "Fight, fight!" and "Trump, Trump!"

One notable lyric change happened toward the end of the song. Instead of singing the original line of "Smell the aroma, check my hits / I know it stinks in here ‘cause I’m the s---," he sang, "I know it stinks in here ‘cause Trump's the s---," censoring himself on the last word.

He finished his performance by saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the most patriotic American bada-- on Earth, President Donald J. Trump." Kid Rock then introduced UFC CEO and President Dana White , who spoke immediately before Trump gave his speech.

During his own speech, Trump spoke about Kid Rock, saying the rapper had called him and asked him if he could be involved with the convention.

"He became a friend of mine over the last ten years, and he's amazing," Trump said. "Everyone loves him. I didn't even know how big he was."

Hulk Hogan

WWE legend Hulk Hogan has long been a supporter of Trump.

Hogan first spoke at the Republican National Convention in July before taking the stage again at Trump’s massive Madison Square Garden rally in New York City in October to address the "Trumpamaniacs" in the crowd.

Hogan criticized Harris for sounding as though she’s reading from a Hollywood script during her speeches. Hogan said Harris was responsible for the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and inflation and that she acted like "she’s the victim."

"All of a sudden, she flips, she flops, she spins and turns around and acts like she was going to be the damn hero," said Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea. "But we all know Trump is the only man that can fix this country today, and with Trump as our commander in chief, peace through strength will fix all of our problems in the Middle East."

Zachary Levi

During an appearance on SiriusXM’s "The Megyn Kelly Show" this week, Zachary Levi explained why he's enthusiastically backing Trump.

"I’m not voting for Donald Trump," Levi said. "I’m voting for Donald Trump and Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk and JD Vance, and everyone else that they’re going to bring in."

In September, during Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Reclaim America Tour," Levi said, "I did want to just give you a little context why Shazam is standing here talking to you about these various things. I grew up in my family, Christian conservative — that was pretty much kind of the lane that we were in.

"My parents were Kennedy Democrats that then turned into Reagan Republicans," he continued. "And they taught me to have a healthy level of distrust for the government and a healthy level of distrust for industry that runs amok. And for a long time, I was like, ‘Man, I really want to find a politician that represents all of the things that I want and I want to see in a presidential candidate.’ And, this year, I found Bobby Kennedy. And I thought, This guy — this guy’s it. He’s the real deal.'

"In a perfect world, and whatever that would look like, perhaps I would have voted for Bobby," he added. "But we don’t live in a perfect world. In fact, we live in a very broken one. We live in a country that has been hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place way off the cliff. And we’re here to stop that, right?

"We’re here to make sure that we are going to take back this country. We are going to make it great again. And we are going to make it healthy again," Levi concluded. "And so I stand with Bobby, and I stand with Tulsi and I stand with everyone else who is standing with President Trump. Because I do believe that of the two choices we have, and we only have two, Donald Trump — President Trump — is the man that can get us there. And he’s going to get us there, because he’s going to have the backing, and the support, and the wisdom, and the knowledge and the fight that exists in Robert Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard."

Rob Schneider

In August, comedian Rob Schneider urged "Robert Kennedy Jr. supporters and American Citizens" to support former President Trump.

Schneider took to social media to post a lengthy message that said, "Dear Fellow Robert Kennedy Jr. supporters and American Citizens, as we have seen this week, ONCE AGAIN the Democratic Party is NOT running on any ideas to make American’s lives better, they are once again running on the hatred of one individual, Donald J Trump," Schneider wrote.

"And they are hoping that YOU will HATE him so much that you will forget about the Democrat’s FOREVER WARS that are pushing the world closer to World War III," he continued. "They are hoping that you forget about your grocery bills being 26% higher since Biden/Harris took office.

"The Democrats CALLED TRUMP ‘HITLER’ and half the CITIZENS of our country ‘MAGATS’ and DEPLORABLES, INCITING HATRED AND THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF A FORMER PRESIDENT," the comedian added.

"As a fellow American Citizen and Robert Kennedy Jr. supporter, I hope that you will OPPOSE TYRANNY and join us and VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," Schneider wrote, concluding his message with an image of the American flag.

Lee Greenwood

Country singer Lee Greenwood has long voiced his support for Trump as president.

During the Republican National Convention, Greenwood sang his signature "God Bless the USA" and later took to Instagram to voice his support for the former president.

"My first time singing for an American president was in 1984 at the RNC Convention for Ronald Reagan. Forty years later, I was honored to sing for another charismatic and powerful president, Donald J. Trump! Thank you President Trump for fighting so hard for this country. It was a privilege to sing for you this week. Thank you @realdonaldtrump for mentioning our friendship, I am proud to be your friend and you make me proud to be an American!" he captioned his post at the time.

Chris Janson

During the 2024 RNC, Janson and the Nashville-based band Sixwire performed for attendees by performing Aldean's "All American Guy."

Janson also performed at the 2016 RNC, singing Tim McGraw's classic "Truck Yeah."

Brian Kelley

Brian Kelley released a song in July titled, "Make America Great Again," which was a nod to Trump's slogan over the last several years.

After the attempted assassination of the former president, Kelley decided to release his song, he announced on Instagram at the time.

"I wrote this song by myself on 7/7/24 just about a week before the failed assassination attempt on @realdonaldtrump and after processing that event and being fed up with the current state of America I decided I need to get this out ASAP," he captioned his post on July 19.

"I wrote it from the heart because I am a concerned, real American. I do not pander, and I will never waver. I’m proud to honor my voice, and give a voice and anthem to those who feel the exact same way. Stand up with me. Make America Great Again out next Friday 7/26. I ask one thing of everyone on here, no matter what side you fall on or in the middle, Let’s be respectful," Kelley concluded at the time.

In another post, Schneider gave a shout-out to Trump's interview with Joe Rogan for his podcast. He praised Rogan for his "unbiased interview" with the former president.

"You rock! Thanks also to President Trump for the open and honest answers to sone very tough questions. This is what journalism SHOULD be all about," he captioned the post.

Changing leaves, the World Series, Halloween, the New York City Marathon. Then, in a blink, Election Day. The classic quadrennial late-fall cycle in America.

Now it’s the final stretch, the final sprint. The race currently seems so tight, it is impossible to predict with confidence who will win, or what ultimately will be the deciding factors for the voters. Yet in a few short days, we will likely know the answer. Then Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah , Christmas, New Year’s, and at last, Inauguration Day. On January 20, 2025, the next POTUS will take office. Former President Donald Trump may return to the West Wing, or we may greet President Kamala Harris as Number 47.

Harris, in her brief race to the White House, has achieved many impressive feats. In a blast of summer joy, she energized the Democratic Party. She held court over thousands of citizens in jam-packed rallies around the country. She looked both confident and glam at the debate against Trump. She raised over a billion dollars in support, grandly outpacing Trump’s own imposing fundraising effort. Millions of Americans will enthusiastically cast their ballot for the vice president.

NOVEMBER SURPRISE: DISMAL JOBS REPORT GIVES TRUMP LAST-MINUTE POLITICAL AMMUNITION TO FIRE AT HARRIS

If Harris wins, there would be celebration in the blue streets, excitement about the historic first female American president, and hope that Harris would bring to the Oval Office a refreshing mix of energy, leadership, unity and smart new ideas.

There would, of course, be those who would worry about her habit of creating toxic workplaces for notoriously discontented staffers; her long-running failure to stem the influx of migrants at the southern border; her largely unpopular stance on transgender issues, and the uncertainty still surrounding many of her key positions and international steel. Others would be more generous and encourage their fellow Americans to give Harris a chance to acclimate to the top job and take her shot at becoming one of the greats.

Meanwhile, there would be complicated feelings on the other side. Trump voters would be disappointed, crushed, angry, stoic, resigned, disruptive, or, perhaps, sanguine. Some might blame a blatantly biased press, electoral mischief, Trump derangement syndrome, or the candidate himself for being too chaotic, too volatile, too rhetorically undisciplined, too past his prime.

Most red voters, however, would get on with the business of their lives, even as they proudly wear their MAGA hats and buy Trump buttons and other vintage merch to pass down to their grandchildren. They would continue to vote Republican and keep a close eye on the likely party majority in the Senate, along with JD Vance, Nikki Haley, and any MAGA candidates Trump chooses to support.

But for the blue voters, if Harris loses the election and Trump returns to the White House, there would be a seismic, convulsive uproar of angst and censure within the Democratic Party that would resonate from coast to coast. There would be much to blame, and many to blame, and the accusations would be flung far and wide, with fury and fervor.

The first person to be placed in the dunking machine would be … not Kamala Harris, but President Joe Biden. For staying in the race too long, only leaving when it was indefensible for him to continue after his disastrous June debate. For running for president back in 2020, when it was clear to some that his mental acuity was already in decline, and that the prospect of a long-term presidential career was untenable. For blocking other viable Democrats from running, curbing the growth and potential of his party’s future leadership. For picking Harris as his running mate for crass demographic reasons, and for covering up unsavory truths about his family, especially his son, Hunter. For choosing self-interest and vanity over country, putting an egotistical desire to remain in power over the needs of the party and the nation.

Even those who might dispute these claims, and argue that Biden was acting with integrity and fortitude when he ran in 2020 and 2024, convinced he was the only person who could beat Trump (which may be proven correct this go-round, despite his deterioration), would lay some of the debris at Biden’s feet.

Second in line for blame would be Harris. For taking that summer burst of joy and hope and mangling it with word salads and a refusal to answer basic questions or properly prepare for and perform at important interviews.

For declining to clarify her most fundamental policy positions; for not sending sufficient signals to the center of the electorate that she understands where her party has gone too far; for not mastering the politics of appeal to Hispanics, young Black men, or Arab-, Muslim-, and Jewish-Americans; and for inexplicably maintaining an unusually light schedule for a young, hale candidate unfettered by funding issues or a pandemic. And, if she loses Pennsylvania, for not having the fortitude and clarity to choose the Keystone State’s popular Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate.

Next, blame would be placed on a liberal agenda, one that wandered off the smooth, paved road of enlightenment, stumbled through the weeds, and then tangled itself in the brambles of extreme, almost irrational, thought, causing even yellow dog Democrats to get a little orange.

Some Democratic voters, astonished and bewildered, say they no longer recognize the party they grew up with, while many loyal donors are on full alert that their funds would someday be responsible for allowing young children to unwittingly have their genders reassigned or the Middle East to be fully controlled by terrorist groups.

Alternatively, and contradictorily, blame also would be cast by the AOC wing of the party, who would charge that their fellow Democrats have in fact been too meek, lacking the conviction to push boldly and decisively into a new era of full-blown progressive change and populist economics.

In addition to blame, there would be a profound reckoning about how the Democratic Party lost its mainstream appeal. Once it offered a home to a wide spectrum of voters (fiscal conservatives, progressives, bipartisan moderates, lefties) while embracing classic American tenets such as tolerance, free speech, patriotism and a global helping hand. There was a tangible pride in its representation of the old and the young, the well-heeled and the up-and-coming, the patriarchs and the new arrivals.

Now it is fragmented and disordered, plagued by infighting, resentment and second-guessing, resembling a dog with a flea on its tail, chasing itself, circling, biting, without calm or cohesion, or a fresh mainstream policy agenda. And, of course, as much as Democrats are loath to admit it, or even think about it, Trump has taken advantage of their move to the far left to take more of the ground in the political center than they could have ever imagined.

In the past, when faced with setbacks, the Democratic Party has found ways to right itself, correct course and learn from its mistakes, unquestionably with assists from generational political talents such as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who were able to synthesize the critiques, move the party back into a zone of health and inspire confidence from leaders and civilians on both sides of the aisle after a White House loss.

Clinton, in particular, along with other party thinkers at the Democratic Leadership Council, made an effort to appeal to all Americans after a string of presidential campaign losses culminating in Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis’ defeat at the hands of President George H.W. Bush.

Clinton took stances both bold and nuanced on policies such as right to work, welfare reform, the death penalty and free trade, positions that were a shock to many on the far left, but that reflected an effort to understand the other side and speak to all citizens as a united entity. He gave his party a new, winning direction, a path they largely stayed on until the rise of Biden and Harris.

But for the blue voters, if Harris loses the election and Trump returns to the White House, there would be a seismic, convulsive uproar of angst and censure within the Democratic Party that would resonate from coast to coast. There would be much to blame, and many to blame, and the accusations would be flung far and wide, with fury and fervor.

But in 2024, the Democrats are in far deeper denial about their party’s identity than they have been in the modern era. How far left it has gone, how unstable and unreliable many perceive it to be, How and why Trump has dominated American politics for a decade and counting.

If Kamala Harris wins, she would step into the role as president for all Americans, a responsibility she undoubtedly is qualified to undertake. The Democratic Party, then, would have some breathing space to figure out how to create its own comprehensive appeal, and determine a viable path for the future of the brand.

But if Harris loses, Democrats in Washington and around the country would have an enormous task: they would have to find a way to salvage the party and come to terms with its fractured identity and significant disillusionment from its base, all while dealing with fallout from the election, preparing for political combat against Donald Trump, and managing a collective mental health crisis from its disillusioned cohorts.

And if Harris loses, this would be the Democrats’ biggest problem: there would be zero consensus in the party about what went wrong – and thus zero consensus about what the proper solutions should be, and, therefore, zero consensus about which leaders should be empowered to bring the party back to power.

All we do know is that, under those circumstances, it almost certainly won’t be Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.
Democratic 2024 presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris blasted former President Trump and praised young voters in what was likely her final campaign speech in Georgia.

Harris spoke to supporters in downtown Atlanta on Saturday, three days before voters across the country who haven't already cast ballots head to the polls on Election Day.

"We have three days left – three days in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime – and we still have work to do," the vice president said.

She pivoted to attacking Trump just a few minutes into her roughly 22-minute speech.

"We have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who spends full time trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done. We're done with that," Harris said.

"This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better, this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance. And the man is out for unchecked power."

She later asked "young leaders" to raise their hands and lavished praise on members of Generation Z – a voting bloc that both Republicans and Democrats have fought to win over.

"I love Gen Z. I love it," Harris said. "Because, see, this generation, you are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, and tackle the climate crisis, and shape the world you inherit."

"I see your power. And I am so proud of you."

The speech mined familiar territory, with Harris repeating slogans and promises that she has already uttered on the campaign trail – as is typical of presidential candidates this close to Election Day.

She vowed to crack down on grocery price gouging, which critics have panned as attempts at price-controlling goods, and pledged to cut taxes for small businesses.

Harris also pledged to lower health care costs and accused Trump of wanting to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite his campaign already insisting that is not his policy position.

The rally also featured appearances from famed director Spike Lee, rapper 2 Chainz, and both of Georgia’s Democratic U.S. senators.

Georgia has smashed turnout records already, with more than four million people casting early in-person or absentee ballots during the early voting period from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1.

More than 50% of active voters cast ballots early, including over 700,000 people who did not vote at all in 2020.

The counties leading in terms of turnout percentage have been largely rural, Republican-leaning areas. Bluer counties like DeKalb and Fulton, however, have significantly larger populations and have outpaced the redder areas in terms of sheer numbers.

Both Harris and Trump have poured enormous resources into Georgia, a state that President Biden won by less than 1% during the previous election cycle.

Trump’s campaign criticized Harris’ visit to the Peach State in a statement on Saturday morning.

"Kamala Harris' last-ditch attempt to gaslight Georgians and distract them with out of touch liberal Hollywood elites and flashy celebrities shows how desperate she is to distract Georgians from the last four years of her failed policy agenda," said Morgan Ackley, a spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign in Georgia.

"That's why Georgians are ready to elect President Trump on Tuesday to fix our problems and fire Kamala Harris."

I wasn’t planning to write this.

Two years ago, I said I would vote for a Democrat over Donald Trump in 2024. I wrote that during a Republican primary I hoped Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would win; DeSantis had stood almost alone against COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates, forever earning my respect.

But Trump crushed DeSantis in the primary. Ever since, I have struggled over what to do in this election.

In one sense, my vote doesn’t matter. I live in New York, which Kamala Harris is sure to win. But it must matter at least a little, because many of you – a surprising number – have asked or urged me to repudiate my 2022 words and endorse Trump.

With three days left in this most brutal of campaigns, I am.

In some ways, this choice pains me.

Donald Trump’s rhetoric is vicious. His unwillingness to promise to abide by the results of Tuesday’s election is dangerous. His friendly attitude toward dictators like Vladimir Putin disheartens me. And though I hate abortion, I do not support overturning Roe v Wade .

Yet.

Yet when I pull back and consider the issues, I see:

It is the Democratic Party that stands against free speech; that forced mRNA vaccines on tens of millions of healthy adults; that opened America’s southern border until public outcry forced it closed; that supports decriminalization of drugs and "decarceration" of violent criminals; that presides over one giveaway after another to its favored interest groups; and that is willing to risk the American economy over its fears of climate change – it has, with little notice, pushed through regulations that will make gasoline-powered vehicles all but unaffordable within a decade.

What exactly does Kamala Harris stand for, if not more of the same?

That’s not a rhetorical question. I truly don’t know. But she is happy to take the endorsement of Dick Cheney, the chickenhawk warmonger who for 50 years has stood for everything wrong with American elites and American politics.

And if Donald Trump’s words have grown more vicious, he has his reasons.

In the last year, prosecutors in his former home state launched not one but two trials against him, the first aimed at bankrupting him over loans he repaid in full , the second at imprisoning him for the crime of winning in 2016 . In front of juries in Manhattan, a county that voted against Trump by nearly 9 to 1 in 2020, both succeeded.

And – though the media rarely sees fit to mention this – Trump was almost assassinated in July, under circumstances that remain somewhat murky.

In response, Trump did NOT stop campaigning.

He is working harder to win votes than he ever has, in the face of an elite media that hates him more than ever. For all his complaints about rigged elections, he wants to win this one quite badly.

So, yes, Donald Trump is angry. He has the right to be.

We ALL have the right to be. For too long, our self-appointed betters – in the media, in public health, in academia – have told us they know best. They have told us that men can be women if they just click their heels three times, that the United States is an evil nation founded mostly to protect slavery , that there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. Most of all they have tried to shut down – to cancel, to censor – anyone who disagrees.

They’ve gone too far. And with their lawfare, they have proven that they will do anything to stop the man they abhor.

So I will be voting for Donald Trump.

It is not an easy choice – not for me, anyway – but it is the only choice.
During an appearance on FNC’s “The Story,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) dismissed claims by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign that Republicans wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act based on his remarks caught on video.

According to Johnson, the campaign was acting out of desperation.

“Obviously, this has become an issue over the past 24 hours based on an exchange that you had where a questioner said, no Obamacare,” host Martha MacCallum said. “And you responded, no Obamacare. The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work and we have a lot of ideas on how to do that. You want to respond to the way you’re portrayed in that ad and what you said two days ago, I believe?”

“Yes, Kamala Harris herself this afternoon said, I wanted to repeal the ACA,” Johnson said. “It’s nonsense. That’s not what I said. We have the full tape and the transcript, the audio of what was said at that setting in Pennsylvania. What we were talking about is we are on a continual quest to lower the cost of health care for people, to protect those with preexisting conditions. That’s all a very important provision of the law, but to expand access to care and the quality of care. Every member of Congress should be committed to that. That’s what I was talking about.”

“They’re lying,” he continued. “This is what people in a flailing campaign do. Kamala Harris is lying about Donald Trump. She’s lying about me and our positions and things that I’ve said. And of course, Pat Ryan is lying about Alison here. That’s what they do because they can’t run on their policies. They can’t run on their record. They have to run on these falsehoods. And I think people can see through that. The American people are very smart. I’m very bullish about the election in five days, Martha, and I’m convinced that Donald Trump’s going to be elected president. We’re going to take back the Senate, and I believe we’re going to grow the House majority because we have extraordinary people like Alison out here with us that are going to make this happen.”

A Georgia voter named Leonardo said on Friday that he cast his ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris out of concern that her supporters would struggle mentally if former President Donald Trump defeats her.

Journalist Mark Halperin recently told Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson that he believes a Trump victory would trigger a historic “mental health crisis.” Leonardo, on Halperin’s 2WAY platform, said he agreed with the journalist and voted for Harris as a result, despite not describing himself as a supporter. (RELATED: ‘You Have Changed’: Harris Faces Brutal Grilling On Flip-Flops, Border Crisis In 60 Minutes Interview)

WATCH:

“The reason I ended up voting for Harris was I saw your concern that you expressed on Tucker about the mental health crisis that could come with a Trump victory. And, you know, I’m in media sales,” Leonardo said. “I’m in New York every other month; my girlfriend’s a lawyer, and I see what you’re saying, and it genuinely concerns me because the resilience of the average Trump voter, I believe, is higher than the resilience of the average Harris voter.”

Halperin expressed agreement and asked Leonardo to elaborate.

“For example, I have a colleague who’s a lawyer, and he’s like a 30-year-old guy who has a girlfriend or wife, and he just — I think what you mentioned specifically is alcoholism. And I’ve seen the amount of alcohol that’s being ingested by him and other people like him, that are professionals — you know, lawyers, accountants — has risen with the intensity of the election,” the voter said. “And I’m not faulting them for it. I’m not mad at them or anything like that.”

“But all I’m saying is, I think that the resilience of the Trump voter would protect a lot of the jobs that they do, but I don’t know if we can really handle a country where, you know, the lawyers and the doctors and the accountants literally cannot function,” he continued. “And it wasn’t like that the last four years, but it could be like that this year. It seems like they’re a lot more intense this time around.”

Leonardo also disclosed that while he voted for Harris, he supported Republicans down the ballot.

“If this is the figurehead that will hurt about, I’d say, 30% of the country — maybe our professionals — and they will get hurt mentally from this, okay, we can give them that,” he said. “And the best you could hope for is divided government as long as things move on.”

Trump currently leads Harris slightly in five of the top seven battleground states, while the vice president only holds slim leads in Michigan and Wisconsin, according to the RealClearPolling averages. Halperin said earlier on Friday that Harris’ only viable path to an Electoral College victory may be to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as she trails Trump in the Sun Belt swing states.

A law originally intended to protect black voters in the late 19th century is now a “powerful weapon” for the Biden administration to target its political opponents, one legal expert told the Caller.

The law is often wielded by the Biden-Harris Department of Justice (DOJ) to target pro-lifers protesting abortion clinics, the Daily Caller first reported. Last year, the Conspiracy Against Rights charge was levied against Douglass Mackey for a 2016 social media post and former President Donald Trump over January 6.

“I was not aware of the Biden-Harris DOJ’s abuse of this harsh conspiracy against rights statute in these other contexts, but I am not surprised,” Stephen Crampton, Senior Counsel with the Thomas More Society, told the Caller in a statement.

Douglass Mackey, known online as “Ricky Vaughn,” was charged with election interference by the Biden-Harris DOJ in 2021. The DOJ alleged in a press release that he illegally used social media to “deprive” citizens of their right to vote during the 2016 presidential election.

The charge stemmed from a complaint filed in Brooklyn which alleged Mackey “conspired” with other individuals to encourage supporters of Hillary Clinton to “vote” with text or on social media. One post stated: “Avoid the Line. Vote from Home,” and “Text ‘Hillary’ to 59925.”

Mackey was convicted of the Conspiracy Against Rights charge in 2023 and sentenced last October to seven months in prison.

“Given its expansive interpretation by the courts in years past, it has become a powerful weapon with which this corrupt administration can bludgeon its political opponents and instill fear in all who dare oppose them,” Crampton told the Caller.

Mackey received a bond by an appeals court and has not yet gone to prison, he stated in a Twitter post.

The Conspiracy Against Rights charge was originally a part of the Enforcement Acts passed between 1868 and 1870, according to the DOJ. Most of the legislation was repealed in 1894, but section 241 and 242 of 18 U.S.C. survived. The law was originally intended to protect recently-enfranchised black voters, according to Reuters. The Enforcement Acts are also colloquially known as the “KKK Acts.”

The law prohibits two or more people from “[conspiring] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person” from exercising their Constitutional rights. The charge carries hefty fines and up to ten years in prison.

The Caller reached out to the DOJ but has not heard back at the time of publication.

“The Biden Justice Department is now using this [charge] against other political enemies,” Mackey wrote in his “Meme Defense Fund.” (RELATED: Stream the Daily Caller’s documentary “Rigged” HERE)

Mackey’s case specifically has been pointed to as an example of politically motivated lawfare.

Individuals including Mackey noted that Jimmy Kimmel recently told his viewers that Trump voters should “vote very late” and on “Thursday or maybe Friday.”

(RELATED: Jack Smith’s Use Of Obstruction Law Limited By Supreme Court ‘Fatally Undermines’ Case, Trump Attorneys Argue)

One of these counts included the Conspiracy Against Rights charge. The federal government alleged Trump violated the statute by “[conspiring] against the right to vote and to have one’s counted.”

The complaint claims that Trump “targeted a bedrock function” of the federal government. He was also charged with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding.

Biden’s DOJ has a history of using the Conspiracy Against Rights law to enhance sentences.

Americans hoping for an economic rebound in the waning months of 2024 under the Biden-Harris administration did not receive the news they were hoping for on Friday.

According to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy only added 12,000 nonfarm payroll jobs during October. The nation’s unemployment rate remained “essentially unchanged” at 4.1 percent.

The agency detailed how “[e]mployment continued to trend up in health care and government” sectors, while job losses were reported in the “help services” sector. The manufacturing industry also experienced a decline in job numbers, which BLS attributed to “strike activity.”

According to Fox Business, the 12,000 total is “well below the 113,000 gain that was predicted by LSEG economists and the lowest tally since December 2020.”

Equally notable, however, is the agency’s revelation that the total number of nonfarm payroll jobs for August and September were less than originally reported. According to BLS, August’s total “was revised down by 81,000, from +159,000 to +78,000, and the change for September was revised down by 31,000, from +254,000 to +223,000.”

“With these revisions, employment in August and September combined is 112,000 lower

[nonfarm payroll jobs] than previously reported,” the agency concluded.

The Biden-Harris administration’s downward revision of job totals is not a new phenomenon. Results from an annual analysis by BLS published in August revealed that the U.S. economy added 818,000 fewer jobs from March 2023 to March 2024 than originally reported.

October’s jobs numbers present an increasing problem for Kamala Harris ahead of Tuesday’s presidential election. Since becoming the Democrat nominee, the vice president has failed to differentiate herself from President Joe Biden and the policies enacted under their administration, and she has regularly touted the party’s “Bidenomics” economic agenda.

While speaking with CNN’s Dana Bash in August, for example, Harris declared that she was “very proud” of the administration’s policies driving the country’s economic crisis. The comments came the same month The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd reported that “[b]asic goods and services cost at least 20 percent more now than they did when [Joe] Biden and Harris first entered the White House.”

It’s worth noting that, contrary to Biden’s repeated claims, many of the jobs “created” under his and Harris’ tenure are not new jobs, but those recovered following the Covid lockdowns.

The Biden-Harris administration and Democrat litigators appear to be jointly executing a lawfare assault against the integrity of our elections. In the face of this onslaught, will Americans’ voting rights be sustained?

If an Oct. 30 ruling is any indication, it appears the Supreme Court at least may be willing to step into the breach in defense of our republic — a hopeful harbinger amid an expected flurry of 2024 election-related litigation.

In a 6-3 ruling, with the court’s three most leftist justices dissenting, the court issued an order striking down a preliminary injunction backed by the Biden-Harris Justice Department thereby protecting Virginia’s effort to remove more than 1,500 self-identified noncitizens from the voter rolls. In so doing, the court delivered a shot across the bow of a DOJ in effect laboring to protect the non-rights of non-Americans to interfere in our elections and the federal judges who had validated the administration’s efforts.

At issue in the case is the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and its regulations for removing voters from the rolls, about which lower courts have issued conflicting opinions.

Colloquially known as the “Motor Voter Act,” the bill aimed to increase the number of “eligible citizens” who register to vote in federal elections, while “protect[ing] the integrity of the electoral process” and “ensur[ing] that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.”

Section 7 of the NVRA lays out requirements for cleaning the voter rolls. It stipulates that authorities may remove registrants from eligible voter lists should they ask to be removed, be convicted of a crime, end up mentally incapacitated, or change residence. The bill dictates that authorities maintain a so-called quiet period within 90 days of federal elections, narrowing these removal efforts. During this time, authorities may not implement “systematic” voter removal programs, nor may they remove from the rolls those who change their residence.

The rationale for the provision is that it prevents states from mass-removing voters based on allegedly crude computerized identification-matching exercises that risk wrongly removing eligible voters from the rolls with insufficient time to correct errors before elections.

Enter Virginia’s program to keep noncitizens off the voter rolls, which it executed within the three months leading up to Nov. 5. Pursuant to state law, the commonwealth’s Department of Motor Vehicles sends a monthly list of all those self-identifying as noncitizens in transactions with the agency to Virginia’s Department of Elections.

The department transmits such information to relevant local registrars, who conduct a “manual, person-by-person verification” to confirm individuals identified by the state’s DMV as noncitizens match names residing on the voter rolls, according to court filings. The registrars then contact implicated individuals via mail, giving them a couple of weeks to attest to their citizenship and maintain their eligible voter status, before sending a final cancellation notice.

Still, the state’s voter registration processes serve as a fail-safe, allowing anyone wrongly removed from the rolls to reregister and vote through Election Day, according to the state.

In August, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order directing the commonwealth’s DMV to increase the cadence of information-sharing with its elections department by providing a daily list of those identifying as noncitizens. It also conducted an “ad hoc review” of DMV records over the prior year to identify other potential noncitizens on the rolls, in the form of those indicating they were U.S. citizens in interactions with the agency but who presented conflicting legal presence documentation.

Despite the fact that Virginia undertook these activities pursuant to a 2006 law precleared by the Justice Department — activities executed without issue historically, including within 90 days of prior elections — the Biden-Harris Justice Department and like-minded private plaintiffs cried foul. They filed separate suits contending Virginia’s program violated the NVRA’s quiet period provision.

The cases were consolidated into one and heard by an Eastern District of Virginia trial judge, who ordered a preliminary injunction halting Virginia’s efforts. A three-judge panel at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the ruling. Under the injunction, the commonwealth would have to return the noncitizens to the rolls — a population that could not vote without committing a felony — just days out from Nov. 5.

The Arguments

So Virginia took its case to the Supreme Court, where the commonwealth marshaled three particularly strong arguments for why its efforts to remove noncitizens from the rolls were lawful and the court ought to stay the injunction.

The first argument was that relevant provisions of the NVRA do not apply to noncitizens. The NVRA’s voter removal regulations, including during the so-called quiet period, govern “eligible applicants” who become “registrants.” But noncitizens’ registrations, the state argued, “were void ab initio” — illegitimate and therefore invalid from the start.

“If a person cannot become a ‘registrant’ because he is not and cannot be an ‘eligible applicant,’ then he cannot become a ‘voter,’” the state argued. “And if the person is not a ‘voter,’ eligible or otherwise, then he is not protected under the Quiet Period Provision.”

Conversely, Virginia suggested that by the Biden-Harris administration’s logic, if noncitizens — a class of individuals never referenced in the relevant section of the NVRA — are protected under the quiet period provision, then this implies they are “registrants.” And since “registrants” can only be removed from the rolls on prescribed grounds such as death or criminal conviction, “then the NVRA [would] bar[] States from removing noncitizens from its rolls at any time.”

This struck the commonwealth as absurd.

It contended that “the NVRA does not prohibit the removal from the voter rolls of persons, such as noncitizens and minors, who were never ‘eligible applicant[s]’ and thus could not become ‘registrant[s]’ or ‘voters’ in the first place.”

The quiet period provision, it added, “does not prohibit removing from the rolls persons who never could have validly registered in the first place.” Therefore, Virginia concluded, “States are free to systematically remove noncitizens, as well as minors and fictitious persons, at any time, including within 90 days of an election.”

Virginia’s second key argument was that its process for removing noncitizens was not systematic but rather individualized. The process, the commonwealth argued, is predicated on an individual attesting to his noncitzenship, a registrar manually matching that individual to the voter rolls, and a registrar corresponding directly with the individual before removing him.

While the lower courts emphasized that comparisons of electronic databases evinced that Virginia’s efforts were “systematic,” the commonwealth countered that “the use of electronic tools in a larger process does not automatically make the process ‘systematic,’ particularly where, as here, the process involved several layers of individualized review and contact with each person.”

“Indeed, if merely using a computerized database is enough to render a process ‘systematic,’ then nearly every modern process would qualify,” Old Dominion quipped.

Third, Virginia claimed the feds’ effort to combat its voter removal process represents an unconstitutional encroachment.

“This Court has made clear that the ‘Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them,’” the commonwealth argued, citing the 2013 Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council case. “[F]orcing States to keep noncitizens on their voter rolls would cross the line into regulating ‘who’ may vote in federal elections.”

We Need Answers

While the Supreme Court’s staying of the preliminary injunction imposed on Virginia may indicate it concurs with these arguments, the court did not rule on the case’s merits and remained silent even on its rationale for granting the stay.

Consequently, states, Virginia argued, remain “unaware of when, or whether, they can remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. They need to know with certainty whether they can remove noncitizens at any point, only outside of the Quiet Period, or never.”

Election authorities deserve answers, and hopefully the court will ultimately take up the Virginia case and provide them. Similar questions are likely to abound for the court in cases to come concerning virtually every aspect of the 2024 election.

In 2020, it chose to punt on the most critical such case — to our great detriment. Let us hope that the court’s action in the Virginia case illustrates a new resolve for the court to grapple with such pivotal matters this time around.

Right-of-center fiscal experts hope that, if former President Donald Trump wins the election, his proposed government efficiency commission will improve federal data collection practices and cut wasteful spending, but worry that doing so could spur resistance in Congress and the administrative state.

Trump announced in September that he would establish an agency to evaluate government efficiency and tap billionaire supporter Elon Musk to head it. Musk later dubbed the proposed commission the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Experts who spoke with the DCNF were largely optimistic about DOGE, highlighting the large sums of improper payments disbursed by federal agencies and general bureaucratic redundancies.

“At the end of the day, I truly think the thing that’s been missing for decades is that really granular data,” Richard Stern, director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation, told the DCNF. “You see what [Musk] did with Twitter, right? It’s not really that he went to Twitter and got rid of functionality. It’s that he literally sent people around and figured out that they could reduce the workforce by 85 percent, restructure the workforce and produce, actually, more product.” (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

Despite slashing the vast majority of the social media platform’s workforce, X under Musk has seen its average number of daily active users grow slightly and introduced an array of new features ranging from job postings to revenue sharing with users.

According to Stern, a possible second Trump administration could use data collected on agencies to similarly purge low-performing government employees or programs with minimal impact on the services currently provided to Americans.

“There’s almost certainly an enormous amount of wasted resources, office supplies, labor hours, workers, but my point is no one actually has that data,” he said. “No one has actually gone around and been in a position to really get that kind of fine grained data on exactly how much kind of lack of productivity there is, how much complete waste there is of mostly workers and labor hours or other resources.”

The federal government employs over 2 million civilian personnel, costing taxpayers about $271 billion during the 2022 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Stern pointed out conservatives have long worked to get information like this from the bureaucracy.

“There have been attempts in Congress for many years to get a firm accounting of the number of federal programs and the real details about the programs, how many workers there actually are for a program, what they do with their time, what kind of work they’re engaged in, where grants go, all that stuff,” he continued. “What has actually happened every single time is the bills never get passed because at the end of the day, the bureaucrats come out and say, we quite literally couldn’t comply with this.”

He went on to speculate that Trump could circumvent Congress and demand this data from federal agencies unilaterally.

Chris Edwards, the Kilts Family Chair in Fiscal Studies at the Cato Institute, diverged from Stern by arguing that Trump’s commission should not focus on increasing the efficiency of government programs, but rather on eliminating them.

“The main problem with the federal government is that it tries to do too much — too many things that are properly state, local, and private responsibilities,” Edwards told the DCNF. “Federal programs are hugely inefficient — but that’s because the government is so massive that members of Congress don’t have time to do real oversight on programs and prune the worst ones. So program elimination needs to come first, then we can make remaining programs more efficient.”

Edwards said the primary target of this reduction effort should be programs that provide federal aid to state programs, citing a 2019 study he authored which found that such programs suffer from high levels of waste, fraud and abuse. The study also argued that federal aid programs make it difficult for new, more efficient, policies to arise at the state level because federal dollars often come with conditions that force states to adopt certain standards, such as federally mandated speed limits on nationally funded highways.

Stern pointed out that cutting programs would require congressional support.

Federal assistance programs like these also contribute to the deficit, according to Edwards. In June the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government analyst, projected that the United States would run a $1.9 trillion deficit during the 2024 fiscal year, up $400 billion from the previous estimate. The national debt surpassed $35 trillion for the first time in July.

“Improper payments are another obvious area to find solutions,” Christopher Neefus, communications director of the spending watchdog group Open The Books, told the DCNF.

The Biden-Harris administration is on track to have approved over $1 trillion in improper payments, which federal guidelines define as any disbursement “made by the government to the wrong person, in the wrong amount or for the wrong reason.” Erroneous payments from the Medicaid and Medicare systems, as well as fraud in COVID-19 relief programs, have been major avenues for such waste.

In a similar vein to improper payments, Capital Research Center spokesperson Sarah Lee told the DCNF that the proposed agency should clamp down on “mission creep in the service of political goals within federal agencies,” pointing to things like federal spending on get-out-the-vote efforts. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of the Interior weighed using taxpayer funds to boost voter turnout among Native American voters, a historically Democratic demographic. The Biden-Harris State Department has also disbursed dozens of grants aimed at pushing LGBT ideology on developing nations. One such grant sought to foment “queer-feminist discourse” in Albania on the taxpayer dime.

Neefus pointed toward government payments to entities in Russia and China as well as pricey diversity initiatives that are hamstringing many government projects as potential targets of the DOGE. Similarly to Stern, he pointed toward Congress as a possible obstacle in Trump’s quest for administrative reform.

‘The [congressional] committee process always incentivizes more special spending for favored parties,” he told the DCNF. “Plenty of the Government Accountability Office’s cuts are sitting on a to-do list undone — either by Congress or by the relevant agency. How motivated will they be to make legislative and allocation decisions based on the findings? That’s really where the public comes in and needs to apply pressure.”

Trump’s effort to reign in administrative waste wouldn’t be the first such initiative in American history. President Ronald Reagan launched an effort led by private sector leaders in 1982 to review the federal government and recommend cuts to bring down waste and government inefficiency, Government Executive reported. The effort was dubbed the Grace Commission taking the name of its chairman, J. Peter Grace.

The commission ultimately made 2,500 recommendations aimed at making the government more efficient but the vast majority were never implemented, particularly those requiring action from Congress, according to Government Executive. It did succeed, however, in pushing to close unnecessary military bases and transferring the administration of airports near D.C. from federal control to a metropolitan agency.

After his work with the Reagan administration was complete, Grace went on to found Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW). Tom Schatz, current president of CAGW, told the DCNF that the federal government could save trillions by curtailing improper payments, reducing contributions to the United Nations, eliminating federal support of some state programs, reshuffling the government’s real estate portfolio, eliminating some federal subsidies, cutting back on earmarks, curbing some forms of corporate welfare and closing down the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).

The NEH and NEA have paid for programs that instruct teachers on how to integrate “queer” content into their classrooms and bankrolled media aimed at promoting feminism, transgenderism and left-of-center racial discourse, among other themes. The NEA funded a film festival in June where gay pornography was screened.

Schatz pointed out that, beyond simple cuts, pushing for the adoption of uniform technology between agencies could go a long way to improving efficiency.

“You know, when you leave the military, of course, you become a veteran,” he said. “Your health records should transfer easily from [the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs], but it doesn’t.”

Updates like these can be difficult to implement given the sheer volume of federal regulations. There are hundreds of thousands of pages worth of such rules, according to the General Services Administration.

“If something like this happens, it’s imperative that the White House follows up, puts the recommendations into their budgets and talks about it as much as possible,” Schatz continued after having warned that the DOGE could face steep resistance from entrenched bureaucrats.

Trump struck a blow against the permanent bureaucracy after Supreme Court justices he appointed made the deciding votes to overturn Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, a long-standing precedent that required courts to defer to agency interpretations of the law when the legal language was ambiguous.

The Democrats’ allied press has gone all out with yet another hoax to thwart former President Donald Trump’s return as commander-in-chief just days before the election closes. Four years ago, the media was twisting Trump’s words to suggest the president was recommending Americans inject themselves with bleach. This week, they’re manipulating his remarks to suggest a top political foe be shot.

On Thursday, Trump campaigned with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in Arizona, where the two assailed the neocon warmongers now backing Vice President Kamala Harris, including ousted Rep. Liz Cheney. Here is what Trump said about the ex-Wyoming lawmaker:

She’s a radical warhawk. Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let’s see how she feels about it, when the guns are trained on her face. They’re all warhawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, “Gee, let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,”

Here is what Aaron Rupar, one of the internet’s worst left-wing propagandists, would have voters think that Trump said:

She’s a radical warhawk. Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay?

Wow, I’m so shocked that propagandist Rupar cut it off before this line: “They're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying ‘Oh gee, let's send 10,000 troops into the mouths of the enemies.' She always wanted to go to war with people.” — Mollie (@MZHemingway) November 1, 2024

CNN picked up the narrative to accuse Trump of demanding Cheney be killed.

“He’s saying quite explicitly and unambiguously that Liz Cheney should be shot, should be executed by firing squad,” said Jonah Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Dispatch and a CNN commentator. “Let’s execute a political opponent, who happens to be a woman, because I don’t like her. … Does that pull more low-propensity voters in his coalition to the polls? I honestly don’t think so.”

"Let's execute a political opponent who happens to be a woman because I don't like her" — how @jonahdispatch KNOWINGLY lied about Trump saying Liz Cheney should have to fight in the many deadly wars she and Jonah have supported. Even for Jonah, this is a shocking debasement. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) November 1, 2024

Any honest examination of Trump’s remarks, however, reveals nothing of the sort. Trump was obviously painting a picture of Cheney being deployed to the same war zones she routinely demanded Americans be sent to in the never-ending wars of the old Republican Party. And yet, the media went hysterical, with the usual culprit outlets like Politico and The Washington Post repeating the same lie over and over that Trump dramatically called on Cheney to be terminated. Cheney and Vice President Harris would each capitalize on the media-manufactured outrage to peddle the left’s latest hoax.

“This is how dictators destroy free nations,” Cheney wrote, two years after having run the Democrats’ Soviet-style tribunal in the House to prosecute former members of the Trump administration.

“This must be disqualifying,” Harris said Friday.

Trump, however, is no stranger to Democrats and the regime media ripping words out of context to frame the Republican nominee as a deranged madman unfit for high office. The last-minute media outrage happens to come as Trump picks up late-race momentum across the polls in the final hours before Election Day.

Whether the fabricated scandal be invented admiration for white supremacists in Charlottesville (which Snopes debunked as untrue) or a purported recommendation that Americans consume bleach as a therapeutic for Covid-19 (which even PolitiFact corrected as a false narrative), there is probably no president in modern U.S. history who has faced such blatant hostility from the press delivering serial falsehoods about his remarks.

Biden would repeat the Charlottesville and bleach lies years later in his final debate with Trump, illustrating how deep each conspiracy from the press has taken root within the Democrat Party.

“Many people were dying,” Biden said in June about Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. “All he said was ‘It’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm, you’ll be alright.’”

As PolitiFact explained, however, “Trump did not specifically recommend ingesting disinfectants.”

“Nevertheless, his remarks led some companies and state agencies to issue warnings about ingesting disinfectants,” PolitiFact noted four years ago. The note further underscores how unhinged the press’s coverage of Trump’s remarks is, given that people believe Trump said something he did not.

Just like the press today, however, the media weren’t operating in a good-faith election-year effort to report on the president’s remarks accurately; they were manipulating them to mean something he obviously did not.
Donald Trump is on the cusp of an improbable comeback victory in the 2024 presidential election because the American people would not let him fail.

The campaign and its staff worked incredibly hard, and from the outside, the 2024 effort seemed to be the most well-organized, and professional, of Trump’s three attempts at the presidency.

Yet there were moments when Trump seemed to falter, and when he was lifted up by people who decided, on their own, that they would not let him lose.

Take, for example, the song “Fighter,” written by Breitbart News’ own Jon Kahn and recorded in his backyard studio.

It was written before Trump was grazed by an assassin’s bullet in July and stood up, with his fist raised. It was released the week of the presidential debate in September , when Kamala Harris was at her peak.

The song evokes the spirit of a man who never gives up, even when he is down: “‘Cause I hit harder when I’m tired.”

It soared to #1 on the charts.

Or recall the surprise announcement by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump the day after Harris was coronated at the Democratic National Convention.

Kennedy delivered a more searing indictment of Harris’s candidacy than any Republican. “Instead of showing us her substance and character, the DNC and its media organs engineered a surge of popularity for Vice President Harris based upon nothing,” he declared.

These were efforts outside the campaign that shaped its message and infused it with energy.

Similarly, grassroots activists like Scott Presler took it upon themselves to register new voters when the party, and the campaign, were moving too slowly.

My former Breitbart News colleague, Michelle Dawi (née Moons), felt the campaign was missing the chance to register Arab American voters, so she set up tables outside grocery stores in Michigan and did so.

In May, I watched the news from New York with dismay, as a Manhattan jury convicted Trump of 34 bogus felony charges. I took down the American flag outside my house and hung it upside down as a sign of distress and defiance.

But I grew tired of angry gestures and decided to do something to help. I sat at my kitchen counter on Saturday night, June 1st, and began writing a plan for Trump’s first 100 days in office. Ten days later, The Agenda was complete.

A few weeks ago, I was driving down the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica — a left-wing enclave — when, stuck in traffic, I looked up to see a black man holding a Trump 2024 sign on a pedestrian overpass.

He knew he was not going to convince most of the drivers in that neighborhood to vote Republican. But he wanted to signal to those who quietly supported Trump, or were thinking of doing so, that they were not alone, not even in deep-blue California.

Much of the story of this campaign is about Donald Trump himself — a flawed protagonist who faced unprecedented opposition and almost insurmountable challenges, some of his own making.

Win or lose, loved or hated, Trump will be remembered by history as one of America’s folk heroes, a man who refused to conform, whose personality evokes the very essence of our unique national character — brash, but brave; insufferable at times, but invincible in the end.

Yet Trump would not be where he is today had millions of Americans not stepped forward to fight for him — and even to take a bullet for him, as firefighter Corey Comperatore did on that fateful day in Pennsylvania.

Trump’s opponents misunderstand that kind of devotion as a “cult of personality.” What it is, is a spirit Trump has reminded us how to find in ourselves — a refusal to surrender, a will to dream and to reach for the impossible.

Win or lose, that spirit is here to stay.

While much has been made about 2024 election polling, the only data that truly matters in the presidential race is already looking good for Republicans.

When the Daily Caller asked Harris’ rally attendees how they felt about the 2024 elections, many said they were worried Harris would lose to Trump.

“I’m very nervous, honestly. I think Trump might win. I don’t know,” one female student from Maryland told the Daily Caller as her friend nodded in agreement.

NEW: At Harris’ closing argument the joy was high. But even at a high-energy, packed rally, some of her supporters expressed a sense of nervousness about what would happen Nov. 5 and beyond. “I think Trump might win.” Only in @DailyCaller: https://t.co/bHmYd2478s — Reagan Reese (@reaganreese_) October 30, 2024

Anything can happen between now and Nov. 5. There is no way to accurately predict who will win the presidential election. Early voting results are positive for Republicans, however, which should scare Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters.

Traditionally, Democrats lead in early voting, but the 2024 early voting data in critical states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan show just how far Republicans have come in those states.

In 2020, Democrats held a 1.1 million-vote lead in Pennsylvania, creating a massive firewall for former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates to overcome. Republicans drastically cut that lead in 2024. The most recent early voting results show that 57% of Democrats voted in 2024 so far, casting around 894,400 ballots, according to L2 DataMapping. For Republicans, close to 33% have voted, with 515,900 votes. (Democrats Working Overtime To Turn Election Conspiracies Into Reality)

PA Ballots RETURNED: Dems: 947,214 (56.1%) +29,318 from 10.31

Dem: -771,512 https://t.co/5BM9ydBA0y pic.twitter.com/IuZxdf6F1V — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) November 1, 2024

This gives Democrats just a 378,500 vote lead over Republicans, which means Democrats’ lead is down by 621,5000 votes compared to 2020. Harris won’t have the million-vote firewall that Biden had in 2020 going into Election Day.

The reason Democrats’ numbers are down in Pennsylvania is two-fold. Not only is Philadelphia underperforming for Democrats compared to 2020, but Republicans have successfully flipped five counties red in terms of voter registration, including Bucks and Luzerne County.

Republicans are currently outvoting Democrats in Arizona by 118,200 votes. In 2024, 42% of Republicans cast 672,100 ballots, while only 35% of Democrats cast 553,900 votes. Arizona’s early voting data from 2020 showed a much closer race between Democrats and Republicans. In 2020, Democrats cast 923,805 ballots, with Republicans casting 914,172 votes. Voters gave Democrats a 9,633 vote lead at this same time four years ago. Because Republicans have a much larger lead than Democrats did four years ago, Harris has an uphill climb in Arizona compared to Biden, who beat Trump by just 10,457 votes in 2020.

Democrats are also losing the early voting race in Nevada. Republicans hold a 12,800-vote lead over Democrats in the state, with 241,800 votes cast compared to Democrats’ 229,000. Compared to 2020, Democrats had a 47,000-vote lead during early voting. This marks a 53,000-vote swing to Republicans in four years.

North Carolina voters tend not to wait until Election Day to vote. In 2020, Democrats held a 260,112 vote lead over Republicans heading into Election Day. In 2024, Republicans are outvoting Democrats by 100,000 votes. Harris hoped to flip North Carolina blue in 2024 despite knowing that Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020. The early voting results indicate that he will likely win North Carolina again. (ROOKE: Republicans’ Latest Swing State Win Is The Last Thing Democrats Want Right Now)

Georgia, a critical swing state, set a record for early voting in 2024 by reaching 50% turnout Thursday. It’s harder to break down the state’s early vote records for 2020 because the data by party is hard to find. Biden, however, won Georgia by just 11,779 votes. In 2024, early voter data shows Democrats have an advantage going into Election Day, but it likely won’t be long-lived.

While female voters in Georgia are surging in early voter turnout, which is good for Harris, so are voters age 65 and older who typically vote Republican. Democrats currently have a 100,000-vote lead in early voting. Still, Republicans tend to capture most of Election Day votes, allowing Trump to close this gap as Republicans have more registered voters than Democrats in Georgia.

Michigan will likely be the closest swing state contest between Trump and Harris. It’s not a sure win for Harris, however. While Democrats have more registered voters in the state, they have just around a 200,000-vote lead over Republicans in early voting results. Democrats cast 1.3 million votes in 2020, compared to Republicans’ 1.1 million.

Unlike in 2020, Harris is not enjoying a cushy vote lead in several swing states going into Election Day, where Republicans tend to outvote Democrats. While polling can fluctuate, the only data that can accurately portray whether Harris or Trump will win is actual votes tallied. And right now, Harris is struggling in the states she needs to win Nov. 5.
Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is claiming that "voter suppression" is occurring in Georgia despite record turnout in the Peach State.

During Friday’s installment of "CNN News Central," co-anchor Kate Bolduan asked Abrams what she believes is driving the surge in early voting.

"While we are excited about who is showing up, we have to understand that turnout does not mean there is not voter suppression activity," Abrams replied.

She suggested that one of the reasons for long early voting lines is because residents can no longer use the "easier" method of voting by mail.

RURAL GEORGIA COUNTIES OUTPACE DEM STRONGHOLDS AS PEACH STATE SHATTERS EARLY VOTING RECORDS

"People who are disabled, people who have lost their homes are facing harder times casting their ballots, but they refuse to be silenced. What we are excited about is that here in the state of Georgia, despite the government making it harder to cast your ballot, people are willing to fight to make it happen anyway," Abrams continued.

Senate Bill 202, which was adopted by the Georgia General assembly in 2021, made several changes to absentee ballots. Prior to its passage, signature verification was the primary means of checking voter identity, according to the Fulton County website.

Absentee ballots could also be requested up until the Friday before the election.

The new method stipulates that Georgia voters provide their Driver’s License number or other forms of voter ID and must request their ballot at least 11 days before the election.

"Once again, Stacey Abrams is lying about Georgia’s elections, and over three million voters who have already voted know not to take her seriously," Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "She’s cost the state millions and it’s time for her to get real: Georgia has the leads the nation in voter accessibility and convenience and we run the most secure elections in the country."

Georgia voters have already shattered multiple turnout records, but that did little to temper Democratic critics of the new rules for the 2024 presidential cycle put in place by the state’s GOP officials.

"I was just in Georgia. You know they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote?" Vice President Kamala Harris told a rally crowd in Michigan earlier this week. "The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ‘love thy neighbor,’ right?"

Meanwhile, President Biden called Georgia’s election security laws "Jim Crow 2.0" in 2022.

Georgia’s Republican-majority legislature passed several laws since 2020 to increase security around the voting process after the Peach State was thrust under scrutiny in the previous presidential race.

Among them were measures to expand the ability to challenge voter eligibility, a rule limiting ballot drop boxes based on population size and, perhaps most notably, a measure forbidding political organizations from handing out food and drinks to voters waiting in line within a certain distance from a polling place.

Election workers are, however, permitted to set up self-serve water stations.

Republicans in Florida cast approximately 800,000 more ballots during early voting than Democrats as of Friday afternoon.

Election Data posted by Florida’s Voice shows that 7,090,301 people voted early and by mail as of 3:00 p.m. Republicans accounted for 44.39 percent with 3,147,542 ballots cast, while Democrats accounted for 32.78 percent with 2,323,954 ballot cast. Voters with no party affiliation accounted for 20.51 percent with 1,454,566 ballots cast.

Data shows more Republicans voted early in-person than Democrats, approximately 2.2 million to 1.2 million. Slightly more Democrats in the state opted to vote by mail, approximate 1.1 million to 948,000.

Overall, Florida turnout for the presidential election hit 50 percent of registered voters. The state has 13,845,913 registered voters in 2024, according to the Florida Division of Elections.

While Florida has been considered a swing state in the past — swinging for former President Barack Obama 2008 and 2016 only to tip Trump in 2016 and 2020 — Republicans have had a firm grip on the state in recent years, massively expanding their voter registration.

In 2024, there are one million-plus more registered Republicans than Democrats in Florida, 5,455,480 to 4,400,561, state data shows. Republicans announced leading Democrats in terms of voter registration by over one million voters less than three years after Republicans initially took the lead in November 2021.

The last time Democrats led Republicans in terms of voter registration was 2020, when there were 5,315,954 registered Democrats and 5,218,739 registered Republicans, according to state data.

A recent University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) survey released Monday further solidified this reality, showing Trump leading Harris by ten percent in the Sunshine State, garnering 53 percent support to Harris’s 43 percent support.

That same survey also showed Trump edging out Harris by one point among women and by double-digits among Hispanic voters as well.

The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Trump leading Harris by an average of 8.5 percent in the Sunshine State.

Trump took Florida by 1.2 percent — or less than 113,000 votes — in 2016 and by 3.3 percent — or less than 372,000 votes —in 2020.
Rural Georgians are voting early at a higher rate than those living in Democratic-leaning counties that were key to President Biden flipping the state blue in 2020, the most recent data show.

Of the state’s 159 counties, the top 23 for absentee and early in-person voter turnout were won by former President Trump in 2020, according to the state's elections website.

That includes the rural counties of Towns, Oconee and Rabun — which have seen 69.06%, 65.51% and 64.46% of their active voters already casting ballots, respectively.

Towns County voters outpaced the Georgia county average early turnout rate by roughly 15%, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

'ADMIRES DICTATORS': HARRIS CONTINUES COMPARING TRUMP TO HITLER DURING BATTLEGROUND STATE TOWN HALL

That includes suburban blue-leaning Cobb County and Gwinnett County, as well as the Democratic stronghold of Fulton County, home to Atlanta.

Of Fulton County’s active voters, 53.51% cast ballots before Election Day.

Georgia has smashed early voting records since early voting began on Oct. 15. On Wednesday evening, state officials announced that more than half of the state’s total active voters have already cast ballots.

Turnout in several rural areas that favored Trump is already close to total 2020 turnout, projections show.

Atlanta metro-area counties that voted for Biden are still significantly larger than rural areas with higher turnout, however.

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

Nearly 385,000 Fulton County voters cast early in-person ballots, followed by 275,207 from Gwinnett County and 271,426 from Cobb County.

By contrast, just under 7,000 Towns County residents voted in person during Georgia’s early voting period, which runs through Friday.

Regardless, the spike in early voting in rural parts of Georgia could be a sign that Trump and Republicans have been successful in their efforts to gin up enthusiasm among their base.

It also could change perceptions of the way analysts and predictors interpret voter turnout — traditionally, early voting would heavily favor Democrats while an Election Day surge could help Republicans.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Dave Wasserman, of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, noted on X that early turnout in some rural red Georgia counties was on track to match their total turnout, but said it was not necessarily an indicator of who would win.

"It's notable that a place like Towns Co. (Trump +61 in '20) is at 92% of its final '20 turnout, while Clayton Co. (Biden +71) is at 69% of its '20 turnout," he wrote on X.

"Doesn't tell us who will win GA, just that Dems have more work to do than Rs to turn out their vote in the final days."
Republicans are running an intensive, all-hands-on-deck operation to get out the vote in North Carolina, targeting low-propensity voters in the battleground state recently impacted by a disastrous hurricane, says the chair of the Republican campaign arm.

Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and represents North Carolina's 8th congressional district. He spoke with Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview on GOP efforts to ramp up early voting in the state this cycle.

"As more of our traditional voters vote, then that lets us spend our resources focused on adding more voters to the rolls or to the tally sheet and then turning them out. So it's all hands on deck. The party's bought into it. All our candidates are pushing it. And so far it's been very successful," Hudson said.

North Carolina saw record turnout on the first day of early voting in the state, Oct. 17, when 353,000 registered voters cast their ballots.

DEMS NEED TO RAMP UP EARLY VOTING EFFORTS TO MATCH GOP MOMENTUM IN NORTH CAROLINA: ANALYST

"Certainly here in North Carolina, we're seeing record turnout for Republicans," he added. "And that's good. That allows us to target lower propensity voters with our turnout efforts as we get closer to Election Day and on Election Day. And so I think it's going to be a difference maker."

Republicans have put an emphasis on encouraging voters to vote early this year after seeing lower early turnout for the party compared to Democrats last cycle. As of Friday, the North Carolina State Board of Elections reported that Republicans are leading Democrats in early voting, 55% to 51%.

BATTLEGROUND STATE VOTING DATA REVEALS OVER 200K VOTES CAST IN RED COUNTIES IMPACTED BY HURRICANE

"It's a culture change. Republicans are now really focused on early voting. We've done voter contact by knocking on people's doors, calling them on telephones. We've done it through the mail, through digital contact," Hudson said.

Hurricane Helene had a severe impact on the state, specifically across western red counties which historically vote Republican. Despite the storm, there have been successful efforts to ensure voting access for those in the impacted western counties across the state.

"It's been a real challenge, but our state legislature, I think, did the right thing and passed a law that said if you live in one of those 25 counties that were affected by the hurricane, you can vote in any of our counties," Hudson said.

The North Carolina Elections Board passed a bipartisan emergency resolution that reformed the state's early voting process in 13 counties, including changing or adding voting sites and maintaining their availability, extending the hours and adding or reducing when any site is open within the early voting period, according to the election board.

Despite roadblocks to early voting, the North Carolina Board of Elections reported that Tuesday's voter turnout in the 25 western counties affected by recent events is surpassing the statewide average.

"I know a lot of folks are staying with relatives in other parts of the state. This will allow them to cast their votes. There's also been an effort to add voting locations in those areas and to try to help people access those. There also was concern about absentee ballots being lost. And so we're trying to help get new ballots to folks that need them," Hudson told Fox. "There's an all-hands-on-deck effort. But it's a challenge because there's a lot of communities that are still cut off, a lot of people who are still missing. And it's just a real tragedy that it really is a lot more important than some of the other things."

As of Friday, about 49.32% of ballots were already cast in North Carolina for the 2024 election. In-person early voting in North Carolina ends on Saturday.
Mail-in voting is banned in many Western countries and even in war-torn countries like Ukraine.

Mail-in voting was a strong point of contention in 2020 and continues to be hot-button issue during the 2024 presidential campaign, as Democrats have embraced the voting method and conducted legal campaigns to defend it.



In March, a meme circulated online purporting to list at least eight notable countries that have banned mail-in voting.

A page from Snopes, a left-leaning "fact-check" website, quickly popped up and labeled the claim a "mixture" of truth and falsities.

However, a review of voting laws around the world reveals that many countries do, in fact, allow absentee voting for citizens who are out of the country but disallow mail-in voting for citizens who do not have a valid absentee excuse.

The alleged fact-checkers mainly leaned on absentee voting as a reason why they couldn't fully claim that mail-in voting is banned in many Western countries. As Pew Research has noted, at least 88 countries allow voting from abroad in presidential-level elections, which means that absentee voting is not a controversial topic. In fact, virtually no one in the United States challenges the right of people with a valid absentee excuse (such as overseas military service) to vote. What many have argued, however, is that those who live in the United States and are thus without an excuse for not participating in in-person voting should not be permitted to mail in their votes. And an examination of the laws in the countries in question reveals that many of them have taken exactly this position.

For example, France banned mail-in voting for in-country residents due to fraud.

Snopes claimed that the practice was ended in France due to a "few instances" of fraud, particularly on the island of Corsica. However, Snopes' source states that fraud and malfunctions in voting systems were not confined to Corsica and listed other instances.

Additionally, the list of those who could vote by mail-in ballot in France before 1975 was needlessly excessive. It included journalists who were "on the move," travelers and representatives, commercial agents, fairground traders, seasonal agricultural workers, construction workers working on sites far from their homes, people seeking medical assistance at a "spa" or "resort," and even "young people" who were at school far from their homes.

France, however, allows online voting, so long as the voter is French, resides abroad, and is properly registered.

According to Newsweek, Mexico banned absentee ballots in 1991 and mandated photo ID to vote. This came after the governing Revolutionary Party was accused of fraud and intimidation in order to garner mail-in ballots. Absentee ballots were reintroduced in 2006 only for those living abroad and only for specific elections, including the presidency.

This policy is mirrored in Belgium, where mail-in ballots are not allowed for residents in the country. However, those abroad can vote both by mail and by proxy. At the same time, some regions, including the Flemish region, are not yet allowed to vote by mail or online.

Belgium also instituted compulsory voting, which, for better or for worse, has resulted in a near-90% turnout rate. Consistent fines without justification could lead to a 10-year removal from voting registration.

Sweden has a similar system. Mail-in voting is only allowed for those abroad through mail, by courier, or through an embassy. Multiple sources make it clear that resident Swedish citizens must vote in person, with early voting up to 18 days before the election.

"Voters vote for a political party and may, at the same time, mark the candidate that they would prefer to be elected on their ballot paper with a cross," the European Union writes about Sweden.

Italy too only allows mail-in voting for those residing abroad.

Japan explains its voting process through adorable cartoons, also noting that Japanese citizens should vote in person. Certain disabilities, along with living abroad, allow for voting by mail in Japan.

Snopes points out that while Ukraine and Russia do not have mail-in voting, Ukraine hasn't had an election for several years due to the implementation of martial law.

While Ukraine does not allow mail-in votes, it does allow certain questionable practices, such as impermanent address changes.

"Citizens are able to permanently change their preferred address (which does not have to be their residence) to be assigned a more convenient polling station for both local and national elections," Snopes wrote. "For national elections, they can also ask for a temporary change of address up to five days before the vote."



While paper ballots and in-person voting are continuously decried as forms of voter suppression in the United States, it does indeed seem that by international standards, the U.S. is extremely lax in allowing mail-in voting for people who are residing in the United States.

New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers knows what's at stake on Tuesday.

During an appearance on ESPN's "The Pat McAfee Show" on Friday, one night after his team's big win over the Houston Texans, Rodgers discussed the upcoming election.

The quarterback revealed that he is now registered to vote in New Jersey. But Rodgers and the show's co-hosts also noted that Tuesday is important because of the NFL trade deadline. During the end of Rodgers' appearance, they referred to Tuesday as the "trade deadline" while discussing political issues like FEMA and financial aid to Ukraine.

While referring to that day, Rodgers appeared to take a jab at celebrities who have made endorsements this year.

"If you don’t know what to do on trade deadline, just ask your favorite celebrity," Rodgers said. "My favorite is when the celebrity is bought and paid for by China."

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

Rodgers' comment comes amid a flury of last-minute celebrity endorsements for Vice President Kamala Harris in the week leading up to the election. NBA star LeBron James and even the main cast of Marvel's Avengers films, including Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, have announced their endorsements for Harris in the last week. Pop stars like Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez have also made their stance in support of Harris very clear ahead of a historically high-stakes election day next week.

There are no notable celebrity endorsements for NFL trade deadline decisions to report.

But Rodgers didn't stop there.

He also vocally criticized the decision by the U.S. government to send billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, which has occurred under the Biden-Harris administration, while countless American citizens in the southeastern part of the country have been affected by hurricane damage in recent months.

"I don’t have a problem with Ukraine, at all, I just think there are a lot of problems in the United States that $180 billion could maybe help instead of fighting a proxy war," Rodgers said. "You know, like natural disasters, and there’s FEMA is confiscating bottles of water and food supplies from people trying to help, like maybe let’s help those people out, and obviously FEMA doesn’t have the best record when you go back to 2005 and Katrina, but I think there’s a lot of problems in the states, and there’s people hurting could use more than $600, $700."

Rodgers appeared to refer to the Biden-Harris administration's recent response to Hurricane Helene, which brought billions of dollars in property damage to Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina and parts of Florida, Tennessee and Virginia.

JETS' AARON RODGERS CREDITS 'FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH' DRINK FOR HELPING HIM GET THROUGH SHORT WEEK

The U.S. has sent $66.9 billion to Ukraine as of Oct. 21, according to the Department of State.

Meanwhile, a Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report from August stated that FEMA has $7 billion that can be directed to help with recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton , which hit the region, especially Florida, later that month. However, FEMA disputes that all the money is recoverable, signaling that only about $4.5 billion is not obligated and could potentially be reprogrammed.

But Fox News Digital previously reported that the August Inspector General report "gives an incomplete picture" of how much money is available.

Rodgers has previously criticized the Democratic Party. He dismissed the political system as a "sham" during a podcast interview from Lake Tahoe this summer. Rodgers specifically called out Hillary Clinton's infamous email scandal and the notion that the 2016 DNC primary was rigged in favor of Clinton over Bernie Sanders.

"Politics, I’ve said from the beginning, is an absolute sham. And if we’ve seen anything whether what they did to Bernie Sanders in 2016, that we saw in the (John) Podesta emails or the fact that nothing really ever changes . . . all they talk about is what they’re gonna do, and then life doesn’t actually get better for any of us – whether it’s a Republican or a Democrat. And we’re still doing the same f---ing two-party system. Not letting Bobby get in or anybody else," Rodgers said during an interview on "Pardon My Take" on July 22.

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Vice Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, also said her party's 2016 primary was "rigged" against Sanders, during an interview on CNN in November 2017.

In that same episode, Rodgers also suggested that former Democrat Speaker of The House Nancy Pelosi allegedly engages in insider trading.

Rodgers also criticized the inability of a third-party candidate to be able to get on the ballots for the election.

Kennedy failed to meet the requirements of the debate between President Biden and former President Trump, which influenced top Democratic politicians and donors to urge Biden to drop out of the 2024 race.

"We have Bobby, who doesn’t even get a chance to be in the debates. If you knew the insides of how ridiculous it is for a third-party candidate to get on the ballots in 50 states – it’s a f---ing sham," Rodgers said. "It’s certain colors in some states. There’s certain people you gotta submit it to in other states. It’s a certain amount of votes in certain states. It’s a f---ing joke."

Rodgers was floated as a potential Kennedy running mate before Kennedy ended up picking Nicole Shanahan. Rodgers admitted that he "thought about" joining Kennedy's ticket, but instead opted to "live his life."

Kennedy has since withdrawn from the race and endorsed former president Trump.
President Biden returns to the campaign trail this weekend with stops in the biggest of the battleground states, his native Pennsylvania.

The White House confirmed the president will campaign on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris and down-ballot Democrats when he makes stops Friday in Philadelphia and Saturday in Scranton, where the 81-year-old Biden was born and spent his early childhood years.

But Harris, who with four days until Election Day remains locked in a tight showdown with former President Trump in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, won't be joining her boss on the campaign trail.

HEAD HERE FOR FOX NEWS UPDATES FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TRAIL

The vice president has kept her distance from Biden, who, according to polls, remains deeply unpopular with Americans, and her campaign quietly views him as a liability. And that was before the president made two glaring remarks the past two weeks that quickly went viral.

While Harris has noted the policy successes of the Biden/Harris administration the past four years while campaigning, she's emphasized that she'll be an agent of change in the White House.

HARRIS TAKES AIM AT TRUMP, SPELLS OUT AGENDA, IN CLOSING ARGUMENT IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE CROWD

Giving her closing address Tuesday night at the Ellipse, just yards from the White House, where the president was huddled, Harris emphasized, "I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden’s vice president, but I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office."

It's been nearly two months since the one-time running mates teamed up on the campaign trail. You have to go back to Labor Day, when they joined forces at a union event in Pittsburgh.

The 81-year-old Biden was replaced by Harris atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July after ending his own bid amid a rising chorus of calls for him to drop out following a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Biden told reporters two months ago he would be "on the road from there on" campaigning on behalf of his vice president.

It hasn't happened.

And while former Democratic presidents Obama and Clinton have crisscrossed the campaign trail in recent weeks on behalf of Harris, Biden's efforts have been more limited and less publicized.

WHAT THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLS SHOW IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

While Biden hasn't done many campaign events, he has made official trips with political overtones into some of the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided his victory over Trump in 2020 and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election.

The president has showcased the administration's accomplishments at those events.

"I think they are using him in a targeted way that makes sense," a political adviser in the president's orbit told Fox News.

Last week, Biden teamed up with progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a policy event in swing state New Hampshire to spotlight their efforts to lower health care costs.

The two octogenarians trumpeted a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services that found nearly 1.5 million Medicare enrollees saved almost $1 billion on prescription drugs during the first half of the year.

But at a political event minutes later, Biden stirred controversy.

Speaking to supporters at the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters in Concord, N.H., Biden said of Trump, "We got to lock him up."

While the president instantly corrected himself, adding "politically lock him up," the damage was done.

The initial comment gave Trump instant ammunition for his argument that the four indictments against him — and one conviction — are part of an elaborate Democratic Party witch hunt. That's despite no evidence the president or his administration has played any role in Trump's prosecutions and despite Trump's repeated calls over the years to lock up his own political opponents.

Biden dug an even deeper hole Tuesday night, stepping all over the vice president's closing address with more controversial comments during a video call with Latino supporters.

Denouncing racist comments made by a comedian at Sunday's Trump rally in New York City that had dominated news coverage for a couple of days, Biden appeared to call supporters of the former president "garbage."

Biden tried to clean up the mess, saying he was referring to the "hateful rhetoric" from the Trump rally comedian and not to the former president's supporters in general.

But the Trump campaign and allies immediately pounced, and Biden's comments dominated the news cycle two straight days.

Harris on Wednesday morning disavowed any idea of disparaging Trump supporters.

She noted that Biden had "clarified his comments," adding, "Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for."

Even before the Biden remarks, Harris was walking the tight rope that previous vice presidents running for the top job have faced, trying to balance support for the boss and advertising the administration's achievements while also spotlighting a forward-looking message and showing how they'd be different.

"This election is about Kamala Harris, so people need to see the vision that she has for America. … It's important that the focus stay on her," veteran New Hampshire-based Democratic strategist and Harris convention delegate Jim Demers told Fox News.

But Demers, who has also been a longtime Biden supporter and surrogate, noted that "you're not going to hold Joe Biden back from being on the campaign, and, in the final days, it's good to see him out there urging people to vote for Kamala Harris."
On Thursday’s broadcast of WBUR’s “Here and Now,” Managing Director of the Immigration Defense Unit at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office Francisco Ugarte stated that if 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is elected the “idea that Trump could just simply get away with engaging in mass deportation without any semblance of a resistance is really kind of far-fetched.” And cited California’s Supreme Court saying that ICE agents shouldn’t be in courthouses because that deters people from going to court as an example of this.

Ugarte said, “They did try and do courthouse arrests. But, when they sent ICE agents, one time, to the local courthouse here in San Francisco, within a day, there was a massive rally of community members and a declaration from the Supreme Court…of California saying, don’t invade the space of the courts, because you’ll deter people from going to courts. So, this idea that Trump could just simply get away with engaging in mass deportation without any semblance of a resistance is really kind of far-fetched. Things like mass deportation or these, like, sweeping human rights abuses are really, ultimately, not very popular among the American public.”

When former President Donald Trump criticized former Rep. Liz Cheney for trying to push Americans into war, the legacy media rushed to her defense, twisting Trump’s words to make it seem like he was threatening her with a firing squad.

“She’s a radical warhawk. Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let’s see how she feels about it, when the guns are trained on her face. They’re all warhawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, ‘Gee, let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,’” Trump said Thursday at a campaign event with Tucker Carlson.

Clearly, Trump was saying Cheney wants to send Americans to die in overseas wars. He pointed out she — and other D.C. elites in the military-industrial complex — would never put themselves in the positions they are placing the nation’s soldiers.

“I’d have meetings with a lot of people, and she always wanted to go to war with people,” Trump said.

But legacy media, in typical style, cherry-picked Trump’s comments to make it seem he — not Cheney — was inciting violence.

“Trump uses violent rhetoric to attack ‘war hawk’ Liz Cheney,” reads a headline from Good Morning America. The host attacked Trump and applauded Harris during Friday morning’s show.

She said Trump was using “increasing dark and violent rhetoric against his political rivals … even suggesting former House Republican leader Liz Cheney, who has endorsed Kamala Harris, be put in the line of fire.” Meanwhile, another headline from the show said Harris held a “star-studded rally in Las Vegas.”

Reuters pulled a similar stunt. “Trump suggests Liz Cheney should face firing squad for her foreign policy stance,” reads its headline. The outlet cherry-picked the first section of Trump’s comment about Cheney “standing there with nine barrels shooting at her” and “guns trained on her face” — omitting the rest of his comments.

Tim Murtaugh, Trump’s communications chief, called the piece “100% fabricated crap” and “a lie.”

“Trump was obviously depicting Cheney as deployed to a war zone (with her own rifle, even. How’s that a ‘firing squad’?) just as she’s done to others,” Murtaugh posted to X.

This Reuters piece is 100% fabricated crap. A lie.



Trump was obviously depicting Cheney as deployed to a war zone (with her own rifle, even. How’s that a “firing squad”?) just as she’s done to others.



No byline on the Reuters piece? So brave.



Also, here’s the real quote: pic.twitter.com/TQqWIMHH3Q — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) November 1, 2024

A simple Google search reveals many similarly dishonest takes from left-wing media, from The New York Times to Newsweek. A headline from The Daily Beast even claims “Trump Fantasizes About Shooting Female Rival in the Face.”

Cheney quickly jumped on Trump’s remarks, painting herself as a victim.

“This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death,” Cheney posted on X. “We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala.”

Never mind this supposed “dictator” wants to end forever wars on the other side of the world and dismantle the military-industrial complex, while Cheney would happily send Americans to die in conflicts across the globe.

The Federalist’s Mark Hemingway pointed out left-wing media are knowingly spreading this dishonest take to bash Trump.

"Trump gonna call for Liz Cheney to face a firing squad"



This is a nonsensical interpretation of what he said, he made a clear rhetorical point about politicians voting for war w/o bearing the burden of fighting them.



Can't imagine why people openly say they hate the press! https://t.co/wKwRSh7HlM — Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) November 1, 2024

He also noted the left has shifted from attacking Republicans as supposed neocons and warhawks, to defending neocons and warhawks from Republican criticism.

“I lived through the Iraq war and I’m sorry but now DEMOCRATS are outraged by the suggestion rich politicians vote for wars without bearing the burden of fighting in them?” Hemingway wrote on X. “That’s all they said about Republicans for almost a decade.”

First, it was Epstein World for Harris. Now, it’s Diddy World’s turn to shill for Ka-ma-la.

The Daily Caller’s patriot-in-residence Mary Rooke recently broke down how high-profile elites with ties to convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein have been throwing money at pro-Harris organizations. Now, celebrities with ties (in some cases, very close ties) to alleged rapist Diddy are out on the campaign trail throwing their support behind the vice president.

Musician Usher stumped for Harris at an event in Atlanta earlier in October. When Usher was just 13 years old, Diddy was his legal guardian. Usher also said in a Rolling Stone interview in 2004 that the disgraced rapper introduced him to “a totally different set of shit — sex, specifically.” (RELATED: Famous Pop Star With Close Ties To Diddy Creates Cringe Video With VP After Saying He’s Stay Out Of Politics)

“Sex is so hot in the industry, man,” Usher said at the time, recalling that in Diddy’s house, “There was always girls around. You’d open a door and see somebody doing it, or several people in a room having an orgy. You never knew what was going to happen.”

In a 2013 interview with the Daily Mail, Usher said that Diddy was his “mentor” but that he would never pass on the advice the rapper gave him.

“I was introduced to everything by Puff Daddy when I was only 15 — parties, women, sex and drugs. I’ve had a taste of it but I’d never let it take me over,” the singer told the outlet.

Megastar Beyoncé, who endorsed Harris at a rally Oct. 25 in Houston, Texas, had been photographed partying with Diddy on numerous occasions. She had also attended Diddy’s notorious ‘White Parties’ and reportedly released new music at the events.

On Halloween, another big celebrity with ties to Diddy, Jennifer Lopez, delivered a speech at a Harris rally in Las Vegas. Lopez famously dated Diddy from 1999 to 2001. Like Beyoncé, Lopez had attended Diddy’s ‘White Parties.’ She had also dated the now-disgraced rapper when he was acquitted of bribery and illegal weapons charges stemming from an incident at a nightclub where she was present.

Although these Harris bedfellows are not on the same level as the Epstein-adjacent billionaires like Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman, celebrities with ties to the most notorious man in the entertainment industry might not be a great look for the vice president. Surely, the likes of Usher, Beyoncé and J-Lo won’t win over swing voters in battleground states such as Michigan or Pennsylvania. Maybe in Georgia. But at the very least, when your fellow travelers and political surrogates have ties to men like Epstein and Diddy, you are not going to foster trust between you and potential voters.
The vice president’s 2024 campaign has spent the final days of its run for the White House painting Trump with various names, including “fascist” and “petty tyrant.”

The Harris campaign began in a honeymoon phase, with its main messaging surrounding “joy.” But as the polls have continuously shown the race neck-and-neck, the vice president and her team have resorted to painting Trump as a dangerous threat to the country who would use unchecked power if elected again. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Harris Once Said Trump Represents ‘Contagion’ Afflicting America)

The switch began when Harris gave unexpected remarks from her residence on comments made by former Trump chief of staff John Kelly to both The New York Times and The Atlantic about how Trump would rule. In the articles, both contested by the Trump campaign and various other sources, Kelly claims that Trump said Hitler “did some good things,” wanted generals like the Nazi dictator had and would rule like a fascist.

“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” Harris said, adding that it showed who Trump “really is.”

Later that day, the vice president told CNN that she believes Trump is a fascist, something the White House had previously confirmed that President Joe Biden believed.

The only attack Harris has tried to distance herself from is that of calling Trump supporters “garbage.”

Biden, while responding to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a Sunday rally, called Trump supporters “garbage” during a Zoom call Tuesday. The White House tried to explain the remarks by saying the president did not mean “supporters” but rather “supporter’s.” They put out a transcript reflecting such amid the firestorm.

BIDEN: “The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump’s] supporters.” pic.twitter.com/96myaudWvm — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 30, 2024

Since, The Associated Press revealed that the White House press office altered the transcript, overruling concerns from its official transcribers about doing so.

“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president said.

Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, compared Trump’s closing argument at a rally he held at Madison Square Garden to a pro-Nazi event that occurred in 1939.

“Donald Trump’s got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,” Walz said at a Nevada rally. “There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden.”

“And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there,” he continued.

Kamala Harris at the Ellipse: “On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into [the Oval Office] with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities of what I will get done for the American people.” Live updates: https://t.co/uQIjPySiDj pic.twitter.com/JgJ18PFGeO — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 29, 2024

The vice president ramped up the attacks on Trump at her closing argument at the Ellipse. Harris used the location of her speech, the last place where Trump spoke to his supporters before the Capitol Riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to emphasize the danger she claims the former president poses to the country

“Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” Harris said.

“Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute. He says one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th,” the continued.

The vice president continued, calling Trump a “petty tyrant,” who is “obsessed with revenge” and “consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power.” She called him “unstable,” and has previously called him “unhinged.” Harris even told her supporters that Trump will use the military against them.

“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls — quote — ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for President who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said.

“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” Harris continued.
If there’s one image that captures the craziness of this campaign, it’s got to be Donald Trump driving around in a garbage truck.

He put on the orange vest and talked to reporters after a Joe Biden blunder put Kamala Harris on the defensive.

And this was after a Trump rally filled with profane insults, including a comic who mocked Puerto Rico as an island of floating garbage.

And that, in turn, followed the spectacle of the former president cooking up some fries at McDonald’s, where he actually likes to eat.

THE FATAL FLAW IN KAMALA HARRIS’ SPEECH, MARRED BY BIDEN’S ‘GARBAGE’ COMMENT

But all this is unfolding against the backdrop of the ugliest and perhaps most divisive race in American history, with each side accusing the other of being a danger to democracy.

And the tightness of the polls–assuming they’re not off again–has created an almost apocalyptic sense of drama, with many voters worried about post-election violence if Trump loses.

Trump, after all, has survived two impeachments, the Jan. 6 riot, four criminal indictments, one conviction and two assassination attempts. He has spent the last four years insisting, despite numerous failed lawsuits, that the last election was stolen from him.

Can there be more than 500 voters in the six or seven swing states who don’t have a rock-solid opinion of him, positive or negative?

As for Harris, she was a relatively unpopular vice president thrust into a 100-day sprint when Democrats pressured Biden into stepping aside. She soared through the convention but hid from the media – that’s now changed – yet kept sticking to talking points and didn’t make much news.

What’s more, Harris would be the first female president–and, of course, woman of color–to win the presidency in a country where some men, especially Black men, are reluctant to take that step.

BACKLASH BUILDS AGAINST BEZOS AS NON-ENDORSEMENT SPARKS HUGE SURGE IN CANCELLATIONS

I have never witnessed such a chasm in coverage as in 2024, not even when Barack Obama first ran for the White House. The Kamala coverage ranges from glowing to gushing, with minimal scrutiny even when she makes false claims. The Donald coverage is overwhelmingly negative, right down to the Hitler comparisons–which the press has pushed for years, even before John Kelly went on the record with his accusations.

It’s not hard to sense the frustration in the press that the improving economy isn’t helping Harris, especially with the news that inflation has dropped to 2.1 percent.

The New York Times says voters feel "relatively glum" about the economy, with the "lingering pessimism…The job market has been chugging along, although more slowly, overall growth has been healthy and even inflation is more or less back to normal."

A Wall Street Journal columnist said yesterday the next president will inherit a "remarkable economy," but that 62 percent of those in its poll rated it "not so good" or "poor."

There is generally a lag in public perception, as when George H.W. Bush found when he talked up economic improvements in 1992 but lost to Bill Clinton.

In this supercharged environment, every mistake counts.

JAKE PAUL ENDORSES TRUMP IN FIERY VIDEO TORCHING BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION: ‘CAN’T SIT BACK AND WATCH THIS’

Trump, speaking about criminals who cross the border illegally, said "I told women I will be their protector. They [his advisers] said, ‘Sir, please don’t say that.’ Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not."

That has an unfortunate ring to it, and Harris said yesterday it is "very offensive to women," including on controlling "their own bodies."

All of which brings us back to the last few days. When every hour counts, every distraction is costly. If you’re explaining, you’re losing. If you’re playing defense, you can’t put points on the board.

Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally was marred by racist and misogynist talk, the coverage of which totally overshadowed his speech. What drew the most attention was comedian Tony Hinchcliffe and his ridicule of Puerto Rico. Podcaster Joe Rogan said he heard the joke the day before and told the comic there would be a big backlash. But the Trump camp hadn’t vetted the speakers.

When Harris naturally denounced the "garbage" language, Trump hopped on the sanitation truck emblazoned with his name.

Biden has been hurting his VP’s candidacy with a series of screwups. First he said of Trump, "Lock him up." Then the president blurted out that "the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters." He stumbled before adding that this was about the "demonization of Latinos."

Castigating the other side’s voters is about the worst thing you can do, as Hillary Clinton learned eight years ago. That choked off the favorable coverage of her speech on the Ellipse–itself designed to mirror Trump’s Jan. 6 speech–and was the focus of reporters’ questions the next morning.

Harris distanced herself, saying Biden had clarified his remarks and she would never criticize voters who don’t support her. An NBC reporter asked her about it again yesterday.

Trump’s brief stint at McDonald’s was meant to highlight his contention that Harris never worked at one during college, as she has insisted. It was a brilliant tactic and one her side should have conjured up first.

National Review writer Noah Rothman says the candidates are just "trolling" each other, presenting voters with "a choice between two gratingly flip campaigns that are consumed with frivolities."

I would differ on the main point. The whole point of a campaign is for voters to size up how the candidates perform under pressure, since no one knows what crises may arise. How they react to attacks, stunts and interviews gives us a sense of their rapid-response abilities that go beyond policy positions–especially in such a razor-thin election.
The Trump campaign filed a complaint against The Washington Post with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in response to advertising efforts Republicans argue amount to illegal electioneering.

On Thursday, the Dhillon Law Group filed a complaint on behalf of former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, that claims the Post is engaged in “a dark money corporate campaign” to boost Vice President Kamala Harris.

“The Washington Post recently announced it would not endorse a presidential candidate, a decision the Post’s owner defended on the basis that ‘Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,’” the complaint reads. “Yet, on October 30, 2024, the news website Semafor published a report titled ‘Washington Post pays to boost stories critical of Trump as subscribers flee.’”

The Semafor article published Wednesday chronicled the paper’s desperate efforts to save readership after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers in the aftermath of an announcement that the editorial board would not endorse Harris.

“Washington Post pays to boost stories critical of Trump as subscribers flee,” the headline read.

Semafor reported that eight days before Election Day, “On Monday, the paper aggressively ramped up its paid advertising campaign, boosting dozens of articles related to the election. While the articles about Vice President Kamala Harris were relatively neutral in tone and focused on her innovative digital strategy, her policy proposals, and her chances of winning next week, the articles that the Post paid to highlight about Trump told a different story.”

The Post “boosted multiple critical articles, including about Trump’s campaign rhetoric, his misstatements, his allies’ attempts to ‘energize him as he struggles to adapt to Harris,’ how his campaign damaged Springfield, Ohio, his fixation on the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, how crowds leave his rallies early, and his questioning of the results of the 2020 election, among other stories.”

The advertising campaign, according to the Trump campaign complaint filed with the FEC, meets the legal qualifications of “in-kind corporate contributions” to Harris for president.

The latest push to maintain subscribers was also the subject of another FEC complaint, filed by the Chicago nonprofit Center for American Rights on Thursday.

“We’re days from an election, and the Washington Post is pouring cash into social media advertising that exclusively helps one candidate for president and denigrates another,” the group’s president said in a press release. “That sort of last-minute spending is not protected by the FEC’s press exemption; the Post needs to come clean and comply with the law.”

In his interview with Joe Rogan, released Thursday afternoon, Vance spoke about the turmoil overwhelming The Washington Post after the paper chose not to endorse a candidate for president this year.

“The Washington Post might as well be a propaganda outlet of the Democratic Party,” Vance said. “I don’t care, frankly, whether the editorial page endorses Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. I care about whether the journalists are lying about Donald Trump or lying about Kamala Harris.”

“And frankly,” Vance added, “they’re lying a lot in the negative direction about my running mate, and they’re lying a lot in the positive direction about Kamala Harris.”

JD Vance: “The Washington Post might as well be a propaganda outlet of the Democratic Party.

CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday night that he had “no idea” what would happen in the presidential election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump has an edge just five days out from Election Day as Republicans have seen a surge in early voting, holding leads in five of seven swing states in the RealClear Polling averages, with the vice president’s only leads being in Wisconsin and Michigan, and neither lead higher than 0.5%. Enten told “The Source” host Kaitlan Collins the race was a “dead heat.” (RELATED: ‘The Million Dollar Question’: CNN’s Harry Enten Says He Can’t Tell Who ‘Lower Turnout’ Helps In Election)

WATCH:



“I think what stood out to me is that the races haven’t moved at all, not one iota. You go back to August, the numbers in all three states look exactly the same as they do now,” Enten told Collins, a former Daily Caller reporter. “And you have to ask yourself, when these campaigns are spending all this gosh darn money on the air, especially in Pennsylvania, and it’s just a dead heat.”

Trump and Harris have poured over $500 million into advertising in Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

“So now as we stand less than a week from the election, I continuously say Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, and I also continuously say, I have no idea what the heck is going to happen,” Enten said. “And people call me a waffler for that, but I’m just being honest with folks. I have no idea. This is the tightest election I’ve ever seen.”

Harris trails Trump by 0.4% in the RealClear Polling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 29, with Trump’s lead dropping to 0.1% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

Trump leads Harris in a head-to-head matchup by 0.8% in polls of Pennsylvania voters from Oct. 7 to Oct. 29, according to the RealClear Polling average, and leads or is tied in five of the last six polls in the crucial swing state when independent candidate Cornel West, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are included as options in the surveys.

Trump has been capitalizing on President Joe Biden labeling the former president’s supporters as “garbage” during a virtual campaign event Tuesday. Trump took questions from reporters in a garbage truck, while Harris was forced into damage control mode as she attempted to distance herself from the president’s comments.

Jake Paul threw his support behind Donald Trump for the 2024 U.S. Presidential election in a passionate video posted Oct. 31.

Paul acknowledged that he couldn’t actually vote himself, after rescinding his right to do so when he moved to Puerto Rico. He noted that his inability to vote “doesn’t mean I can’t present my 80 million-large audience with proper facts, numbers and data to encourage them to vote in the proper direction to quite literally save America,” he said.

Paul went on to quote stats that read strongly in Trump’s favor, and he knocked Harris’ celebrity endorsements.

Paul began by noting he was prepared for the backlash after sharing his political views.

“Uh nervous, scared to make this video because of what it means in terms of my career, my life, people coming after me — more accusations, more turmoil, more

division, potentially,” he said. “However, I just want to provide information to the potentially undecided voter the things that I have seen over the past couple of

years that have led me in a certain direction as to who I am supporting in this presidential election.”

Paul brought up how the economy, the border crisis and gender ideology were all issues that have swayed him in favor of Trump.

He reiterated that he expected backlash for presenting his views in the video but declared he was not scared of the “liberal left media.” He then encouraged his fanbase to see through the celebrities that endorsed Harris. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

“Do your own research, and base that research in the truth, not just reckless propaganda, or your favorite pop star telling you to vote a certain way and you believing them because you love their song,” Paul said.

“Most of your favorite celebrities, athletes, all of them are secretly conservative because the left has created a world where conservatives like me speaking out have major, major consequences,” he said.

Paul clarified that the comments made by Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico were not uttered by Trump himself, and put the focus back on Trump’s accomplishments, compared to Harris’ failures. He pointed to the fact that inflation has been worse under the Biden Administration than during the Trump years.

Kamala has ” basically no accomplishments” while in office, Paul said,

He went on to detail his perception of Trump.

“Do I think Donald Trump is a perfect human being? No, I don’t think anybody on this planet is a perfect human being, myself included. Don’t judge people off of a character that the media has portrayed them to be,” he said.

“To be frank, I’m not concerned with Donald Trump’s character flaws or what he’s done in the past — what I’m concerned with is how good of a president he is, because that is his job and that is what’s going to affect the people of This Nation.”

Paul criticized the current dynamic of conservatives not being able to voice their opinions without major backlash from the left.

“That’s only going to get worse unless people like myself stand up and say fuck the system.”

“I can’t sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer,” Paul said. (RELATED: Usher Creates Cringe Video With Kamala Harris After Saying He’s Staying Out Of Politics)

“Even if you hate me for making this video, my message to you is, I love you even if you are lost. Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, I have love for all of the people of America.”

“Do the right thing and vote for Donald Trump.”
CNN’s Scott Jennings warned Republicans on Tuesday against banking on former President Donald Trump to overperform the polls in the upcoming election, as he has done in the past.

Polls between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump have tightened over the last few weeks, with data showing a tug-of-war battle between the two for the key swing states that could decide the outcome of the election. On “Anderson Cooper 360,” CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Jennings for his thoughts on the polls, to which the political commentator questioned how many undecided voters are truly polled.

“I think it’s close. I‘ve wondered if all media outlets had just not taken any polls for the last six months, what will we do with all the money? We’d have an amazing Christmas party, you know? I mean, it‘s a tied race — it’s tied nationally, it‘s tied in these swing states,” Jennings said.

“I think some of these people who are undecided tell pollsters that because they want to seem like they‘re discerning. But they have a gut feeling about how they feel about, certainly, Donald Trump. They may not have as much of a gut about Kamala Harris because she‘s come into the race lesser known. I agree with Ashley, I think some people are deciding whether to vote at all,” Jennings added.

Jennings went on to state how both Trump and Harris need voters to head to the polls with less than seven days to go, cautioning Republicans after highlighting their feelings of confidence. (RELATED: Watch What Harris Says About Handling Internal Polls As Election Nears)

“I think for Trump, it’s this low propensity play — low propensity men. People who have little engagement with the news, little engagement with our civic affairs in this country. Maybe they never vote, maybe they only voted once or twice in their lives,” Jennings said. “Getting them out is obviously vital. For Harris, she has her own cohort of voters that are in the same boat, like people who need to be given a vibe about this is going to manifestly impact my life if I don‘t get out and do this.”

WATCH:

“I think ultimately, at the end of the race, I agree with Gretchen. There is something about these events and the news cycles that give you a certain kind of energy or a vibe about a campaign. I’ll just say Republicans feel confident,” Jennings continued. “Some people are taking it as an article of faith that he will overperform because he did in the last two elections. I would just caution everyone to say, you don‘t know that. He might, but you don‘t really know that. You cannot take that to the bank. So if you’re expecting that on election night, just know it’s not something you can necessarily bank.”

Since Friday, political pundits have pointed out Republicans are performing better than they have in past elections in early voting in states like Nevada, Georgia and New Jersey. While concerns have risen among Democrats about Harris losing ground with key voting blocs, including Hispanic and black men, the vice president regained a slight lead in Michigan and Wisconsin following Trump’s previous advantage across the seven main swing states on Oct. 18, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages.

As a grassroots consultant who played a key role in campaigns across the years, including my firm’s work knocking on millions of doors and being an essential player in Dr. Ben Carson’s 2016 presidential campaign, I have seen my share of election cycles. We have canvassed pivotal Senate and House races in vital swing states, but I have never seen early voting numbers like we are seeing for Donald Trump right now.

Despite relentless media attacks and indictments, Trump is gaining unprecedented momentum, especially in swing states. He has never looked better, and it is not due to fleeting moments. A series of key events have fueled this surge, setting the stage for a strong performance at the polls.

Today, we are seeing the real Donald Trump — the one his supporters have always known.

The assassination attempt against Trump was a turning point. He did not retreat — he stood firm. This resonated with voters tired of weakness in Washington. Trump embodied the “fight, fight, fight” spirit that many Americans crave, especially in contrast to the Biden-Harris administration, which has often struggled to project competence. The debate that followed showcased this stark contrast. Trump remained calm and resolute, highlighting his presidency’s strength, while Biden’s leadership appeared to falter. For many Americans, this was a reminder that Trump is a fighter — a trait they respect in these uncertain times.

That show of strength wasn’t lost on swing-state voters. I’ve been on the ground across these states, and you can feel the shift. People are noticing, especially those who feel abandoned by the current administration. Early voting numbers reflect this renewed energy, and it’s clear that voters are rallying around a leader who will not back down.

Then there was Kamala Harris’ disastrous handling of Hurricane Helene. While she attended fundraisers and podcasts, Trump was doing what leaders do: He took action and showed empathy. He offered help to victims, donating rooms at his hotels for first responders, while Kamala appeared disconnected. It was not just a failure of optics; it was a failure of leadership. And voters noticed.

Trump’s presence and decisiveness struck a chord with voters who expect action in times of crisis. Meanwhile, Kamala’s absence left a void that Trump filled with ease. Soon after, Elon Musk’s America PAC and Team Trump RNC volunteers started breaking through in swing states. The groundwork had already been laid, but this moment gave it the spark needed to boost early voting in key areas.

Today, we are seeing the real Donald Trump — the one his supporters have always known. He is not just a fighter but someone who genuinely cares about the American people. Whether it is helping hurricane victims or standing up for families affected by illegal immigration, Trump has shown an empathy that Kamala Harris seems to lack. He is also showcasing a more relatable side, appearing in long-form podcasts and having fun with things like McDonald’s visits. It is humanizing and authentic, and voters are responding.

That same authenticity is breaking through, especially with black and Latino men in cities like Milwaukee and Philadelphia. These voters, who feel left behind by Kamala’s empty promises, remember being better off under Trump just four years ago. They are looking for solutions to realities such as inflation, rising business costs, and job security, but all Kamala offers them is talk about abortion. While that may resonate with some, it neglects to address the economic pain these communities are facing.

These voters are seeking leadership that understands their struggles, and Kamala Harris simply is not delivering. Conversely, Trump is showing up, offering action and solutions, and it’s clearly resonating in early voting numbers across the country.

This has led to what we are witnessing today: the collapse of Kamala Harris and of the tired narrative that Trump is some kind of villain. Voters are seeing through the media’s constant barrage. The more they see of the real Trump, the more they like him. Combine that with the impressive ground game that’s been built, and you have a formula for success. Early voting numbers are already reflecting this momentum, with GOP ballots overperforming and Democratic enthusiasm lagging.

It isn’t just about enthusiasm. Ground games matter, and the Trump campaign has built one that is laser-focused on key swing states. Personally, I have been in every major battleground this month, and you can feel the energy. People are talking about Trump in ways that they were not just a few months ago. Campaign efforts are building the foundation for a massive Election Day turnout. If early voting trends continue, a wave of Republican votes may overwhelm the Democrats.

As someone who has been in the trenches of political campaigns for years, I can tell you this: Donald Trump has never looked better. The movement on the ground is real, the early voting numbers are proving it, and if this momentum continues, we are looking at a GOP victory that will shock the establishment once again.
Former President Donald Trump is up in Pennsylvania by five percentage points, according to an Echelon Insights survey released just days ahead of the pivotal 2024 presidential election.

The survey asked respondents either who they already voted for or plan to vote for in the presidential election. Most, 51 percent, said Trump, followed by 46 percent who said Vice President Kamala Harris — a five-point gap.

Another one percent said Green Party candidate Jill Stein, one percent said someone else, and one percent reman unsure.

The survey also phrased the question this way: “If the 2024 presidential election were being held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris?”

In that scenario, 52 percent of Pennsylvania voters said they either definitely will support Trump, probably would support Trump, or lean Trump. Just 46 percent said the same of Harris — a six point gap in this case.

For greater perspective, the survey asked if they approve or disapprove of the way President Joe Biden, who has Harris as his vice president, is handling the country. Most, 58 percent, said they either strongly or somewhat disapprove, compared to 40 percent who strongly or somewhat approve. On the flip side, 50 percent said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the way Trump handled his job as president, compared to 49 percent who do not.

The survey also found that the vast majority, 92 percent, identify themselves as extremely or very motivated to vote, and most, 59 percent, plan to vote in person on Election Day.

The survey was taken October 27-30,2024, among 600 registered voters. It has a +/- 4.5 percent margin of error.

Thursday’s RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Trump up by an average of 0.7 percent in the Keystone State.

C-SPAN
During a Formula 1 race, a Pennsylvania news station showed election “test results” of Vice President Kamala Harris winning the state.

WNEP, a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre-based television news station, explained in a statement that “test results” showing Kamala Harris receiving 52 percent and former President Donald Trump receiving 47 percent had “mistakenly appeared on WNEP-TV” early Sunday night.

The news station explained that the numbers had been “randomly generated” and had been “sent out to help news organizations make sure their equipment is working properly.”

“Test results for the upcoming November 5 general election mistakenly appeared on WNEP-TV early Sunday evening during a broadcast of the Formula 1 Mexico Grand Prix,” the news station said. “Those numbers should not have appeared on the screen, and it was an error by WNEP that they did.”

Many people took to social media to criticize the news station, while others pointed out that it was “obviously test data,” noting that Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick’s “check mark” was not “even right.”

“Sigh,” Mark Mitchell, the head pollster with Rasmussen Reports wrote in a post on X. “This is obviously test data plugged in by an idiot. The McCormick check mark isn’t even right. A Harris 5% PA win would be Venezuela-like.”

“Is the US election already decided?” one person wrote in a post. “At what point does ignoring the people produce civil war?”

“How can this be? PA already called for Harris?” another person asked.

The test results of the election from WNEP come as a Monmouth survey, conducted between October 24-28, 2024, of 824 registered Pennsylvania voters found that 47 percent said they would either “definitely” or “probably” vote for Trump, while 46 percent said they would vote for Harris. As Breitbart News’s Nick Gilbertson has previously reported, the “easiest path to victory” for Trump in the presidential election includes the swing states of Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, which would “put Trump precisely at 270 votes”: Trump’s easiest path to victory includes three swing states, all on the East Coast: Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. These three states would put Trump precisely at 270 votes, securing him a second term. This appears to be Trump’s easiest path, considering it is just three states, two of which–North Carolina and Georgia–historically tilt in the GOP’s favor. North Carolina, the only swing state to go for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, has voted Republican in five of the last six presidential elections. The same applies to Georgia, which was a historically red state before it went blue for the first time this millennium in 2020.

The Republican Party in Pennsylvania has made great strides in increasing the number of voters who have registered with the party over the Democratic Party.

Voter registration data also showed that five Pennsylvania counties that had previously leaned Democratic, had shifted to having a Republican majority. The five counties included: Beaver County, Berks County, Bucks County, Fayette County, and Luzerne County.
Critics are wondering whether the Biden-Harris Department of Justice will hold Jimmy Kimmel to the same standard to which it held pro-Trump social media influencer Douglass Mackey, who was convicted for supposed "election interference" and sentenced to prison last year for memes.

There is cause to be skeptical. After all, the DOJ has a habit of holding conservatives to a higher standard than its ideological allies.

Former Trump advisers Stephen Bannon and Peter Navarro were convicted for supposed contempt of Congress, whereas Attorney General Merrick Garland and former Attorney General Eric Holder got off scot-free. The proudly pro-abortion DOJ has almost exclusively targeted pro-life activists when it comes to FACE Act charges. The same DOJ adopted a draconian and in some cases "fact-free approach" when prosecuting Jan. 6 protesters after previously treating Black Lives Matter rioters with kid gloves.

The titular host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has recently made a number of desperate appeals to potential voters, asking them to get out and vote — just not for President Donald Trump.

In his monologue Wednesday, the Harris booster said, "You have to vote. If you can vote early, vote early. If you can't vote early, vote on time. If you want to vote for Trump, vote late. Vote very late. Do your voting on Thursday or maybe Friday."

'Biden's DOJ sent Douglass Mackey to prison for sharing this same joke.'

Libs of TikTok responded, "Wasn't Douglass Mackey sentenced to prison for doing something similar? Will @TheJusticeDept investigate Jimmy Kimmel?"

Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) noted, "Douglass Mackey was sent to prison for this."

"Biden's DOJ sent Douglass Mackey to prison for sharing this same joke about Hillary," tweeted former Salomon Brothers and Citigroup investment banker John LeFevre. "Another example of the weaponized lawfare and two-tiered justice that awaits us if Kamala wins."

Mackey chimed in, tweeting, "Jimmy Kimmel told his joke to an audience of millions. The joke meme I sent out didn't even reach more than 100 people until Buzzfeed and Wired reported on it."

Mackey was arrested in 2021, convicted in New York for supposed "election interference," and sentenced in October 2023 to seven months in prison by an Obama-appointed judge, Ann M. Donnelly.

At the time, Trump said, "They're putting Douglass Mackey in jail for sharing a joking meme about Hillary Clinton seven years ago. Nobody ever heard of anything like that."

According to the Biden-Harris DOJ, "Between September 2016 and November 2016, Mackey conspired with other influential Twitter users and with members of private online groups to use social media platforms, including Twitter, to disseminate fraudulent messages that encouraged supporters of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to 'vote' via text message or social media which was legally invalid."

The Intercept noted that there is no federal law against lying about election mechanisms or the electoral process. Mackey was instead indicted under a Reconstruction-era statue known as Section 241 or the "Ku Klux Klan Act," which prohibits conspiring to "injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person" trying to exercise a constitutionally or federally protected right.

The DOJ was evidently proud of the mental gymnastics required to charge the Clinton critic, stating that his prosecution was "groundbreaking."

Mackey is appealing his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court, should that fail.

According to Mackey and amici curiae, "The First Amendment tolerates narrow, clear statutes that target knowingly false speech concerning the time, place, and manner, or other technical mechanics of an election. But Section 241 is not such a statute. This Court should reverse the decision of the district court."

"When I made an election joke, the Deep State used it as a pretext to conduct a fishing expedition against me, subpoenaing all financial records, leases, employment information and pay stubs, and email accounts. Will Jimmy Kimmel enjoy the same?" Mackey tweeted on Thursday.

'Force these scumbags to live by their own rules.'

One X user noted that Kimmel's "violation is worse than what [Mackey was] convicted for, and he transmitted this over federally licensed airwaves. The @FCC, @FBI, #FEC and #DOJ should be contacted, @ABC should be immediately sanctioned, and @Jimmykimmel needs to be investigated. Anything less is selective and preferential justice."

Rob Eno, Blaze Media's director of content marketing, quipped, "It would be a real shame if everyone flooded the US DOJ crime tip line and ask them to charge Jimmy Kimmel with the same crime they charged Douglass Mackey with. A real shame. I'm not telling you to to go this link and do it."

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh tweeted, "I'm dead serious when I say if Trump wins he should have Jimmy Kimmel arrested and jailed. Force these scumbags to live by their own rules."

Libertarian strategist Tim Miller said Thursday on a podcast that Democrats should stop coddling President Joe Biden to make him feel “included” in the presidential election, despite his departure from the race in July.

Republicans called out Biden Tuesday after he referred to former President Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage” during an interview with Voto Latino. On “Pod Save America,” Miller called Biden’s remarks “indecipherable,” suggesting that Biden likely didn’t mean to target Trump supporters and should focus on other obligations rather than trying to assist Vice President Kamala Harris.

“I don’t think that his intention was actually to call Donald Trump supporters garbage, but who could tell? Like, really, the whole quote is indecipherable. What he talked about before that was not decipherable, and it’s just — it’s not helpful to be out there,” Miller said. “It gets me a little angry because it’s like I don’t know why people in the Democratic party and around the Biden administration, even on the Harris campaign, like why we feel like we have to baby the president of the United States and like walk on eggshells and make sure he feels included.”

“He’s the president of the United States. President Biden should do president things — he should have private meetings, he should meet with the generals, he should meet with the pardon committee, think about who he’s going to pardon and what other obligations he has for the last two months. Like that is his job for right now,” Miller added.

Miller continued to state how Biden interviewing with others isn’t helpful for Harris, pleading for Biden to not take it as an insult in his suggestion to no longer have him campaign. (RELATED: ‘Don’t Believe This Crap’: Megyn Kelly Says Voters Aren’t Buying Dems’ ‘Hitler’ Rhetoric)

WATCH:

“It is not helpful for him to be out at all with Kamala Harris — he shouldn’t take that personally, we shouldn’t have to care about what his feelings are about it,” Miller continued. “He shouldn’t make people feel bad that he’s not being — whatever. Like, you know, you see these leaks in The New York Times and Politico about this issue, and I find it very frustrating. Everybody should be singly focused on the goal of defeating Donald Trump, having Kamala Harris win this election.”

“It’s hard to think about anything public that Joe Biden could do that would be beneficial to that goal and certainly not being on some Zoom to fill the calendar,” Miller said. “I can’t possibly think about why that would have been useful. So please, I’m begging everybody, it’s not personal — nobody take it personally. If I made a big gaffe on this podcast and tomorrow Fox News is airing it and it would be better for me to go hide for the last five days, I would go hide. Like whatever it takes, Kamala Harris needs to win.”

The controversial comment from Biden came after Republicans and Trump received backlash after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” during the Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.

Harris has reportedly tried to distance herself from Biden since becoming the party’s presidential nominee, as voters’ top concerns include the economy, inflation and immigration — areas where Biden has polled poorly against Trump. Despite these efforts, Harris notably stated during an Oct. 8 interview on ABC’s “The View” that not one “thing” came to mind when asked if she would change anything from the last four years.

San Francisco 49ers offensive lineman Jon Feliciano said those claiming to be offended by a joke about Puerto Rico at a Donald Trump rally are pushing an agenda.

During Trump's star-studded rally at Madison Square Garden, roast comedian Tony Hinchcliffe caused a liberal meltdown when he joked that there was an island of garbage floating in the ocean and he thinks "it's called Puerto Rico."

Hinchcliffe's comments angered media members and political commentators, but he has since refused to apologize saying, "These people have no sense of humor."

Feliciano, who is half Puerto Rican, remarked on Monday that he felt the outrage was largely feigned because it helps certain people politically.

"The only Puerto Ricans that are mad about Tony Hinchcliffe's joke, are mad because it helps push their agenda," Feliciano wrote on X. "Tony's joke was so soft compared to his usual material."

The Miami native was responding to a fan who said Feliciano seemed to be "down with [Joey] Bosa wearing a maga hat," while linking to Hinchcliffe's joke, seemingly in attempt to display the joke as dangerous or harmful.

Feliciano had recently shared a video that showed teammate Joey Bosa crash a postgame interview wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat.

When asked later by reporters, Bosa said he felt it was "an important time" to show his political leanings.

Feliciano routinely shares pro-Trump videos on his social media page and clearly isn't shy about his political endorsement.

'I find that guy very funny. I’m sorry, I don’t know what to tell you.'

As for the backlash against Hinchcliffe, comedians have come out in his defense, including media darling and left-wing Comedy Central host Jon Stewart.

"Obviously, in retrospect, having a roast comedian come to a political rally a week before Election Day and roasting a key demographic ... probably not the best decision by the campaign politically, but to be fair, the guy's just really doing what he does," Stewart explained.

"I find that guy very funny. I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you," he told his audience.

Additionally, the Puerto Rican mayor of Keller, Texas, came out in defense of Trump.

"For Latinos, faith, family, and economic opportunity motivates us - not some bad joke by a comedian," Armin Mizani said.

Cuban American Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) echoed a similar sentiment, saying, "What isn't a joke and truly outrageous is how 'journalists' are helping Kamala [Harris] with her dangerous campaign of hate."

Rubio pointed out that media members have been "calling Trump the new Hitler" while MSNBC "used old footage of Nazi rallies" to smear Trump supporters.

Incredibly, Kamala Harris’ pantsuit did not burst into flames Wednesday in a 22-minute rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, despite her tired old speech filled with lies.

No doubt some of her supporters spent more time finding decent parking than listening to their candidate speak.

Harris became flustered, then disturbingly stern, during her short remarks when she was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. She responded by shouting angrily.

“We are six days away from an election, and ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard,” Harris shouted as security escorted the protesters out. “That is what is on the line in this election. Look, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.”

You can probably count on one hand the number of politicians who have found success while shouting angrily at the crowd gathered to see them speak. There have been a few who have employed that technique, but it is terribly uncommon.

A lot of politicians find they connect more with their audience through humor and authentic speeches.

During her speech, Harris averaged a lie every 3 minutes. The media did not call her out on any of them. Here are a few fibs she needs her followers to believe.

Lie 1: Trump is unstable.

Trump can make it through an ad-libbed speech lasting over an hour, as he shows at every campaign rally. He recently had a fully lucid, no-holds barred, three-hour conversation on the Joe Rogan podcast. He spontaneously takes questions from just about anyone and can think on his feet. Harris has handlers, teleprompters, and needs pre-determined questions to go before an audience. She still says President Joe Biden is stable and thinking clearly. Maybe she is not the best judge of stability.

Just so everyone understands what happened here:



At a Kamala Harris event, billed as a “town hall,” a guest asked if they could ask questions.



Maria Shriver said no, the questions were “pre-determined.”



No doubt Harris already knew them too.



Watch:pic.twitter.com/h41bNUFkjf — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 22, 2024

Lie 2: Trump is obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.

Harris used the same line, verbatim, Tuesday in a Washington, D.C. speech and again in Harrisburg. But nothing in Trump’s previous presidential term suggests his goal is unchecked power. He doesn’t talk about revenge on the campaign trail. And after the Department of Justice, led by Biden, attacked Trump with bogus lawfare and threatened to jail him, Trump has said he would consider giving the president’s son Hunter Biden a pardon.

Lie 3: She will listen to the people who disagree with her and give them a seat at the table

Well, not pro-Palestinian hecklers at her rally. They will be thrown out. But also, not pro-life activists. The Biden Harris administration has imprisoned numerous pro-life sidewalk counselors who urge women walking into abortion businesses not to kill their baby. That used to be called freedom of speech. But Harris has had a hand in putting peaceful grandmothers and grandfathers in federal prison for years, where they will remain if she is elected. Trump has said he would pardon prisoners of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.

Lie 4: Trump would ban abortion nationwide.

Trump has never said this. When asked about abortion, Trump has said that his role was through appointments he made on the Supreme Court. When the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion became a state issue, and Trump has leaned on that as his answer. The issue is in the states’ hands now, and local voters have more control over it through their voting choices for state legislators. Trump has said he believes most people want to see some exceptions carved out.

Lie 5: Trump would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatment at risk, and force states to monitor women’s pregnancies.

Where does Harris come up with this stuff? Monitor pregnancies? No. Trump has never spoken about wanting that or restricting access to birth control. These are weird things to say. Birth control is readily available at any doctor’s office and most drug stores. These issues have not been in the national conversation, other than through this bogus scare tactic Harris spouts in her speeches and advertising. It is meant for voters who are not paying close attention to politics.

Trump has spoken in full throated support of IVF, to the disappointment of some pro-lifers. IVF involves creating multiple embryos but not using them all.

President Trump just released his statement on abortion and it’s moderate.



He says he supports the creation of life, including IVF and that the choice on abortion should be left up to the states.



Trump is against Biden’s position of abortion till birth.pic.twitter.com/cceSXyy21A — Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) April 8, 2024

Lie 6: Trump wants to implement Project 2025

Just because Harris plagiarizes material during her workday, it doesn’t mean Trump does.

The Heritage Foundation authored Project 2025 in 2023. It is not Trump’s work. He is not copying it. Trump has planned his own agenda for the country.

EXCLUSIVE: In 2007, Kamala Harris plagiarized pages of Congressional testimony from a Republican colleague.



And in 2012, she plagiarized a fictionalized story about sex trafficking—but presented it as a real case.

Here we go again. It's election season, and it's time to roll out the fear-mongering tactics to get people to vote left. Trump, on the record, disavowed Project 2025. Believe that nonsense if you want, Trump 2024! pic.twitter.com/7uUzvowlTH — MugenLord (@MugenLord) July 21, 2024

Lie 7: Trump will try to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions of Americans off of their health care.

Nope. It is the opposite. Trump has said he would keep the Affordable Care Act unless lawmakers can come up with something better for Americans. Trump has said he is behind the $35 insulin cap that Biden and now Harris take credit for. The truth is the cost measure started under Trump and improved under Biden.

It is exhausting to stay on top of the many lies Harris speaks. Instead of offering creative solutions to real problems America faces, she is obsessed with talking about Trump.

If she cannot come up with original material, offer meaningful, in-depth policy ideas, or speak with candor, the only thing to learn from a Harris speech is that, even as the media fails to report it, lies are her constant calling card.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, major tech leaders are making efforts to connect with former President Donald Trump, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who Trump called a “great guy, very smart.”

The Hill reports that in a major shift from their often contentious relationship during his first term, the CEOs of some of the world’s most prominent technology companies are now reaching out to former President Donald Trump as the 2024 election draws near. Tech giants are seemingly looking to mend fences and potentially secure a more favorable position should he return to the White House.

Recent weeks have seen a flurry of communication between the former president and tech leaders, including Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Amazon’s Andy Jassy. Trump revealed that Pichai called him after his widely publicized shift at a McDonald’s drive-thru, praising the event as one of the biggest in Google’s history. Trump told a rally audience, “I actually got a call from Sundar. Sundar, who’s great, from Google, he’s a great guy, very smart. The head of Google.”

Just a month ago, Trump threatened to prosecute at the “maximum levels” for election interference:

In a post on Truth Social, the former president claimed that Google “has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump” while simultaneously “only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris.” The post continues, “This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections. If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the Election, and become President of the United States!”

Similarly, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly reached out to Trump to discuss concerns over a European Union court ruling that ordered Apple to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes.

While some tech leaders are making cautious overtures, others, like Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, have fully embraced Trump’s candidacy. Musk has not only endorsed the former president but has also contributed $118 million to a super PAC supporting his campaign and has taken an active role in boosting Trump’s profile by hosting town halls and joining him at rallies.

Analysts suggest that this outreach from the tech world is a form of hedging bets and “anticipatory compliance.” Owen Tedford, a senior research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, notes that establishing a positive relationship with Trump early on could pay dividends throughout his potential second term. Additionally, tech firms may be hoping for reduced antitrust pressure under a Trump administration, given the current Biden administration’s aggressive stance against Big Tech.

However, Trump’s history of being tough on business leaders who he believes have wronged him adds an element of uncertainty to these developing relationships. During his first term, the former president had a notably contentious relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, largely due to Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post. Trump has also been critical of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, particularly after Facebook banned him from the platform.

Top House Republicans are coalescing behind the House Administration Committee’s subpoena of Democratic fundraising giant ActBlue.

Republicans have accused the company of having insufficient donor verification standards. Committee Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis., has argued that the site is vulnerable to fraudulent and illegal foreign donations, though ActBlue has said it "rigorously protects donors’ security."

"ActBlue has a lot of explaining to do, and Chairman Steil is right to demand answers on these very serious allegations of foreign funds being funneled through the platform," Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairman of House Republicans’ campaign arm, told Fox News Digital.

"Just as we must protect the right to vote for American citizens, we must ensure our elections are free from foreign financial interference."

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., also credited Steil and pointed out that his accusations come amid reports that China and Iran are trying to influence the election.

"Malign foreign actors are attempting to hijack American elections through the Far Left Democrat fundraising platform ActBlue by tipping the scales in favor of Kamala Harris and Congressional Democrats," Stefanik said. "It has never been more critical to ensure American elections are free from foreign manipulation."

ActBlue did not require a card verification value (CVV) to be input for donations until recently, prompting a flurry of concern from Republican lawmakers and some GOP state attorneys general.

Steil sent multiple letters and requests for information to the platform, which has insisted it holds donor security to a high standard.

A spokesperson for House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said he was "supportive" of the subpoena, adding, "Only American citizens should be participants in our elections, and this investigation is critical to ensure that our elections remain secure and shielded from foreign actors."

Steil issued a subpoena Wednesday to ActBlue for "documents and communications related to ActBlue’s donor verification policies and the potential for foreign actors, primarily from Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and China to use ActBlue to launder illicit money into U.S. political campaigns."

ActBlue responded to Steil in a statement, "ActBlue has received Chairman Steil’s latest inquiry and will respond to address the continued inaccuracies and misrepresentations about our platform, as we have done previously. We rigorously protect donors' security and maintain strict anti-fraud compliance practices. We have zero tolerance for fraud on our platform."

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS ‘LACK OF LEADERSHIP’ IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

But fellow Republicans on his committee are standing firm that the subpoena was necessary.

Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., the chair of the panel's subcommittee on elections, told Fox News Digital, "In our investigation so far, we have found that loopholes in ActBlue’s insufficient security protocols may be exploited by bad actors, potentially leading to countries like China, Russia and Venezuela donating to campaigns in the names of Americans without their consent."

"With the general election just five days away, Americans need to have confidence that our elections are secure and that there is no foul play involved," she said.

Committee member Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., said, "The subpoena is critical for the committee to ensure federal campaign finance laws are not being violated, including laundering money into campaign coffers through inadequate security protections."

Meanwhile, Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital, "Like the chairman, I have been concerned by the inadequate security protocols at ActBlue, who haven’t required CVV verification and allow for pre-paid cards for political donations."

The accusations come at a critical time, with Election Day less than a week out.

The platform denied all GOP allegations of wrongdoing in a statement to Fox News before Steil’s subpoena, "These false claims about ActBlue have been discredited repeatedly by campaign finance experts. ActBlue protects donors’ information by maintaining a robust security program and fraud prevention measures, often beyond what is required by law."
Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) sat down with Turning Point Action for a Gen-Z town hall in High Point, North Carolina, on Thursday, where he warned students that they “have more to lose than anybody” if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election, because “the consequences are going to fall hardest on the people in this room.”

Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, touched upon the issues of foreign policy, illegal immigration, and unaffordable housing, and explained the ways in which they affect young people.

“Younger voters have the most to lose or the most to gain from getting this election either right or wrong,” Vance told students, adding that Harris “doesn’t have strong or sincere views about what she actually wants to do.”

Watch Below:

Vance went on to explain that while he has “a lot” of policy disagreements with “a person like Barack Obama,” the one thing former Obama had that Harris doesn’t is “he actually has beliefs and thoughts in his head for how he wants to govern the United States of America.”

“I don’t think you can say this about Kamala Harris,” Vance said, adding that when someone doesn’t have clear beliefs or thoughts about how they want to govern, they become “an empty vessel for whatever the prevailing ideas that are governing in Washington, DC, are.”

And those prevailing ideas running through Washington, DC, include the notion “that we should use our young people as cannon fodder for foreign military misadventures,” he said.

“I think you guys have a lot to lose, because we are on the precipice of many broad regional wars, potentially even a world war,” Vance continued. “Do you want a person like Kamala Harris negotiating in private rooms with people like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping? Or do you want a guy like Donald Trump actually sticking up for the United States of America?”

“I think the answer to that question is obvious,” Vance asserted.

Trump’s running mate added that another “prevailing idea in Washington, DC, is that we should let in millions upon millions of illegal immigrants, who compete against young Americans for important jobs, who undercut the wages of American workers.”

“Why are homes unaffordable in the United States of America right now? Why have housing prices gone up by 45 percent in the state of North Carolina?” Vance asked. “The answer is that — one, we’re not building enough homes.”

“If you look at Donald Trump’s regulatory policies vs. Kamala Harris’s regulatory policies — yes, if Donald Trump is president, we will build far more homes than we would if Kamala Harris is the president,” Vance elaborated.

Moreover, the illegal immigration issue and housing issue are connected, the senator explained.

“It’s important to recognize that no matter how many homes you build, if you allow an unlimited wave of illegal immigrants to come into the United States of America, those people are going to end up owning the houses or living in the houses that ought by right go to American citizens,” Vance said.

“When you let in way too many illegal immigrants, the price of housing shoots through the roof,” he added.

Vance then implored students to consider the following questions: “Do I want to have a job where I earn a good day’s wage for a good day’s work?” and “Do I want to raise a family in an environment — or just build a life in an environment — where I can afford to buy a home?”

“Because if so, you’ve got to vote for Donald Trump,” Vance declared.

“Kamala Harris’s policies are going to produce more war, more poverty, higher housing prices, and lower wages for American workers,” Vance warned.

“You guys have more to lose than anybody,” Trump’s running mate said. “If we let the American Dream disappear in the United States of America, the consequences are going to fall hardest on the people in this room.”

How did it come to this? Underwhelmed Democrats are reportedly asking each other this simple question six days out from the election as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to stumble eagerly from one disappointment to the next on the campaign trail.

Amie Parnes from The Hill reports fingers in Democratic circles are already being pointed behind the scenes in the event their candidate falls to surging former President Donald Trump.

The senior staff writer details while some Democrats hold out hope for Harris others have expressed mounting frustration about a string of factors that have plagued the campaign almost from the day she was anointed without a single party vote being cast.

C-SPAN

Messaging on the economy is just one of a number of factors being pointed to while elsewhere some Democrats have already looked to pin the blame on departing President Joe Biden, who some think took too long to step aside before his successor was tapped for the role.

One Democratic strategist said of the sniping:

People are nervous and they’re trying to cover their ass and get a little ahead of Election Day. It’s based on anxiety, stakes and the unique nature of this cycle. We didn’t have a traditional process for this election. We didn’t have a primary. People just had to fall in line […] it’s not surprising to me (that some of the blame game is happening even before Election Day.)

If Harris loses, “there will be a mad dash to assign blame,” the strategist further added.

The vice president’s decision to pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as running mate will also be challenged if Trump wins the Keystone State.

“[Harris] is going to look real silly for not picking Shapiro,” one former aide in the Obama White House told the outlet.

As Breitbart News reported, Democrat dismay at Harris is not new.

Her campaign in Pennsylvania is in disarray and Democrat leaders are pointing fingers there too, 29 Democrats detailed in a report leaked to Politico and published earlier this month.

The Keystone State, a key battleground in the 2024 cycle, will likely determine who wins the presidency. Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes and campaign chaos there is wreaking terrible results for the Democrats.
House Republicans issued a subpoena this week to the Democratic fundraising platform, ActBlue, as part of an ongoing effort to obtain more information about certain questionable transactions and the platform's process for vetting its donors.

In a letter to ActBlue CEO Regina Wallace-Jones, House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis., requested that the platform turn over more information about its process and policies for verifying donors before Nov. 6, the day after this year's general election.

He said the subpoena is a bid to "safeguard our nation’s elections" and "close loopholes in our campaign finance system," including contributions from donors whose identities were not as stringently vetted.

The request, sent just days ahead of the presidential election, comes as Republicans have expressed mounting concerns over ActBlue’s security policies and processes for vetting donors, which the platform has addressed in recent months with some policy changes.

ActBlue said in a statement Thursday that they have received the inquiry from Steil, "and will respond to address the continued inaccuracies and misrepresentations about our platform, as we have done previously."

"We rigorously protect donors' security and maintain strict anti-fraud compliance practices. We have zero tolerance for fraud on our platform," they added.

VIRGINIA APPEALS TO SCOTUS TO REVERSE JUDGE'S RULING PUTTING POTENTIAL NONCITIZENS BACK ON VOTER ROLLS

Until recently, the platform did not require online donors to submit their credit card verification value (CVV) when donating online — prompting criticism from House Republicans, including Steil, who noted that the lack of verification could allow for "potentially fraudulent and illicit financial activity" by foreign donors.

"We cannot allow foreign actors to influence our elections through campaign financing. The Committee’s investigation uncovered that foreign actors might be taking advantage of ActBlue’s inadequate security protocols," Steil said in his letter.

To date, there has been no evidence or records that such activity has taken place. ActBlue, for its part, has changed its process to require CVV numbers from its donors, a practice people familiar with the process said it began expanding last year.

we The subpoena request comes on the heels of a New York Post report this week that the Treasury Department has identified "hundreds of records of transactions" made on the app that were flagged by banks as potentially suspicious. The department is currently reviewing those records.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., said this week that his office is "working closely with Treasury" to obtain the materials "expeditiously."

Steil and the rest of the House Administration Committee are also working to obtain more information from ActBlue about donations collected in previous months.

On Wednesday, Steil sent a letter to the platform seeking information related to the platform's donor verification policies and potential vulnerabilities.

He also introduced legislation in September seeking to require political committees and donor platforms such as ActBlue to adopt more stringent vetting processes.

The legislation would also prohibit the acceptance of contributions from prepaid gift cards, and adopt a bipartisan FEC recommendation to prohibit individuals from "knowingly aiding or abetting someone" who makes a contribution in the name of another person.

The legislation passed the committee by voice vote, and has not yet been brought to the floor for a full vote.
Roughly 50% of Georgia voters have cast ballots before Election Day so far despite Democrats’ accusations that the state’s voter laws are aimed at making it harder for people to vote.

"It just shows you that they don’t know what they’re talking about," Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Republican, told Fox News Digital Thursday.

"They're just using talking points is all they're doing. All we wanted to do is make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. And that's exactly what we did."

Nearly 3.6 million people, or about 50% of active voters, in the Peach State have cast ballots, either absentee or through early in-person voting, which runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

Georgia voters have already shattered multiple turnout records, but that did little to temper Democratic critics of the new rules for the 2024 presidential cycle put in place by the state’s GOP officials.

"I was just in Georgia. You know they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote?" Vice President Kamala Harris told a rally crowd in Michigan earlier this week. "The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ‘love thy neighbor,’ right?"

Meanwhile, President Biden called Georgia’s election security laws "Jim Crow 2.0" in 2022.

"Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all," he told an audience in Atlanta at the time.

And a group run by Stacey Abrams, who twice lost the gubernatorial race to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, criticized Republicans for arguing there was no voter suppression in the state.

GEORGIA DEMS CHAIR REVEALS MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED GOP VOTERS AS HARRIS WORKS TO BUILD BROAD BASE

"We are thrilled about the strong turnout and especially the 150k newly registered voters who have already turned out, and the 70k voters who have come off the sidelines to vote this year, when they passed four years ago," Lauren Groh-Wargo, CEO of Fair Fight, wrote on X last week.

"But that cannot excuse the fact that the GOP has put up multiple, intentional, damaging roadblocks to deter certain voters. Luckily for democracy, they’ve decided to change lanes - but Republicans don’t get credit because voters have outsmarted their bad intentions."

She said GOP officials’ positivity about the state’s turnout is "all gaslighting" and "patently wrong."

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

Georgia’s Republican-majority legislature passed several laws since 2020 to increase security around the voting process after the Peach State was thrust under scrutiny in the previous presidential race.

Among them were measures to expand the ability to challenge voter eligibility, a rule limiting ballot drop boxes based on population size and, perhaps most notably, a measure forbidding political organizations from handing out food and drinks to voters waiting in line within a certain distance from a polling place.

Election workers are, however, permitted to set up self-serve water stations.

Among the Republicans to push back on Democrats' criticism of the rules was Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office.

"So over 50% of the turnout for 2020 has already voted in Georgia. So for people like Joe Biden & Stacey Abrams, you were wrong saying we had voter suppression here. It’s easy to register & vote in Georgia…and really hard to even try to cheat," Sterling posted on X Oct. 25.

And Kemp called out Harris for her criticism of Georgia’s rule on water and food.

"Sounds like Kamala Harris just can’t handle the truth," Kemp posted on X.

"We made it easier to vote and harder to cheat in Georgia. As a result, more than 3 million Georgians have already voted — that’s 3 million more votes than the Vice President got in the 2024 primaries."
Here's the deal for this week, the very last and final push to Election Day. Ladies and gentlemen, it does feel like 2016 all over again, and for many different reasons. We're talking about Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three states that Donald Trump won by a total of 77,000 votes to become the 45th President of the United States.

He's up against a female opponent who excited and enthused so many women across the country, and other folks. A woman, again, who was supposed to bring along brand-new constituencies into the Democratic Party and expand the electoral map, turn red states blue, increase their take among core constituencies that had been Republican for a very long time. And Donald Trump again, is being outspent. He's facing a hostile, downright dangerous mainstream media in the type of language they use to describe him and his supporters.

It all sounds familiar, but what else sounds familiar is the scent of victory for Donald J. Trump. I think Trump 2016 is Trump 2024. The hunger, the swagger, the underdog, underestimated Donald Trump, who no one thinks could make it again. And there he is, rising from the ashes. This time, literally. He was told in 2015 and 2016, you're not electable, you can't win. He was told that facing 17 qualified men and women for the Republican primary nomination. And he's been told it every single day, every single moment since he left office in January of 2021.

He faced primary opponents in 2023 and 2024. They had debates, two, hosted by FOX Business and Fox News Channel. They had an opportunity to connect with the voters in Iowa, in New Hampshire and South Carolina in these early and swing states. Many of them had outsized money, outsized attention, outsized chances given to them just to stop Donald Trump from ever seeing 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue again.

And yet, here he is as the nominee, surging in the polls with, yes, more money than he had the first few times, but so much more momentum and a true opportunity to continue and complete the political realignment of core constituencies that have traditionally and typically voted Democratic. What a turn of events.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: MARGIN-OF-ERROR PRESIDENTIAL RACE WITH ONE WEEK UNTIL ELECTION DAY

Donald Trump is poised to gain support among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young Americans, Jewish Americans and union households. He doesn't need to win anywhere near 50%, not even 40%, nowhere near that in any of those groups to be the next President of the United States. Ladies and gentlemen, politics is not about biology. It's not even about chemistry. It's about math and science. You need more electoral votes than the other person. And in the down-ballot races for House and Senate, you need one more vote than the other person.

Of course, Kamala Harris can still win, but the race has been slipping away from her for all of October, I can argue from her one debate on September 10th. It was a pretty good 90 minutes for her, but it actually has been a long-term risk and probably a liability for her. Why? Because what we saw on the stage that night in that debate we've never seen since.

There has never been another 90 minutes of Kamala Harris holding forth on policy, looking somewhat optimistic, prevaricating, of course, and equivocating, but at the same time performing in a way that made people in the Democratic Party say, see, this is why we got rid of Joe Biden and replaced him with Kamala Harris. That may have been a mistake.

FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP STILL NARROWLY AHEAD OF HARRIS IN NORTH CAROLINA

Kamala Harris is underperforming Joe Biden's vote totals in many different categories and in a number of these swing states.

Goodness. Remember? What did they say at the time? "Joe Biden must go" after that disastrous debate against Donald Trump. Biden lost that debate, but Trump won that debate, don't forget. And after the June 27 debate, what did the Democratic donors and candidates and officeholders and pundits and the mainstream media, other Democrats, what did they all say? We must get rid of Joe Biden because he's going to turn over the White House to Donald Trump, and he's going to take the House and the Senate with him. Fascinating, wasn't it?

Sounded reasonable at the time to unreasonable people. But the opposite could happen. There could be a red sweep. As I told you last week, Donald Trump is on track for a narrow landslide. Eight thousand here, 12,000 extra there, 22,000 over there. And he can run the tables on Election Day. He can easily win five of those swing states, up to 6 or 7. And there are reasons for that which we're going to dig into in this wonderful episode with Martha MacCallum. But also I'm going to continue to tell you over the next couple of minutes it feels like 2016 all over again for another reason. You. The forgotten man. The forgotten woman. The forgotten child.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE HARD STUFF IS YET TO COME

People now feel invisible to a system that is making them pay too much money for too little in return, that makes a white-knuckle to pay the monthly bills every week. We're not trying to afford luxuries. We're trying to afford everyday consumables. We want a secure border where people aren't coming here illegally. Tens, millions and millions, up to 10 million of them. We don't want new wars abroad. All the predictions about Donald Trump becoming the 45th president. They're trying all over again. He's a fascist. He's a Nazi. He loves Hitler. He is Hitler. They're insulting him because they're insulting you who support him. Don't let that happen.

You know who you are. No political person, no candidate, no party ever made a plan for you. God did have faith in that plan. Get to the polls if you haven't already. Maybe you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who have already voted. Maybe you're someone who's still going to vote, but I'm encouraging you to vote because the most equalizing factor in our democracy. One person, one vote. Your vote is your voice. Your vote is your choice. We're going to have World War III. The stock market's going to crash. All these predictions about Trump, inflation, new wars everywhere. None of it was true.

'TREATED YOU LIKE GARBAGE': TRUMP USES BIDEN CRITICISM AS RALLYING CRY IN BATTLEGROUND NORTH CAROLINA

They're making those predictions again. And once again, they're trying to denigrate and castigate you, his voters. He's right. He's just in the way. They're not just going after him. They're going after you. Kamala Harris is a sign of the times. Donald Trump is a metaphor for America. When you're knocked down, when someone wishes to do you harm and pulls the trigger literally or figuratively, do you fall down and stay there or do you get back up? America, do you pump your fists in the air and say, "Fight, fight, fight"? That's the question we all have in our mind.

Let's talk about the polls and the RealClearPolitics average.

Trump has a 0.1% lead in the popular vote. But at this point, that small, small, minuscule lead is a huge one. Why? Biden was at 7.4% and Hillary Clinton was at 4.6%. It is astonishing that the popular vote is even in play. It has been consistently out of reach of Republicans since 2004. It is mostly in play because of Trump. He's improving his margins in Republican-leaning states like Texas and Florida. Compared to the previous two elections when he was the nominee, and he also appears to be cutting his deficits in blue states like California, New York and even places like New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia. The Electoral College, we know that it's not the popular vote. It's the Electoral College – how you do or don't become the president.

TRUMP CAMP TAKES VICTORY LAP FOLLOWING ELECTION CASE LEGAL WIN IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

Right now, the RealClearPolitics average shows everything turning up Trump literally, albeit marginally. The two best states for Trump right now in the RCP average is Arizona, which Fox News Power Rankings just moved to lean Republican, and Georgia, where Trump leads Harris by 2% on average. In the early vote in Arizona, Republicans have a 100,000 vote advantage over the Democrats. That eliminates the Democrats early vote advantage that they've been able to claim in the past two election cycles.

In Nevada, a similar trend is unfolding. Forty thousand more Republicans have voted earlier than Democrats. That is something that Nevada has never seen in the modern era. And in North Carolina, where Republicans have reduced the Democratic advantage in new registrations, Republicans are also outvoting Democrats. In 2020, Democrats outvoted Republicans by 300,000 votes at this point in the race. And now Republicans are outvoting Democrats. Boy, Donald Trump telling people, make a plan to vote. Vote on Election Day, if you like, but vote early if you feel comfortable. Vote early through the mail. Vote early through the drop box. Vote early at the polls. That's paying off.

FOX NEWS POLL: MORE HARRIS THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK VOTES WILL BE COUNTED ACCURATELY & WILL ACCEPT OUTCOME

The Lion Board and the rest of the kingdom are following with the Trump team feeling confident in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina. They still would need to pick off one of those three states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, to get it over to 70 Electoral College. So right now, that blue wall, there's three states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – that Trump won in 2016 and Biden reclaimed in 2020 that are seeing the tightest polling in the cycle. They're very white states. You would have thought Kamala Harris would make a play, do much better in the racially diverse states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada. She is not. She stuck without "Scranton Joe" going to Scranton.

She stuck without the Senate candidates in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan wanting to campaign much with her there bear hugging Donald Trump, saying, I don't own the electric vehicle. The million people to judge demand that you buy. I've been voting with Trump on trade. I'm bipartisan. I really am. So she's there by herself in her billions to make the case. Trump leads each of those states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, by half a percentage point. It's worth noting that at this point in 2016, Hillary Clinton led all three states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan – by more than 5% and went on to lose all three. Now, as I said, and we know, Trump still needs to pick off at least one of those so-called blue wall seats to win.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS ERASES TRUMP’S LEAD ON THE ECONOMY IN MICHIGAN

Right now, he's trying to squeeze Harris from the left and the right, and it's working. He's improving and maintaining his margins in the rural counties, and he's making gains in urban counties like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, largely because of his gains among minority voters especially, but not exclusively male voters. Donald Trump doesn't need to get anywhere near 50, 40, 30% in those urban areas to actually win the state.

Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is bleeding support from traditional core Democratic constituencies like Blacks, Hispanics, union households, Jewish Americans and even Catholic voters. In Michigan, that includes Arab American voters, 100,000 of whom refused to vote for her and Biden in the primaries. Therefore, Harris is banking on one big route to 270. She needs to overperform with White college graduates in suburban counties. There is some evidence that she is able to do that and hold on to these blue wall states. CNN, for example, recently analyzed the polling averages and shows Harris doubling Joe Biden's margin in 2020 among white college grads. That's a little scary. And that will be the telltale sign on election night.

MAJORITY OF VETERANS POLLED SUPPORT RE-ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP: 'WE WANT TRUMP BACK'

How is the race looking in suburban counties, big counties surrounding big urban counties like Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee? Let's take a look at the House and Senate, because, after all, President Trump will need a red sweep. To be able to get things done and to avoid impeachment in the first couple of days by 30 Democratic led House and Senate, if every single lean, likely and safe seat went each party's way, the Republicans would start at 207 and the Democrats would start at 203, according to Cook Political Report.

That leaves control of the House to be decided by 25 toss-up seats, 14 currently held by q Republican, 11 currently held by a Democrat. Of the 14 seats Republicans are defending, only four districts were won by Trump in 2020. California 41. Iowa one. Iowa three. Pennsylvania 10. Biden won ten of these seats, including seven of the seats by over 5%. California 13. California 22. California 27. California 45. New Nebraska two. New York four. Oregon five. Why do I say this? Remember where Trump's been recently? Coachella, California. Long Island. New York. Madison Square Garden.

Why is he going to non-swing states, Kellyanne? Because he's smart and he knows that the House majority that the Republicans got in 2022 ran through California in New York, of the 10 seats Democrats are defending in the House, four were won by Trump.

TRUMP, HARRIS MAKE FINAL PITCHES TO VOTERS IN HIGH-STAKES BATTLEGROUND STATE IN FINAL DAYS OF CYCLE

Biden won seven of them and only three where he had comfortable wins. As goes the race nationally for president may go the race for Republicans. Ladies and gentlemen, we've had three consecutive election cycles, 2018, 2020 and 2022, where we did not know who controlled the House of Representatives until December. That could happen again.

Or we can have an early night. Quickly look at the US Senate – best electoral map for the GOP in a decade and probably for the next decade. Excellent candidates having been recruited in most, if not all, of these places.

West Virginia, open seat, the Manchin seat safe. Republican Jim Justice will be the next United States senator from West Virginia.

So we're feeling really bullish about the House and Senate as well. Again, no red wave, but a red sweep helps President Trump legislatively accomplish more of that agenda.

The race for control of the House is tight. The classic political jumpball. It’s hard to judge which way the House will tilt.

Republicans are heavily favored to win the Senate. But nearly every competitive Senate contest is razor-thin. Pennsylvania. Ohio. Michigan. Wisconsin. Texas is suddenly in play. Some observers would never rule out Florida. Montana appears to be slipping away from Democrats. Democrats seem in good shape in Arizona. But what happens if former President Trump wins Arizona? Republicans might seize the Senate majority with a robust 53 or 54 seats – even if all of these races are decided by just a percentage point or two.

But, we could be talking about a very different scenario for control of the House and Senate had President Biden not withdrawn from his reelection bid in mid-July.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE HARD STUFF IS YET TO COME

On July 21, the President said he would stand down because it was "in the best interest of my party and the country."

House and Senate Democrats breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Although many wouldn’t publicly admit it – even now – they feared that Mr. Biden had lost more than a step. He appeared tired. Utterly incoherent at times during the late June debate with former President Trump. Few were excited. They fretted that another Biden candidacy would drain all enthusiasm from the Democratic side. Former President Trump would bludgeon Mr. Biden in the race for the White House. But what truly petrified them was the impact of President Biden standing for re-election on down ballot races.

Competitive Senate seats in Pennsylvania and Ohio? Probably down the drain.

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., prognosticated that the GOP would pick up several dozen seats in 2022. McCarthy may have been off by two years. Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket likely would have triggered a blood-letting in House contests.

Now, the House is anybody’s ballgame.

Biden campaign officials met with House Democrats at the Democratic National Committee on a sizzling morning in mid-July. Some senior House Democrats like Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., declared he was "ridin’ with Biden" as he entered the forum. But the ground was already shifting.

WHO'S IN CHARGE: THE MUDDY HISTORY OF THE 50-50 SENATE

The president stubbornly stayed in the race. But former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is always mindful of the caucus she used to lead. Pelosi understood the political catastrophe which probably awaited Democrats if the President didn’t step aside. The San Francisco Democrat couldn’t publicly call on Mr. Biden to drop out. Pelosi would be more artful than that. She would quietly urge concerned Democrats to speak out. Without directly saying anything, a groundswell of Congressional Democrats began to demand the President bow out.

A group of Biden advisers huddled with moribund Senate Democrats at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) on a sweltering hot afternoon in mid-July. Almost every Senate Democrat who attended tried to avoid the press. In fact, many had drivers take them the several hundred yards from the Senate wing of the Capitol to the DSCC across the street. All to duck the press corps. Their silence spoke volumes about President Biden remaining in the race.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even visited with President Biden in Delaware, just hours before the assassination attempt of former President Trump in Pennsylvania. News of Schumer’s audience with the president disappeared into the milieu of news coverage of the disaster in Butler, Penn. But Schumer feared a GOP blowout if Mr. Biden stuck around.

The deft touch of the former Speaker was classic Pelosi. A read of the climate. No fingerprints. A wink and a nod. A green light to others to do something. Someone close to Pelosi once described to me the former Speaker’s subtlety: "You will be bleeding out and never even realize you’ve been cut."

When Pelosi served as Speaker, allies and foes alike always wondered in awe how she got the votes. Helping orchestrate the exit of President Biden from the presidential sweepstakes was no different. Just switch the improbable into the inevitable.

A longtime confidante of Pelosi confided to me years ago that Pelosi knew how to gingerly prod House Democrats to move constituents in their districts. The constituents would then support the given issue – giving cover to Members to vote yes and not face blowback. The base now supported the issue. But not without some cunning engineering from Pelosi.

AFGHAN CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT RAISES QUESTIONS, FEARS FROM LAWMAKERS: ‘THIS IS REAL’

That crafty tactic was also at play in convincing Mr. Biden to withdraw. After a few weeks of massaging this behind the scenes, the President understood he had no alternative but to quit. Otherwise, he likely would likely lose. Congressional Democrats would be resigned to their fate.

Vice President Harris may win. But Democrats never had a primary season to settle on their nominee. Sure. Harris likely would have been favored initially in a conventional primary process. That’s simply because she ran for president before and has served nearly four years as Vice President. But the quick pivot to Harris was in the interest of efficiency. After President Biden stepped aside, Democrats had an automatic nominee-in-waiting who was credible, qualified and whose resume resonated with the party. So, switching mid-stream to Harris was about as seamless a transition as possible.

But, just as importantly, handing over the keys to Harris immediately infused congressional Democrats and the base with much-needed energy. The change buoyed Democrats in ways which were impossible under President Biden. Suddenly, congressional Democrats were back in the game.

Republicans have a strong chance of winning the Senate on Tuesday night. But had Mr. Biden remained at the top of the ticket, Democrats faced a tidal wave. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., appears to be on the ropes. There are tight races involving Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and Bob Casey, D-Penn. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., is in a dogfight in Michigan with former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., for the seat of retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. Even Rep. Colin Allred, D-Tex., has a puncher’s chance in his Senate race with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex. It’s conceivable that Democrats may have lost most or all of those races had President Biden remained on the ballot. But because of the president’s decision, Democrats are now competitive in all of those and may win a few – even if they lose control of the Senate.

The same is true in the House. It’s nip-and-tuck. Yes. Republicans might hold their narrow majority – or even gain seats in a best-case scenario. But Democrats are well-positioned in every battleground district to potentially gain ground. That wouldn’t be the case had the Ppresident stuck around.

So this is the fundamental lesson of the seismic decision by President Biden in July to quit: it may have bolstered the chances of Democrats holding the White House. But the real dividend of the president’s decision might be realized on Capitol Hill. Not by holding the Senate and winning the House. But by avoiding an ugly blowout.
Republican Florida Rep. Byron Donalds accused CNN host John Berman Thursday of misleading his viewers on Republican nominee Donald Trump’s statements about women during a testy exchange.

Berman played an edited, trimmed down clip of Trump saying he will protect women “whether they like it or not” in reference to many women falling victim to rape and murder as a result of the border crisis. Donalds said the clip is “grossly inaccurate” and out of context, stating that Trump is promising to protect women from the various tragedies that have taken place as a result of the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“John, that is grossly inaccurate what you just played. Play the full clip. Play it in its context,” Donalds said. “He’s talking about the tragedy at our southern border that led to the death of Jocelyn Nungaray. Jocelyn’s mother endorsed Donald Trump because she fully believes that if Donald Trump was president, her daughter would be alive. And so what he was talking about, I’m gonna protect women, I’m gonna protect children,’ and he was really telling a joke about how some of the staff said ‘no, no, don’t say you’ll protect women because they’ll take it out of context.’ Obviously, what CNN is doing right now, is taking it out of context.”

“No, no, no, you have the exact right context here, congressman,” Berman replied. “Congressman, you just explained the exact right context was with Donald Trump’s story was telling people how people close to him, his advisers were telling him not to use that type of language to say ‘I’m going to be your protector.'”



The CNN host pointed to former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley criticizing the Trump campaign for appealing to male voters and not sending a message that will win over women. (RELATED: ‘Are You Out Of Your Mind?’: Byron Donalds Throws Down With CNBC Host Over Trump Rally At Madison Square Garden)

“John, you need to stop,” Donalds said.

“So you’re telling me there’s no concern from Nikki Haley or as clearly as Donald Trump said, from people close to him in his campaign, about the type of language that he’s using,” Berman said.

Donalds then named 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley and 37-year-old Rachel Morin, who all mercilessly died at the hands of illegal immigrants under the Biden-Harris administration.

“Donald Trump is going to protect women in our country. He is going to protect children in our country,” the congressman said. “Under Kamala Harris, we have lost 350,000 children in the United States. We’ve lost them, John, talk about that. What I will tell you is once again, you’re gonna clip 5 seconds out of an hour speech and not provide context. This is why the American people frankly are frustrated with media because you guys play games, you take things out of context, you don’t explain them clearly, and you want to get caught up in some antics.”

“The heart of what Donald Trump said, very clearly is, he’s gonna protect the women of our country because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have refused to protect the women of our country and a president should protect women and all Americans and that’s what he’s gonna do,” Donalds continued.

The former president said during a Wednesday rally in Wisconsin that his advisers believed women would not like him promising that he would protect them, leading him to say at the rally that he will protect women anyways if he is reelected.

Federal immigration law under the Biden-Harris administration allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to “parole” migrants instead of detaining them for “humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,” which has been challenged by many Republican-led states. Illegal encounters exceeded 2 million in the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, largely surpassing encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Trump administration, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Vice President Kamala Harris once said in 2021 that former President Donald Trump represents “a bubbling-up of a contagion that had been in the American system for a long time,” according to a screenshot of the book “This Will Not Pass” by Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns.

The vice president had a conversation with then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2021 in which she asked Harris how Europe could “be confident that Trump was an aberration,” according to a screenshot of the book shared by Executive Vice President of Public Affairs of Targeted Victory Alberto Martinez. Harris responded, according to the book, by explaining what a “contagion” is and equating it to the former president. (RELATED: ‘I’m Nervous’: Sense Of Unease Persists Among Harris Rally Crowd)

“Harris’s answer was measured and vivid. Gesturing to her own arms, the vice president said sometimes people have an illness just beneath the skin. They can keep it under control with the right medicine, but sometimes it breaks out and appears on the surface,” the screenshot of the book reads.

“Trump, she said, represented a bubbling-up of a contagion that had been in the American system for a long time. And Harris acknowledged that the underlying illness was likely not gone just because Trump had lost the election,” it continues.

In 2021 Kamala told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Trump and his supporters were “an illness just beneath the skin” and a “bubbling up of a contagion.” Reporters now pretending that Biden and Harris would never suggest that half the country is garbage is risible. pic.twitter.com/i2HTDs0wlB — Alberto E. Martinez (@albertemartinez) October 30, 2024

In the final weeks of the campaign, the Harris campaign has resorted to calling Trump a fascist and comparing the former president’s event Sunday at Madison Square Garden to that of a 1939 Nazi rally. The vice president held her closing argument at the Ellipse, where Trump addressed his supporters before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Riot. Harris, while calling for unity, said the former president is “obsessed with revenge” and is a “petty tyrant” that would use the military on his enemies.

The vice president also previously held an unexpected press conference to respond to former White House chief of staff John Kelly’s claims that Trump would rule like a fascist. Both the New York Times and The Atlantic published stories Oct. 22 detailing interviews with Kelly, who claimed that his former boss said Hitler “did some good things,” wanted generals like the Nazi dictator had and would rule like a fascist. The Trump campaign denied both stories and former officials and other subjects of The Atlantic piece went on the record to deny other elements of the article.

“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said at the press conference. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.”

The vice president has moved to distance herself from remarks President Joe Biden made during her closing arguments, in which he called Trump supporters “garbage.”

“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.

“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.

The Vice President’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller’s request for comment.
North Carolina’s Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein, who is running for governor, refuses to say whether he agrees with President Joe Biden that supporters of former President Donald Trump are “garbage,” or with Kamala Harris’ campaign that they are Nazis.

Neither Stein’s campaign nor his official attorney general office would respond to multiple requests for comment from The Federalist asking if he agreed with his party’s leaders that millions of Americans — roughly half the country — are inhuman and akin to “the most evil mass murderers in history” (the words Trump used to describe Harris’ attacks on him and his supporters).

The North Carolina Democrat’s refusal to distance himself from Biden’s and Harris’ invective stands in stark contrast to other Democrats running statewide campaigns in swing states who have stood in opposition to the people their party has chosen to represent the American people.

Stein campaigned with Harris yesterday in Raleigh, thanking her for coming out to the state where half the voters, in her mind, are Nazis and fascists.

North Carolina is fired up and ready to vote! Thanks, @KamalaHarris, for joining us in Raleigh today. pic.twitter.com/N67Nl3kFa8 — Josh Stein (@JoshStein_) October 30, 2024

It is unclear if Stein agrees, and he has not commented on his party’s divisive and dangerous messaging.

Earlier this week, Biden went on CNN to make a closing argument for Harris just days before the election, calling millions whom he still represents as president “garbage.”

“The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump’s] supporters,” Biden said.

While the White House attempted to walk back the statement and even released a bogus “transcript” selectively punctuated to make it appear that Biden had not labeled Trump supporters “garbage,” video of Biden’s statement quickly renders these narratives unbelievable.

Sometimes the Democrat elite tell us what they really think of us. Hillary Clinton thinks we are “deplorables”. Joe Biden thinks we are “garbage.” Kamala Harris thinks we are so stupid as to believe her lies.



We deserve better. Vote Trump pic.twitter.com/cwEBnGSbLj — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) October 30, 2024

Even Harris was forced to attempt to distance herself from Biden calling their constituents “garbage,” giving a mealy-mouthed defense of Biden saying he “clarified his comments,” but that she “strongly disagree[s] with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.” She further said that the work she does is “about representing all the people whether they support me or not.”

Harris’ response is ironic though, because Biden’s “garbage” comments come after the Harris campaign’s own closing arguments saying, with the help of a corporate media information op, that Trump and his supporters are Nazis and that Trump himself is a fascist.

Just last week, Harris directly tied Adolf Hitler to Trump using debunked information to imply that Trump would murder millions and go after judges, journalists, and election officials as president.

“It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans,” Harris said. “All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.”

Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., likened a completely peaceful Trump rally at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi rally held there in the 1930s.

“Donald Trump’s got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden. There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden,” Walz said. “And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there.”

Walz’s statement not only likens Trump to a Nazi leader, but every attendee to supporters of Nazis. Walz’s words also echo the sentiments of 2016 failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (whose husband, former President Bill Clinton, the Harris campaign has trotted out to rallies), who said that Trump and his supporters were “reenacting the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939.”

The left-wing media, dedicated to election interference on behalf of the Harris campaign, lent its voice to the Nazi rally smears as well, with MSNBC actually airing footage of the 1939 rally during its coverage of the Trump rally. Axios did its part, too, saying that while the two rallies were different, they were actually very similar.

Harris has not walked back her campaign’s own dangerous rhetoric or condemned her friends in the media for their Nazi comparison.

“While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate.” Trump posted on social media. “She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters ‘garbage.’ You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.”

“I am proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history,” he continued. “We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It is my desire to be the President of all the people.”

As The Federalist reported, the Harris campaign does not appear to be doing well in North Carolina, as the campaign has pulled millions of dollars in ads out of the state as Harris drops in the polls and Republicans swamp Democrats in early voting.

Some speculate the Harris campaign is turning its focus to neighboring Virginia in the home stretch. Virginia has been a Democrat stronghold statewide for years until the election of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., in 2021, and the state has voted for a Democrat presidential candidate in every election since 2004.

Stein, however, is leading his opponent Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, R-N.C., by a significant margin after scandals rocked Robinson’s campaign.

Ohio GOP Gov. Mike DeWine claimed that the economic progress made in Springfield would be lost if the thousands of Haitians currently living there were to leave.

Springfield attracted widespread media attention following viral online claims about Haitian migrants allegedly eating pets, and many longtime residents saying the vast influx of migrants has caused strain to the city’s infrastructure. However, the Republican governor on Wednesday said the thousands of Haitians who’ve made Springfield home are essential for the city’s job sector. (RELATED: ‘Trump Is The Only Candidate’: Hundreds Of Former Nat Sec Officials Endorse Trump, Say Harris Dismantled Border)

“I was asked the question several weeks ago: What would happen if all the Haitians were gone from Springfield?’ DeWine said during a press conference that pertained to declining overdose deaths in Ohio. “And the reality is that some of the economic progress that we have made at Springfield will go away.”

“Haitians came here to work,” the Republican governor said. “They were hired because there was work. They were hired because there were openings that could not be filled by companies.”

Springfield was thrust into the national spotlight in September after it was alleged on a social media page for local residents that a Haitian migrant had been spotted butchering a pet cat for consumption. That claim gained further attention when former President Donald Trump made mention of it it during his presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Daily Caller News Foundation visited Springfield and spoke to longtime residents about the attention surrounding the town. While no one who spoke with the DCNF could confirm claims of pet-eating by migrants, many locals expressed dismay at the sheer number of Haitian migrants entering the relatively small town — with estimates saying 15,000 to 20,000 Haitians descended into Springfield in just the last several years, overwhelming a city of fewer than 60,000.

The enormous influx of Haitian migrants has strained the city’s transportation, education and other social services, locals told the DCNF. City officials have also spoken out about the logistical hurdles resulting from the population spike, with the city manager in July warning of a looming housing crisis in Springfield and asking the federal government for help.

Trump, who has made border enforcement a hallmark of his campaign, has previously pledged to end Temporary Protected Status for Haitians and “bring them back” to their country.

However, a spokesperson for the governor’s office on Thursday told the DCNF that they are unaware of any formal plan by Trump’s team to deport the Haitians living in Springfield.

There were roughly 2.1 million migrant encounters along the U.S-Mexico border in fiscal year 2024, according to the latest data revealed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The latest numbers put the total number of migrant encounters at the southern border during the Biden-Harris administration at approximately 8.5 million — which does not include the roughly half a million migrants flown into the country via the White House’s CHNV program.

The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023, according to data tracked by CBP.

It’s been truly remarkable to watch Kamala Harris’ closing unity message get royally derailed by President Joe Biden’s Freudian slip about “garbage” just one week before the 2024 election wraps up. It’s been even more amazing to watch the regime’s foot soldiers lie so vociferously about the statement anyone with working ears could hear clearly on video — amazing because the CYA mission won’t work.

After insult comic Tony Hinchcliffe joked about Puerto Rico being a floating pile of trash at a recent Trump rally — among a zillion other indiscriminate zings — Democrats tried unsuccessfully to gin up a controversy about Republican racism. But that plan epically backfired when Joe Biden talked about Puerto Rico on a Zoom call and ended up calling half of Americans garbage instead.

“The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump’s] supporters.”

October surprise, baby! It seems like poetic justice that Biden, who was knifed in the back by his own party to undemocratically install Kamala Harris as the Democrat nominee, was the one to deliver what could be the fatal blow to Harris’ seemingly faltering campaign.

The White House and accomplice media immediately launched into spin mode. Joe Biden’s X account said he was talking not about people, but about “hateful rhetoric.” His press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre “clarified” that when Biden said Trump supporters are garbage, “He was not calling Trump supporters garbage.” Got it. Taxpayer-funded NPR thought the most important part of POTUS demonizing half the country was that “Republicans pounce[d],” and the network’s media correspondent tried really hard to hear whether Biden called Trumpers trash but concluded Robert Hur-style that the president is just “an octogenarian with a stutter.” CBS News (of election interference infamy) and The Washington Post couldn’t quite sus out the mysterious meaning of “supporters.”

Politico’s Jonathan Lemire just blatantly lied about Biden’s quote, writing, “Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.” The best part about that false statement is that the White House’s own fake transcript of Biden’s comments completely contradicts it. According to the White House — and all the corrupt media laughably running with the spin — Biden didn’t say “supporters,” he said “supporter’s.” There’s an apostrophe. Mmmk.

Here’s the rub for Democrats. Their problem isn’t that their leader just said the quiet part out loud. It’s that they’ve been so loud about their disdain for Trump supporters for so long that nobody is buying the walkbacks.

Just last week, The Atlantic came out with a hit piece comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler. As my colleague John Daniel Davidson wrote, the smear “was immediately denied on the record by all the people who were in the room with Trump,” but the psyop was already complete, intended “to justify mass post-election violence if Trump wins in November, to signal activists to reject the results of the election, to divide the military, and to coax an insurgency out of the radical left-wing base of the Democratic Party and unleash it on American cities.”

So Kamala Harris took her cue. Standing on the steps of the Naval Observatory, she repeated the Trump-Hitler comparison, which directly implies his followers are Nazis. Hillary Clinton and Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, made the Nazi smear even more explicit. Harris has also called the leader of the Republican Party a fascist, which tells you what she thinks of his voters. When Anderson Cooper asked her at a town hall last week, “Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” she said, “Yes, I do. Yes, I do.”

This style of vitriol toward Republican voters isn’t new, of course. Hillary Clinton branded Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables” eight years ago, and the “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it” slurs have run on a loop ever since.

It’s unclear how exactly Kamala Harris figures she’s going to unite with Nazis in her promise to “represent all Americans.” It’s like answering the “would you kill baby Hitler” question with an answer about adoption. She probably means Biden-style unity, which is actually condemning one’s opponents as “extreme MAGA Republicans” and then persecuting them.

But that cognitive dissonance isn’t the point. The point is that when Democrat leaders tell you who they really are — or who they think you are — you should believe them.

They don’t just think Trump is Hitler. They think you’re garbage.
Wisconsin’s far-left senator doesn’t want anything to do with President Joe Biden’s trash talk about Trump supporters.

Perhaps a tight reelection bid in a battleground state has something to do with Sen. Tammy Baldwin distancing herself from the politically moribund president’s incendiary comments.

Biden made the disparaging remarks Tuesday at a Hispanic voter activist event. He took aim at comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke at former President Donald Trump’s New York City campaign rally in which Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as an “island of garbage.”

“[J]ust the other day, a speaker at [Trump’s] rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. … The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said.

While the White House feebly attempted to “clarify” Biden’s Hillary Clinton-style insult of half of the electorate, video shows the octogenarian gaffe machine doing what he does best.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democrats’ presidential nominee after liberals suddenly realized that the president is a cognitive dumpster fire who would cost them the election, attempted to distance herself from the comments.

“He clarified his comments but, let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism based on who they vote for,” Harris told reporters Wednesday, hours after delivering her Trump-villifying “closing arguments” Tuesday evening near the White House.

A Tale of Two Tammys?

Wisconsin’s junior senator does “not agree with President Biden,” according to her campaign.

“Tammy is fighting for all Wisconsinites no matter who they are or who they vote for,” said Andrew Mamo, spokesman for Tammy Baldwin for Senate, in a statement to The Federalist.

Baldwin’s Republican opponent, Madison businessman Eric Hovde, reminded Badger State voters that the leftist senator has previously shared Biden’s point of view.

Eight years ago, Baldwin accused Trump voters of failing a “moral test” in supporting the Republican presidential candidate.

“Donald Trump might be one of the most offensive and hateful and unacceptable presidential candidates we’ve ever had,” Baldwin proclaimed in a June 2016 speech to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, as the Free Beacon reported. “So what does that say about the people who support him?”

“The President of the United States and the Junior U.S. Senator from Wisconsin both CAN’T STAND half of Wisconsin’s voters. It’s time for change,” Hovde wrote on his X account.

Republican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming said Biden and Baldwin “admitted out loud” what Republicans have long known.

“Democrats in Washington look down on working families, expecting their support in exchange for nothing better than empty promises of unity and positive vibes,” Schimming said in a statement. “From ‘cling to guns or religion‘ to calling political opponents ‘deplorables‘ and ‘garbage’, their disdain for half the country is undeniable and will be their undoing on Election Day.”

Baldwin, a two-term senator, leads Hovde by a slim 2 percentage points (49 percent to 47 percent), according to the latest battleground poll from CNN and SSRS. The incumbent leads the money chase, with Democrat ad spending on the race since Labor Day at $55.8 million compared to $48.5 million by Republicans, according to Politico. Cook Political Report rates the race a toss-up, a potentially huge get for Republicans who stand a good chance of taking control of the Senate.

“Baldwin’s polling lead in the race has shrunk in recent weeks, prompting some concern from Democrats. The presidential race will also have a significant impact in this state,” Politico opined.

The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Harris with a razor-thin 0.2 percent advantage over Trump in Wisconsin.

Rep. Mark Pocan, a firebrand Madison leftist, did not return The Federalist’s request seeking comment on Biden’s berating of Trump supporters. Neither did Rep. Gwen Moore, a far-left Democrat who represents Milwaukee. Both congressional seats are solidly blue.

The campaign for Peter Barca, a Democrat running against Wisconsin 1st Congressional District Rep. Bryan Steil, also did not return a request for comment.

JPMorgan Chase is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly defamed a man based on false allegations from an obscure left-wing blog post, according to a complaint provided to the Daily Caller.

The feud began when a left-wing blog, The Stern Facts, posted an article by Patrick Simpson. The post falsely claimed that Florida’s Jacob Gitman and his business Monarch Air Group, LLC were affiliated with the Russian Mafia and former President Donald Trump, according to an executive summary obtained by the Caller.

Monarch has contracts with the federal government and received $160,000 from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the past twelve months, according to USA Spending. Monarch’s website states it is a private jet and air charter company that “provides mission critical supplies” to the federal government.

The small blog has not posted anything since 2020, yet it managed to allegedly catch the attention of Chase Bank. Simpson’s post claimed “judges in multiple states” asserted that Gitman’s business was a front for the Russian mob.

But according to the blogger himself, this claim was fabricated. Nonetheless, Chase seemingly used the blog post to help justify it’s decision to de-bank Gitman.

Gitman’s other business — Sinai Holdings — was allegedly defamed as a result and lost its $600 million credit line, according to the 2023 lawsuit. Sinai operates various clinics, medical device manufacturers and surgical centers.

He’s abusing the powers of the presidency#WhyWeMustImpeachTrumpin7Words — The Stern Facts (@thesternfacts) October 1, 2017

Chase’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Interdiction List Request provided “negative media” as the only explanation for allegedly placing Gitman and Monarch on the list, according to a motion for relief from judgment filed last year. The other reason was reportedly blacked out two separate times.

The plaintiffs learned the “negative media” referred to Simpson’s now-retracted blog post, the documents stated.

Prior to placing a person and/or business on the list, Chase’s policy is to find “corroborated open source negative media” with allegations of terrorist financing, money laundering or other charges that warrant interdiction, according to the motion. One example would be an indictment from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the document notes.

“Chase did not do anything to corroborate the raw allegations of the Blog Post, which fallaciously claimed that judges said Monarch is a Russian Mafia front,” the documents added.

Monarch and Gitman sued the blog’s publisher, Grant Stern, who is the executive director of the group Occupy Democrats, according to his Twitter account.

During his deposition, Simpson admitted the article was false. He also testified he was unaware of any evidence that Gitman, his family or his companies were affiliated with the Russian Mafia, according to documents.

“So, we sued that blogger, and he admitted under oath that he has no evidence for that,” Gitman’s attorney, Josh Kon of Stok Kon + Braverman, told the Caller.

According to Stok Kon + Braverman’s executive summary, Chase’s internal documents reportedly said: “[d]uring the trial, the US judge stated that in addition to their legitimate activities as airline companies, that [the business was] also used as fronts for the Russian Mafia.”

The Caller reached out to JPMorgan Chase’s legal contact, Trish Wexler, who declined to comment.

Sinai Holdings LLC was placed on Chase’s “Interdiction List,” the lawsuit alleged.

Chase allegedly cancels transactions sent to list members and forwards a message claiming the transaction cannot be completed “due to Sanctions and/or internal JPMC policy,” the lawsuit claimed.

The U.S. Treasury Department oversees the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which deals with sanctions against certain foreign countries, terrorists and various other threats to the United States, according to the office’s website.

Chase created an internal department — the Sanctions Services Utility (SSU) — to relay to customers and financial institutions when they attempt to transfer money to sanctioned countries or entities, according to the lawsuit.

However, the lawsuit asserts these transactions were never canceled due to OFAC investigations or sanctions. The complaint further alleges that Chase “falsely” told the plaintiff’s business associates, including Sinai’s lender, that Chase could not send money due to an OFAC investigation and sanctions.

“So essentially, it’s like a — defamation policy structure, like a defamation policy framework, that anybody that’s pulled into the web is automatically defamed,” Kon told the Caller.

The message also says the cancellation involves an “OFAC investigation,” and the subject line of the message allegedly includes “OFAC investigation – Cancellation of Payment,” according to the complaint.

“When powerful forces in government use financial institutions to blacklist people with dissenting views, it not only restricts basic financial freedoms, but it also sends a powerful suppressive message to those who dare to speak against the prevailing narrative of the day,” Bledsoe told the Caller. “It’s unconstitutional, it’s an extrajudicial limitation of free speech and religious exercise, and it sends us down a dark path towards totalitarianism.”

Chase told business associates of Gitman and his company — including Sinai’s lender — it could not send money because of an OFAC investigation and sanctions, according to the lawsuit.

Chase’s interdiction list is run by its Gibraltar Financial Intelligence Unit (GFIU) department.

In addition to the blog post, Chase’s GFIU “wildly speculated that monies Monarch sent between entities” were potentially involved in possible interference during the 2016 presidential election, according to the 2023 motion.

Gitman testified the bank was motivated by “personal and political ill-will,” documents said. The motion stated the bank’s redactions attributed the Russian interference claim to Simpson’s blog post.

Democratic California Congresswoman Maxine Waters subpoenaed Monarch but “found nothing suspicious,” according to documents. She reportedly used Monarch afterwards for two flights to a foreign country, the motion stated. Chase allegedly refused to testify about the subpoena.

Gitman and Sinai lost business and their lender rescinded its loans after Chase said the transactions were cancelled because of OFAC sanctions, according to documents.

As a result of the alleged defamation, Gitman and his company’s bank accounts at institutions like Bank of America were closed, the complaint notes. Sinai failed to make payments due to losing its credit line, and the plaintiff’s lender rescinded its loans under Sinai’s credit line because of Chase’s statements, according to documents.

Gitman and Sinai could not pay bills for construction projects or rent, and they are being sued by pharmaceutical companies for $12 million for outstanding fees, according to the complaint.

“So, all in all, the blog made up something about what judges never said and Chase used that false and uncorroborated claim, and added its own wild Russian interference claims, to interdict and cancel all transactions around the world,” Stok Kon + Braverman stated in its executive summary of the case.

The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against Chase to stop publishing “falsities” about OFAC sanctions when it cancels transactions related to Gitman and his company. (RELATED: Biden Admin Revives Russian Election Interference Bogeyman Just In Time For November)

🚨 Representatives from JPMorgan Chase attended virtually all DHS meetings about federal government efforts to censor disinformation on social media. Are they laying the groundwork for “de-banking” to become an (even more) mainstream strategy?

https://t.co/yTIeLvQjr2 pic.twitter.com/BFehCIupDQ — Natalie Winters (@nataliegwinters) October 31, 2022

This is not the first instance of Chase coming under fire for alleged “de-banking.” Last year, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) exposed how JPMorgan Chase de-banked the National Committee for Religious Freedom by canceling its checking account in 2022.

“The Supreme Court and legal scholars have consistently linked financial freedom with the ability for citizens to exercise their first amendment free speech rights,” Eric Bledsoe, Senior Fellow for the Foundation for Government Accountability, said in a statement to the Caller.

Republican Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody demanded in 2023 that JP Morgan Chase stop its alleged discrimination against religious and political beliefs.

“This latest instance of politically-motivated de-banking should send chills down the spine of anyone who values the constitution and core American values,” Bledsoe told the Caller.

“Policymakers at the state and federal levels have the ability to ban this practice and the power to protect their constituents from the same fate.”

John Eastman, an attorney for Trump, previously told the Caller that he was “de-banked” by Bank of America and USAA. Eastman came under fire for advising Trump around the 2020 presidential election and told the Caller he was “99.9% confident” the de-banking was for political reasons.
Vice President Kamala Harris suggested she would sign federal abortion protections into law during a speech in Wisconsin on Thursday evening.

"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government shouldn't be telling her what to do with her body," Harris said, referring to women.

"When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law."

BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ DURING HARRIS CAMPAIGN EVENT AS VP PROMISES UNITY AT ELLIPSE RALLY

Harris has made abortion rights a cornerstone of her 2024 campaign, and has spoken on the issue frequently in her capacity as President Biden’s vice president.

Democrats are hoping that continued fallout from the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 will be a potent political cudgel in November. In the previous midterm races, it was partially credited with aiding them in keeping the Senate and blunting Republicans’ margin of victory in the House.

Harris said on Wednesday evening that Trump "would ban abortion nationwide" and likewise institute a ban on contraceptives – both stances the ex-president has explicitly denied.

While Democratic lawmakers have rallied around federal abortion legislation to codify it into law, Republicans have insisted it’s an issue best left up to the states.

Moderate GOP lawmakers facing tough re-election battles have emphasized that they would not support any federal abortion bans.

Abortion-related issues are on the ballot in several states in the November elections, including the battleground states of Nevada and Arizona. Democrats hope it will be a motivator for people who are normally apathetic to elections to turn out and vote blue.

"Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do," Harris said Wednesday.

The Republican National Committee (RNC) slammed Harris before her appearance in battleground Wisconsin, with Chairman Michael Whatley saying in a statement, "Harris’ vision for Wisconsin is an even more dangerously liberal version of the past four years. Kamala Harris broke Wisconsin’s economy, but President Trump will fix it."
An ongoing investigation of the Harris campaign’s astroturf machine has exposed her team actively recruiting foreign volunteers, according to a report by the Federalist.

The Federalist reports that a recent investigation has uncovered troubling practices within the Kamala Harris presidential campaign, raising questions about the involvement of foreign nationals in the 2024 election. The probe, conducted by the popular Twitter account @reddit_lies, alleges that the Harris campaign is actively recruiting foreign volunteers and providing them with guidance on how to circumvent campaign finance laws.

The investigation centers around a Discord server where Harris campaign employees coordinate with a vast network of volunteers to inundate social media platforms with pro-Harris content. The server, which boasts over 35,000 members, is also allegedly used to manipulate online discussions by artificially boosting pro-Harris posts and downvoting content critical of the campaign. Previous installments of the investigation focused on the astroturf machine’s manipulation of Reddit and the “community notes” feature on Elon Musk’s X/Twitter.

The latest installment focuses on the apparent involvement of foreign nationals in the campaign’s efforts. The investigation found multiple instances of non-U.S. citizens expressing their eagerness to volunteer for the Harris campaign, with some even discussing plans to travel to the United States to engage in door-to-door canvassing.

While the Federal Election Commission (FEC) permits foreign nationals to volunteer for U.S. political campaigns on an uncompensated basis, the Harris campaign’s actions appear to push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable. Moderators on the Discord server, who wield significant power within the community, were seen openly encouraging foreign volunteers and providing them with information on how to exploit legal loopholes to make financial contributions to American political causes.

In one example, the campaign urged foreign volunteers to participate in a phone banking effort aimed at reaching 5 million Wisconsin voters on Kamala Harris’s birthday. When a foreign user expressed concerns about “meddling in US elections,” a moderator quickly dismissed their worries, assuring them that their involvement was legal and encouraging them to participate.

The revelations have sparked outrage among those who believe that American elections should be decided by Americans alone. While the Harris campaign’s actions may not directly violate election laws, they raise serious ethical questions about the extent to which foreign influences should be allowed to shape the outcome of U.S. elections.

The investigation’s findings are particularly ironic given the Democratic Party’s long-standing accusations of foreign interference in the 2016 election and their repeated warnings about the threat posed by foreign actors to American democracy. The fact that a prominent Democratic campaign is now actively courting foreign volunteers is sure to raise eyebrows among voters across the political spectrum.

The 2024 presidential campaign is perhaps the closest race in modern history. The candidates are in the final stretch, receiving endless advice from the media and their champions who know the slightest bump will carry one or the other to victory.

I am going to give advice to both.

First, Vice President Kamala Harris. Media contributors like James Carville and Frank Luntz are hammering Harris to stop with the negative attacks on former President Donald Trump and instead go positive with her closing argument. This is what is done conventionally.

TRUMP VOWS TO CREATE COMPENSATION FUND FOR VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIME

But this time they’re wrong.

Focusing on a positive message will be difficult at best. Even with the legacy media pushing the Biden-Harris report card, domestically and internationally, that is fraught with failure. Any promises to continue those policies will backfire with undecideds. Her socialist vision is one America simply does not endorse.

Harris attacks relentlessly with deliberately false personal slurs – designed not just to hurt Trump but to destroy him politically. She claims a long list of falsehoods: he is a racist; he’s a fascist; he admires Hitler; he is a dictator; he will start a war; he organized riots; he is unhinged; he is unstable. Then the left-wing media repeat her comments over and over.

If I had Harris’s ethics, I would too. She knows that if she slurs him dishonestly, she will be outed by conservative-leaning media. So what? It’s the other media that matters. Harris knows she and her lies won’t be called out by any of them. It is an astonishing fact of life that throughout this campaign, first with Biden but more aggressively with her, there has been one provably false ad hominem slur after another that has never been fact-checked by the national media.

There’s yet another reason for continuing these personal attacks. Trump has a famously thin skin and can be baited. His responses, moreover, can be equally nasty – which she wants. If the media do cover the story, it will be presented as a she-said-he-said affair, and to feature a smooth but forceful soundbite from Harris, one, say, calling him unhinged. This will be followed by Trump’s selectively edited denial. When this happens, she is controlling the narrative, and she wins.

You doubt me? Go back and analyze their debate. It’s precisely what she did all night long. He bit the hook repeatedly and lashed back. She was controlling the narrative.

What should Trump do? Ignore her and do the exact opposite.

Critics say that Trump is completely undisciplined. This is not so. No undisciplined man builds a multi-billion-dollar business empire and then gets elected president of the United States. Trump is disciplined when he wants to be disciplined. He now needs to be disciplined.

He enjoys political boxing, especially against featherweights. But needs to accept that, while broadside attacks might arouse rally attendees, they are no longer his targeted audience. He needs to sell the undecideds. Rally rhetoric won’t make those old dogs hunt. But so, what?

Both candidates are still in rally mode. Trump held a huge event at Madison Square Garden in New York and the media embarrassed themselves complaining about it. Harris just made a speech from outside the White House. The media love her canned speeches.

Trump needs to understand he has another, equally powerful, weapon at his disposal, and that will bring skeptics to his camp. I think Trump has historically under-appreciated the tremendous power he has delivering a positive message.

My advice to Trump is that he analyze his State of the Union addresses. Every year his enemies in and out of the media expected him to be off script and pugnacious, and they were ready for bear. Instead, he threw them a change-up every time. He did the opposite.

He went positive, examining his record for the year completed, which always contained copious achievements, while laying out his agenda for the one to come which was commonly ambitious and attractive to a strong majority of Americans. He was the statesman, and after the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insultingly ripped his speech for the cameras, she was the angry failure.

Critics say that Trump is completely undisciplined. This is not so. No undisciplined man builds a multi-billion-dollar business empire and then gets elected president of the United States. Trump is disciplined when he wants to be disciplined. He now needs to be disciplined.

Go back and review his speech at Normandy. It was a masterpiece and projected him as the leader of the free world. Go back and review his speech at Warsaw. It was as powerful as anything ever delivered by President Ronald Reagan or British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, a full-throated defense of Western civilization, making hundreds of thousands of Poles roar their approval, and some weep.

Trump has something Harris doesn’t: a winning record, a winning agenda and a winning vision. She avoids her record because it’s not only radioactive politically, but socialism has a rich history of utter failure everywhere.

All Donald Trump needs to do is tell his story, remind people what was accomplished during his presidency. State simply he will do it again, both at home where so many are suffering, but also abroad where the world nears a boiling point. Lay out his vision of his city on the hill.

Make that his closing argument and Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States.
Just six days until Nov. 5 and the day after President Biden called Trump supporters "garbage," Former President Donald Trump addressed several thousand supporters in Green Bay, Wisconsin, while wearing a garbage worker's high visibility vest.

Trump explained that his decision to arrive at the rally in a dump truck, dressed in a garbage vest, was made spur of the moment. He joked that the vest made him look thinner and quipped that the vest could become part of his everyday attire.

"When they said I’d look thinner, I said in that case, I’ll wear it onstage," he joked. "I may never wear a blue jacket again."

He criticized Biden, Democrats, and most especially his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for "running a campaign of hate, vitriol and retribution."

TRUMP TRASHES BIDEN'S INSULT IN A GARBAGE TRUCK

"This week Kamala has been comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history and now speaking on a call for her campaign last night crooked Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters, he called them ‘garbage,'" he said.

Referencing Hillary Clinton’s 2016 comments calling his supporters "deplorables," he said that Biden’s remark "blows deplorables out of the water."

"My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans, it's true. You can’t be president if you hate the American people, which I believe they do, and Kamala Harris is not fit to be president of the United States," he said.

‘GARBAGE' TRUMP SUPPORTERS? AMERICANS REACT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ‘OUT OF TOUCH’ COMMENTS

Trump went on to emphasize himself as a unity candidate, uniting people of every race, creed and economic status.

"Kamala and Joe call all of us, and them, even them, ‘garbage.’ I call you the heart and soul of America. You are the heart and soul, you built our country, you built it," he said. "And by the way I want to thank all our sanitation workers all across America because they work hard, they really do work hard and they do an incredible job, and they don’t get the credit they deserve."

Trump also made fun of Harris for mentioning him 24 times in her closing argument speech on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. He accused the Harris campaign of paying and bussing in supporters for the speech.

He also thanked former astronaut Buzz Aldrin for his recent endorsement, saying: "What we have built is the biggest, broadest, most incredible coalition and the greatest political movement in the history of our country."

He urged Wisconsinites to vote, saying: "If we win Wisconsin we’re going to win the whole thing."

"Nov. 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America," he said.
CBS News anchor Norah O'Donnell said former President Trump is offering President Biden "no grace" over his remark disparaging Trump supporters after the GOP nominee showed up to a campaign event in a garbage truck on Wednesday.

"Former President Donald Trump was in North Carolina earlier, and tonight, he is also in Wisconsin. He landed in Green Bay just a short time ago and then pulled this campaign stunt, speaking to reporters from a garbage truck, proof that he and his supporters are giving no grace to a gaffe by President Biden where he, in his explanation, inadvertently called Trump supporters garbage," O'Donnell said in the opening segment of "CBS Evening News."

Biden sparked backlash Tuesday night after he appeared to call former President Trump's supporters "garbage" during a virtual Harris campaign call with Voto Latino. He took a swipe at former President Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made jokes mocking different ethnic groups, with one joke referring to Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage."

BIDEN'S ‘GARBAGE’ SHOT AT TRUMP SUPPORTERS DOWNPLAYED, DISMISSED, SPUN BY MEDIA: ‘COMES DOWN TO AN APOSTROPHE’

"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters," Biden said on the call. "His- his- his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it is un-American."

As Democrats in the media rushed to defend, dismiss or downplay the comment, Republicans have embraced it as the new line of attack against the Harris campaign with less than a week to the hotly contested election.

On Wednesday, Trump rolled up to the battleground state of Wisconsin in a garbage truck to answer questions from reporters, wearing an orange reflective vest with "Trump Make America Great Again 2024" emblazoned on the vehicle.

"How do you like my garbage truck?" he asked reporters. "This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden."

PA GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM BIDEN'S ‘GARBAGE’ COMMENT: ‘I’D NEVER INSULT' TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Biden's "garbage" comment quickly went viral and sparked swift condemnation from critics, but many journalists and news organizations rushed to clean up his mess. The White House, in a transcript of the speech, added an apostrophe to Biden’s remarks, making it appear that he said, "The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American." Biden himself claimed that he was referring specifically to the comedian at a Trump rally whose shot at Puerto Rico went viral over the weekend.

The Trump campaign quickly distanced itself from the joke after it was made. Trump told "Hannity" that he doesn't know the comedian and that his joke was not vetted by the campaign ahead of time.

Still, Democrats and media pundits have pounced on the soundbite, using it to pummel the Trump campaign for the "racist comment" and encourage Puerto Rican voters to support Harris.

On her show Monday, O'Donnell described the comment as "vile" before telling viewers, "Puerto Rico is an American island. Let me say that again. Puerto Ricans are American citizens…" She also showed interviews from Puerto Rican voters who said they believed the joke reflected how Trump felt about them.

Biden said he wanted to take Hinchcliffe 'for a swim' when asked about the comic’s controversial remarks earlier this week, but did not elaborate about what he meant.
Former President Trump reiterated his plans to "make America great again" as the 2024 race enters its final days.

Trump sat down with Fox News host Sean Hannity at Mar-a-Lago and repeated the same campaign promises he’s made on the trail, vowing to secure the border, fix the economy and immigration system and utilize tariffs against foreign countries.

The 2024 GOP presidential nominee said a potential second administration of his would be different because, now, he knows "everybody in Washington."

TULSI GABBARD SAYS SHE WOULD BE ‘HONORED’ TO JOIN A POTENTIAL TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

"I didn't know anybody [during his first term]. I was not a Washington person. I was rarely there," Trump said Wednesday on "Hannity." "I know everybody [now]. I know the good, the strong, the weak, the stupid. I know the -- I know everybody. And we're going to make this country great again, and we have to save our country."

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: IN NATION'S BIGGEST BATTLEGROUND, NEW POLLS SHOW ‘IT’S REALLY, REALLY CLOSE'

He rallied against the Biden-Harris administration for its handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, record border crossings and weak foreign policy, pointing to Russia’s war against Ukraine and Israel’s war against Hamas, once again claiming they both would never have started had he been in the White House.

"We're going to be respected again. We're going to make America great again. And there's nothing in the world I'd rather be doing. I don't want to be on some beautiful beach. I don't want to be sitting in some faraway hotel where it's very nice and watching television or doing something. I want to be doing what I'm doing," Trump said. "It's so incredible."

The former president headed to his Green Bay, Wis., rally Wednesday in a garbage truck after President Biden called Trump supporters "garbage."

The White House denied Biden was referring to Trump’s supporters and instead attempted to place blame on comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico over the weekend as a "floating island of garbage" at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.

"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage – which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation," read a tweet Tuesday evening from Biden’s X , formerly Twitter, account.

Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters Wednesday on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews that she "strongly" disagrees with "any criticism of people based on who they vote for."

"You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career," she said referencing her closing campaign argument at the Ellipse. "I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not."
While Democrats are leaning on celebrity star power as the 2024 presidential election enters the final stretch, former President Trump has also accrued support from a contingent of stars.

Here are nine celebrities who are backing Trump in the 2024 election:

Jason Aldean

The country music star has been vocal in support of Trump for several years.

JASON ALDEAN, BRITTANY ALDEAN IN FAMILY BOX WITH TRUMP AT REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION

In July, Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany Aldean, were spotted at the Republican National Convention in the Trump family box.

After the first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Aldean posted to Instagram to show his support and well-wishes for "45."

"This is what a Warrior looks like!," Aldean wrote in his caption attached to a photograph of Trump with blood on his face and a stiff arm raised to the crowd of campaign rally attendees. "@realdonaldtrump we are thinking about u and praying for you and your family. God has a bigger plan for you, my friend, and I think we all know what that is by now."

Kid Rock

The singer, who has been friends with Trump for years, has been vocal about his support for the former president in all his presidential runs.

He performed on the final night of the Republican National Convention in July, just ahead of Trump's speech.

"They act as if a vote for Donald Trump is almost like you’re directly voting for Armageddon, like you see hysterical performances outside of courtrooms, endless MSNBC bombast," Brand said. "But I’m starting to think that no, a greater threat to democracy is this kind of technological feudalism, that tells you that it cares about you and that it’s protecting vulnerable people, all the while increasing censorship, increasing the funding of wars, increasing the division between ordinary Americans."

The liberal late-night hosts either downplayed or completely avoided President Biden's controversial "garbage" remark about Trump supporters after panning the controversial Puerto Rico joke that made news from former President Trump's Madison Square Garden rally.

On Monday, "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert hyped the "massive repercussions" of the joke made by insult comedian Tony Hinchliffe referring to Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage," pointing to the "470,000" Puerto Rican voters living in Pennsylvania.

"And you're not going to win over half a million people by insulting their homeland," Colbert exclaimed.

On Tuesday night, Colbert boasted about the fallout from the joke by reading several negative headlines affecting the Trump campaign.

BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS 'GARBAGE' DURING HARRIS CAMPAIGN EVENT AS VP PROMISES UNITY AT ELLIPSE RALLY

"Here's a little pro-tip: when running for president, try not to October surprise yourself," Colbert quipped. "It's rare to tell a joke so bad it alters the course of human history."

Colbert went on to knock Trump for not taking any responsibility for Hinchcliffe's joke.

However, the subject of "garbage" was ignored in Colbert's monologue on Wednesday, which instead drew focus to Vice President Kamala Harris' crowd size at her Ellipse rally, touting how it outnumbered Trump's audience when he gave his Jan. 6 speech at the same location.

ABC's Jimmy Kimmel blasted the Madison Square Garden rally as "mean," "hateful" and "racist," telling his audience it "pissed off Puerto Ricans to the point that Bad Bunny had to get involved."

"Trump made such a mess with Puerto Ricans, they're now throwing paper towels at him," Kimmel joked Monday night.

BIDEN'S ‘GARBAGE’ SHOT AT TRUMP SUPPORTERS DOWNPLAYED, DISMISSED, SPUN BY MEDIA: ‘COME DOWN TO AN APOSTROPHE’

But on Wednesday night, instead of taking aim at Biden, he ridiculed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who he said "frantically" informed Trump about Biden's "garbage" comment at Tuesday's rally in Allentown, Penn.

"Oh my stars! What kind of language is that to use?!" Kimmel dramatically reacted after playing the clip of Rubio and referencing the "Despicable Me" movie series. "He’s like an excited little minion bringing big news to Gru."

The "Jimmy Kimmel Live" host went on to say he didn't blame the Trump campaign for "jump[ing] all over this garbage thing," conceding it was "not a smart thing to say."

"Joe Biden should drop out of this race immediately," Kimmel joked before moving on to mock Trump's garbage truck campaign stunt.

Notably, both Colbert and Kimmel emceed mega fundraisers for Biden before he exited the 2024 race.

CNN ANCHOR SKEPTICAL OF WHITE HOUSE CLEANUP OF BIDEN'S ‘GARBAGE’ COMMENT: ‘YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT FOR YOURSELF’

Meanwhile, "Late Night" host Seth Meyers, after pummeling Trump on Monday over the Puerto Rico blunder, took a brief swipe at Biden Wednesday night but spent more time panning Trump's attempts to distance himself from the joke.

"While denouncing racist remarks at former President Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, President Biden appeared to refer to Trump supporters as 'garbage.' Now, obviously, what he meant to say was nothing," Meyers said as he jokingly got tense. "Why are you saying anything?! Did you forget that you're so bad at saying things, we had to go get somebody else?!"

Meyers also joked about the transcript of Biden's comments released by the White House, saying "we all have to decipher it like we're reading backwards hieroglyphics through a jeweler's loupe."

Biden attempted to clarify his comments, which were made on a virtual Harris campaign call with Voto Latino.

"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it," Biden wrote on X. "His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation."
In the previous installments of this investigation into how the Harris-Walz presidential campaign is dishonestly manipulating online platforms, I noted the existence of a Discord server where campaign employees coordinate with a volunteer army to flood social media sites with campaign propaganda. The volunteers also vote en masse on social media to artificially boost Harris-Walz content or downvote content that is harmful to their campaign. Not only is this deceptive and misleading to voters, it’s a clear violation of these websites’ Terms of Service.

In part one and part two of the investigation, I noted this strategy had been successful at manipulating both Reddit and X. Over the past month, one out of every eight of the top stories in the eight-million-member Politics subreddit was planted by the campaign. On X, the campaign appears to have successfully voted down Community Notes accurately calling out the Harris campaign for tweeting out brazen lies.

But one activity I found on the Discord server was particularly concerning. After years of Democrats erroneously insisting that Donald Trump had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election and otherwise warning of foreign election manipulation, the Harris-Walz campaign is actively recruiting foreigners to work on the campaign and is even encouraging them to donate to American political causes.

There appears to be no vetting, and given that the Harris-Walz campaign’s Discord community overtly engaged in disinformation campaigns, it was ripe for infiltration and abuse by foreign intelligence and other bad actors attempting to influence the election — although I saw no concrete proof of that.

However, my research found multiple foreign nationals actively volunteering for the Harris-Walz campaign. This activity, while permitted by the FEC, raises questions about whether foreigners should be allowed to volunteer for official U.S. political campaigns. Their comments ranged from showing excitement at how they could volunteer to “save democracy”…

… to Canadians sharing their plans to make road trips to Michigan, where they aim to go door-to-door canvassing …

…and asking how they, as foreigners, could donate money to “help fund the Harris-Walz campaign” using a legal donation loophole …

… which was praised by the server’s moderators, who went on to distribute the link to other channels (chats) in the Discord server.

The server’s moderators embraced the foreigners with open arms. Moderators are powerful users in Discord communities — they have the power to delete messages, ban users, and make announcements that reach the entire server’s user base (35,000 individual people at the time of writing). They were overjoyed to see non-American support, and eager to help foreigners learn how they could make a meaningful impact in the upcoming presidential election.

On Oct. 20, 2024, the campaign pinged the abroad group, desperately urging foreigners to spam call Wisconsin voters. Their goal was to reach 5 million telemarketing calls on Kamala’s birthday.

When one foreign user expressed concern about “meddling in US elections,” a moderator quickly assured him this was perfectly legal, and urged him to phone bank for Kamala.

While the Federal Election Commission does prohibit foreign nationals from making monetary donations and contributions to U.S. campaigns directly, it does explicitly allow foreign nationals to volunteer for campaigns as long as they are uncompensated. Unfortunately, the FEC does not account for donation loopholes, which are currently being propagated throughout the Harris-Walz Discord server.

The Harris-Walz staff are clearly teaching foreigners how to skirt FEC regulations. This may not be illegal, but it is enticing foreign nationals to influence American elections — something that Democrats have spent years warning is a serious threat to democracy.

Whether this directly violates election laws is also beside the point for many Americans, who believe foreign nationals should not be allowed to volunteer for U.S. presidential campaigns. American elections should be for Americans, and the Harris-Walz campaign is actively inviting foreign influences into their campaign.
Poor Vice President Kamala Harris just wants to win the presidential election, but unfortunately, her commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden, is too busy working to get her opponent elected. At least, that’s what it seems like.

Republicans woke up Wednesday morning thinking, “Hey, that Joe Biden character ain’t half bad!”

On Tuesday night, while Harris was set to give her closing arguments for the 2024 election, she was upstaged by Biden, who simultaneously held a virtual meeting with the organization Voto Latino. During the call, Biden called Trump voters “garbage,” sparking a wildfire of backlash. It wasn’t only conservatives who were angry; Democrat Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also denounced the rhetoric live on CNN. While the White House has attempted to clean up Biden’s statements with claims of a missing apostrophe, the damage has been done.

Instead of the Democrat lackeys in corporate media being able to fawn all over Harris’ speech, they are left cleaning up Biden’s mess. The late-night shows and media events over the next week should have been about Harris, but Biden stripped that from her. Republicans will do their best to keep this in the news as long as possible to keep the Harris campaign on defense. (ROOKE: Harris Campaign’s 11th Hour Looks Like A Nightmare)

Biden apparently wants to be a bigger part of Harris’ campaign, but her team is blowing him off, according to Axios. “Harris’ campaign keeps responding: ‘We’ll get back to you,'” three people familiar with the situation told the outlet.

Biden didn’t take the Harris shove-off lying down. He decided to do his own thing, like schedule the get-out-the-vote event he attended Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The move to create his own campaign schedule might explain how he ended up calling Trump supporters “garbage” while Harris was giving her closing address in his backyard. This isn’t the first time Biden stole the limelight from the Harris campaign, however.

On Oct. 4, Biden entered the White House briefing room for the first time during his presidency, forcing all corporate media to turn their attention and live broadcasts to Washington, D.C. His impromptu press conference came at the worst time for the Harris campaign. (ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)

It just so happened that when Biden walked into the room, Harris was set to speak at an event in Michigan, promoting the end of the longshoreman strike to Michigan union workers. What would have been a slam dunk for the Harris campaign became a nothing burger. Hardly anyone in America knew she was there or connected her with ending the strike.

“We were about to actually go live with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan. And apparently, she is talking about this port strike ending,” CNN host Boris Sanchez lamented on air. “She’s trying to appeal to union workers, and yet you have the President of the United States come out, clearly overshadowing her answering significant questions. Is that a communications mistake? Is the left hand not talking to the right hand in this situation?”

It happened again a few days later when Harris was scheduled to appear live on The View. As Harris sat down with the host, Biden held another press conference. Commentary Magazine editor and New York Post columnist John Podhoretz mused that it’s almost like Biden might be mad at her for taking his spot in the presidential race.

“What is going on between Biden and Harris? He has a press conference at the same moment she’s on The View. Her campaign is complaining about DeSantis and he’s praising DeSantis,” Podhoretz said. “Why, it’s almost like she staged a coup against him and he is working against her from the sidelines!”

But don’t worry. While it may seem like Biden is secretly working for the Trump campaign to ruin all of Harris’ speaking events and make Democrats look unhinged, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wants everyone to know Biden and Harris are great friends who talk all the time and coordinate on everything campaign-related. (ROOKE: Epstein World Goes All In For Kamala Harris)

‘We are in close touch with the campaign to determine when, where and how the president can be helpful,” Bates told Axios.

Maybe Bates should have a little talk with the Harris campaign because, according to Axios’ sources, her team finds Biden to be a “political liability” and wants nothing to do with him.

Whether it’s an honest mistake or public displays of animosity, Trump is the only winner in this Democrat breakup. As CNN said Tuesday night, Biden “may have done some pretty significant harm” to the Harris campaign. If Trump wins, he should thank Biden for running cover for his campaign during October.
Buzz Aldrin, former astronaut and the second person to walk on the moon, endorsed former President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, according to a post shared to X on Wednesday.

Aldrin praised the Trump administration’s approach to space exploration, including instituting the Space Force, and highlighted the importance of the government focusing on space in his endorsement, according to the post. The former astronaut also said that he believes “we are best served” by voting for Trump, according to the post.

“Over time, I have seen our government’s approach to space wax and wane,” Aldrin wrote. “But under the first Trump Administration, I was impressed to see how human space exploration was elevated as a policy of high importance again. Under President Trump’s first term, America saw a revitalized interest in Space, and his Administration reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars.”

“America is facing serious and difficult challenges both at home and abroad,” Aldrin wrote later in the social media post. “The Presidency requires clarity in judgement, decisiveness, and calm under pressure that few have a natural ability to manage, or the life experience to successfully undertake. It is a job where decisions are made that routinely involve American lives – some urgently but not without thought.”

“In this election, we have a choice and we all have one vote,” Aldrin wrote. “For some, the choice may not be easy – but in times of uncertainty real leaders are most needed – to guide and inspire a people, to push through the noise, recognize what really matters, and accomplish missions critical to all citizens.” (RELATED: ‘Americans Don’t Trust The News Media’: Bezos Speaks Out After WaPo Chose Not To Endorse Harris)

Alrdin’s announcement endorsing Trump came with just six days left until election night. Both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, have received various high-profile endorsements throughout the presidential race.

The endorsement comes after Mayor Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, Michigan, endorsed Trump in September. The former president has received support from steelworkers in the key swing state of Pennsylvania and was also recently endorsed by hundreds of former national security officials.

Billionaire and SpaceX founder Elon Musk endorsed Trump in July, and has since appeared at various campaign events for the GOP presidential candidate. Trump announced in September that if he is reelected in November, Musk would serve as the head of a Government Efficiency Commission.

The Washington Post recently came under fire for its decision to not endorse a candidate for president, prompting thousands of readers to cancel subscriptions to the newspaper. The Los Angeles Times also announced that they would not be endorsing either presidential candidate, prompting departures from several pro-Harris employees at both papers.

Aldrin was one of three astronauts who went to the moon on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, and was the first astronaut with a doctoral degree, according to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s website. Aldrin previously announced his marriage to Dr. Anca Faur on his 93rd birthday in January 2023.

Far-left former soccer star Megan Rapinoe is predicting a “grim” and “violent reality” if Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

Appearing on the A Touch More podcast on Wednesday, Rapinoe and Sue Bird railed about the 2024 election, especially women’s “reproductive rights,” according to Fox News.

Unsurprisingly, the two left-wing athletes proudly touted their support for Kamala Harris, with Rapinoe saying, “We have a really amazing opportunity to elect a Black woman in this country. And for me, that is really important.”

Rapinoe went on to accuse Trump of planning a “violent reality” for America.

“It is stressful. I am nervous, but I also am hopeful,” the leftist athlete exclaimed. “I believe in people, and I certainly believe in women, and I believe that people want better than the grim, dark, just violent reality that Donald Trump has very clearly laid out for us. He’s telling everybody what he’s gonna do, and it’s really dark, and it’s really sad, and I don’t think anybody wants to live like that.”

Rapinoe also said she agrees with extremist, left-wing San Antonio Spurs coach Greg Popovich, who recently attacked Trump for the thousandth time, calling Trump “pathetic.”

“I actually really liked what Greg Popovich had to say about Donald Trump. He goes on to basically say you wouldn’t want this guy babysitting your child or working in your small business. He’s small, he’s mean, he makes fun of people,” Repinoe said.

The ex-soccer star then went on to rant about the “racist” rally Trump held at New York City’s Madison Square Garden.

“There was a rally at Madison Square Garden where the comedic act, the opening act, [was] just openly racist, openly bigoted, openly xenophobic – saying the most horrible things. You would never allow your kids to say those kinds of things… There’s a level of decency here that I think is being lost in the decisiveness of right, left, and this, that, and the other. I think that’s important,” Rapinoe exclaimed.

Facebook executives planned to censor the New York Post’s report on Hunter Biden’s laptop to gain favor with what they expected to be an incoming Biden-Harris administration, a House Judiciary report revealed.

The FBI first tipped off Big Tech prior to The Post’s reports in Oct. 2020 that Russian agents were “preparing a strikingly similar document dump,” The Post first reported, citing the House document. The new congressional investigation by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government showed screenshots of communications from Facebook and Microsoft.

One unnamed Microsoft employee wrote on Oct. 14, 2020 (the day The Post published the first expose on Hunter Biden’s foreign ties) that the “FBI tipped us all off last week that this Burisma story was likely to emerge,” according to the report.

“Obviously, our calls on this [New York Post story] could colour the way an incoming Biden administration views us more than almost anything else,” a WhatsApp message from Facebook’s then-Vice President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, stated that same day, the report said. Clegg is currently President of Global Affairs for Meta, according to his LinkedIn page.

Internal communications from Facebook demonstrated how employees dismissed the outlet’s reporting because the content was “expected for hack and leak,” according to the report.

“Right on schedule,” another Facebook employee agreed, the investigation found.

HOW THE FBI “PREBUNKED” A TRUE STORY ABOUT THE BIDEN FAMILY’S CORRUPTION BEFORE THE 2020 ELECTION The FBI knew Hunter Biden’s laptop was real & worked for MONTHS to prime Big Tech to censor the @nypost story.

“[Facebook employee] is not in touch with the FBI on this. I’ll connect with Maryland and [Facebook employee] will raise at the [FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force] meeting today,” another employee wrote, the report read.

Some documents included in the report implied that “key employees” within the companies knew their censorship would influence the 2020 election.

“But, when we get halted up to the hill to testify on why we influenced the 2020 elections we can say we have been meeting for YEARS with USG [the U.S. Government] to plan for it,” a screenshot of a July 15, 2020 internal Facebook message showed.

The report asserts that the FBI met with tech companies at least 30 times during 2020 to discuss a possible “hack and leak.”

“Even after meeting with the FBI, social media platforms—particularly Facebook— doubled down on their decision to censor the New York Post story about Biden family influence peddling,” the report said. (RELATED: Missouri Launches Investigation Into Google For Allegedly Censoring Right-Wing Speech)

The Caller reached out to Meta and but has not heard back at the time of publication. The FBI declined to comment.

Not all Facebook employees agreed with the decision to censor the content, according to the report’s findings. Joel Kaplan, then the company’s Vice President of Global Policy, was skeptical, according to a screenshot. “Years of stories about the adult family members of Presidents would suggest that that content is newsworthy,” the screenshot read.

Five days after the Post’s story was published, 51 former officials in the intelligence community falsely labeled the story “Russian disinformation.”

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 30, 2024

“This was just the beginning of Big Tech’s censorship at the Biden-Harris Administration’s behest,” Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said in a post online. “A few months later, Facebook, YouTube, and Amazon began caving to the Biden-Harris White House’s pressure to censor American speech, including true information and jokes.”

The Daily Caller News Foundation first confirmed in October 2020 that The Post’s story on Hunter Biden’s laptop was authentic. The DCNF verified that an email sent to Hunter Biden from an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors detailing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2015 was credible.
More than 200 retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials signed onto an open letter endorsing former President Donald Trump, arguing he’s the only candidate who will enforce border security.

The Biden-Harris administration enacted policies that “systematically dismantled” a border enforcement apparatus that prevented crime at the U.S.-Mexico border and across the country, according to numerous retired Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other DHS officials who have spent a career in the field. Signatories to the letter included retired Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott and former ICE chief Tom Homan, among many others. (RELATED: ‘Something Has To Be Done’: Trump Pledges Compensation Fund For Victims Of Migrant Crime)

These border enforcement professionals laid out their case as to why they believe the border crisis got so incredibly bad during the current administration, and how things were different in the previous administration.

“President Trump respected the experience of career border security professionals and listened to our advice,” the letter stated. “When border security experts explained to President Trump how illegal immigration empowers the cartels to control who and what enters our home, he listened and acted.”

“The Trump administration supported policies and programs that reduced illegal immigration, instilled integrity into our legal immigration system and ensured that the U.S. government was doing all we could to control who and what entered our homeland. The borders of the U.S. were never more secure than they were during the Trump administration,” the letter continues.

Upon entering office, the Biden-Harris administration undertook 296 executive actions on immigration, with 89 of those orders specifically reversing or beginning the process of undoing Trump’s immigration policies. The administration went on to undo a number of major Trump initiatives concerning border security, such as ending border wall construction and shutting down the Remain in Mexico program.

What followed was a historic flow of illegal immigration through the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023, according to data tracked by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Scott, who led Border Patrol from February 2020 to August 2021, previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the Biden administration tightly cracked down on him and his colleagues from speaking out about the border crisis.

Since taking over the re-election mantle from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has attempted to rebrand herself as more of a border hawk, with her campaign boasting ads that feature the border wall and a pledge to hire more Border Patrol agents if she wins in November.

Trump’s support from border security professionals isn’t limited to those who have since retired from service. Earlier in October, the Border Patrol union formally endorsed the Republican candidate, with the president of the National Border Patrol Council saying that a victory for Harris would mean “every city, every community in this great country, is going to go to hell.”

The letter brought forward by the retired border professionals echoed similar sentiments.

[U]nder VP Harris’ watch, idealist political appointees with zero border security experience were empowered to implement disastrous and deadly border security policy for the United States,” the letter states. “The devastating results have handed complete control of our border to the cartels, provided them with astronomical record profits, ballooned legal immigration backlogs, and have left millions of illegal aliens in the country.”

“Assuming you care about border security as much as we do, the choice is clear. President Trump is the only candidate that we can trust to secure our nation’s borders,” the letter concluded.

Neither the Trump campaign nor the Harris campaign immediately responded to a request for comment from the DCNF.

Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a long list of old lies in her “closing argument” speech in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, defying fact-checkers and repeating false claims that had already been debunked during the campaign.

Here are the most egregious of Harris’s false claims:

1. Then-President Donald Trump “sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people.” Trump did not send a “mob”; he told his supporters to march “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol. Rioters were already there — but they were not “armed” with guns. Only five rioters were ultimately charged with firearms crimes — but they did not use their guns during the riot. Few were “armed” with anything. And many of the protesters believed they were protecting an election, not overturning one, according to a Harvard study.

2. “He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute.” No such list exists, and Trump has pointed out that despite campaign rhetoric in 2016, he refrained from prosecuting his rival, Hillary Clinton, even though she had arguably broken the law with her misuse of classified information and destruction of government documents.

3. “He says that one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6.” Trump has never said that he would pardon violent people, or extremists. He has said that he would pardon “many” of the rioters, on a case by case basis, implying that he would pardon non-violent offenders. Notably, Harris herself urged people to bail out rioters arrested during the 2020 riots.

4. “Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him.” Trump has never said anything like that. What he said was that he would use “the National Guard, or if really necessary … the military” against “radical left lunatics” who tried to disrupt the election. This is actually a common position among both parties: Democrats deployed the military to protect the Capitol after the riot.

5. “I will always tell you the truth.” That is never a good thing for a politician to say, and it is easily disproven. Harris lied to the country about President Joe Biden’s mental state; she also lied about the Charlottesville “very fine people” hoax in the 2024 presidential debate, after being fact-checked about the same claim on live television in the 2020 vice presidential debate. And, of course, she lied in this speech — in the many examples above, and below.

6. Trump wants “tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.” As Breitbart News has demonstrated in many repeated fact checks, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 primarily benefited the middle class, and actually imposed higher taxes on some wealthy households, especially in Democrat-run states. Trump did lower corporate taxes, but with the intent of encouraging companies to invest more at home than abroad, and to create jobs for Americans.

7. “He will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax.” Trump has never proposed a “national sales tax” and would certainly oppose one. The term “national sales tax” is how Democrats describe Trump’s tariffs, which could — in theory — raise some prices. But Democrats aren’t opposed to tariffs; the Biden-Harris administration kept the Trump tariffs in place. And those tariffs did not raise prices significantly; inflation kicked in when Biden took office.

8. “He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year.” This is a claim Breitbart News has fact-checked before — and so has NBC News, which said it “has merit, but it omits some key context.” His budget proposed some Social Security cuts but not Medicare benefit cuts. Ironically, as Breitbart noted, “the Biden-Harris administration has cut Medicare Advantage, which a majority of Medicare beneficiaries use over traditional Medicare.”

9. “He would ban abortion nationwide.” Trump has rejected this idea at every opportunity, saying that he believes the issue is best handled by the states, which can choose whatever policy they want. That was the effect of overturning Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision. Some liberal states granted abortion until birth. Some conservative states banned it in most circumstances, but in no instance were these “Trump abortion bans,” as Harris claimed.

10. Trump would “restrict access to birth control and to IVF.” Again, that is simply false. In fact, Trump has said that he would make government or private insurance policies pay for IVF, which is the opposite of restricting access. When Alabama’s highest court made a decision that resulted in many IVF providers refusing to provide the service, it was Trump who urged the state’s Republican legislature to convene to legalize IVF for hopeful parents.

11. Trump “killed” a border security bill. This is another tired Biden-Harris talking point. The administration was well aware that it does not need a new law to enforce border security, but tried to blame Congress for not passing “comprehensive immigration reform.” When one Republican worked with Democrats on a “bipartisan” bill that would have legalized migration at current levels, the rest balked. They did not need Trump to tell them to oppose the idea.

12. Trump called soldiers “suckers and losers.” This is an old hoax, cooked up by the left-wing Atlantic and refuted by many, many witnesses, including those (like former National Security Advisor John Bolton) who had broken with Trump politically. Ironically, again, it was Biden and Harris who failed to contact the families of the 13 Americans killed in the Afghanistan pullout, and Harris never apologized for smearing Border Patrol agents as racist.

13. Trump “wants to put [people who disagree with him] in jail.” Ambulance sirens were heard at times during Harris’s speech, and they may well have been “irony alerts,” because it is the Biden-Harris Department of Justice that is still trying to put Trump in jail. Harris also spoke on the same day former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon emerged from prison after serving four months for a contempt of Congress charge widely viewed as bogus.

Harris went on to describe Trump as a “wannabe dictator” and “petty tyrant” in a speech that was as negative as any she has made in the campaign. Her “closing argument” was little more than a partisan attack — and a dishonest one.

Far-left president of Colombia Gustavo Petro claimed on Tuesday that the United States is engaging in “ethnic discrimination” of illegal migrants and accused it of being responsible for the Venezuelan migrant crisis by imposing human rights sanctions on the socialist regime.

Petro described the sanctions as a “blockade” on the country.

The socialist president made his remarks in a speech at the United Nations’ ongoing meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP16), hosted throughout this week in the Colombian city of Cali.

Since the early 2010s, Venezuela is experiencing an unprecedented migrant crisis in the region described as the worst in the Western Hemisphere, rivaled only in size to that of Syria and Ukraine. Those countries are in a state of war, unlike Venezuela, whose migrant crisis is the direct result of the collapse of the country’s socialist system under the authoritarian regime led by dictator Nicolás Maduro.

According to U.N. estimates, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled their country — roughly 27.5 percent of the country’s 28 million population.

Petro, a former member of the Marxist M19 guerrilla with friendly ties with Maduro, did not attribute any responsibility to the dictator or his socialist regime for the Venezuelan migrant crisis in his speech. Instead, he claimed that the crisis is the result of an alleged U.S. “blockade” which, according to him, backfired, leading to a surge of U.S.-bound Venezuelan migrants.

“The Swedes are scared of the Syrian migration and there are 200,000 of them. Three million Venezuelans passed through here and we are not scared, because we consider them our brothers,” Petro said. “And they continued south and now they are going north, to the United States, which was the one that devised to blockade Venezuela. Victim of their own invention.”

The Colombian far-left president continued his accusations against the United States by claiming that it engages in “ethnic discrimination” of migrants akin to that of the times of slavery. According to Petro, migrants only serve the United States when they work 18 hours, but not “when they talk about rights.”

“The blockade is not a boomerang that is thrown against a people to kill them and returns to the people of the one who threw it. Then they become fascists because they do not want those migrants, neither Haitians, nor Cubans, nor Venezuelans, nor Colombians, nor Latin Americans in the United States,” Petro said. “They are only good at working 18 hours of forced labor, but when they talk about rights they are no good and should be expelled.”

The “blockade” that, according to Petro, Washington allegedly maintains against Venezuela, refers to sanctions imposed by the United States — under the administration of former President Donald Trump — on the Venezuelan socialist regime in response to an extensive list of human rights violations committed by the regime against its own people. According to Petro, it is the U.S. sanctions, and not the Maduro regime, that have pushed a “part of the society literally starving in a land that is one of the richest in the world.”

In reality, the Venezuelan migrant crisis started several years before the United States imposed sanctions on Maduro, members of his top brass, and specific Venezuelan state-owned companies such as PDVSA, Venezuela’s flagship oil company. PDVSA was sanctioned in January 2019, years after the country’s collapse.

By 2014, Venezuela’s socialist economy was already experiencing a severe collapse, with widespread shortages of even the most basic goods and out-of-control inflation that pulverized the value of the local currency, the Venezuelan bolivar.

Maduro responded to the widespread shortages — all caused by socialist policies such as steep price controls — by implementing a strict weekly ration system managed through fingerprint scanners and other draconian forms of control. The collapse of socialism led to a dramatic 2,889 percent increase of Venezuelan migration between 2012 and 2015.

Maduro also deployed the Bolivarian National Guard to “watch over” the lengthy lines people had to stand in to get their rationed goods — with widespread cases of abuse committed by the military officials.

Much like Petro’s recent claims, the socialist Maduro regime — which has openly denied the existence of a migrant crisis and even mocked it in the past — repeatedly describes the U.S. sanctions as the cause of the country’s unprecedented exodus, abstaining from taking any responsibility for the disastrous socialist policies that caused the nation’s migrant crisis in the first place.

The Biden-Harris administration temporarily lifted sanctions on PDVSA and other state-owned companies between October 2023 and April 2024 in a failed effort to entice Maduro to allow a “free and fair” presidential election.

Maduro, upon receiving the generous U.S. sanctions relief package, instead increased his brutal repression throughout the sanctions relief period, held a highly fraudulent election on July 28, and proclaimed himself the “winner” without showing any voter data to substantiate his claims. Maduro unleashed a unprecedentedly brutal crackdown campaign against dissidents that left 27 dead and more than 2,400 detained — including dozens of minors who have been victim of torture.

Congressional leaders in both the House and Senate revealed what they have in store for border enforcement and immigration reform if former President Donald Trump reenters the White House.

Beefing up border security and cracking down on interior enforcement are all on the table if Trump is reelected in November, according to several GOP lawmakers who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation. Sen Ted Cruz and Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, along with Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, have zeroed in on the issue in Congress and say they are ready and waiting to assist the incoming Trump administration. (RELATED: NYPD Refused Detainer Request And Released Illegal Migrant Charged With Attempted Murder, ICE Says)

“Every day we hear about illegal aliens assaulting or murdering another American,” Cruz said to the DCNF. “I’ve been fighting for justice for Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old from Houston who was brutally murdered by two illegal aliens released into Texas under the administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”

“Next Congress I look forward to passing and to having President Trump sign into law my Justice for Jocelyn Act,” Cruz continued. “This legislation is aimed at ensuring that no child and no family ever again experiences what happened to Jocelyn.”

Nungaray was a 12-year-old Houston girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered in June by two Venezuelan men. Federal immigration authorities say the two men entered the United States unlawfully before their arrest for Nungaray’s brutal killing.

The Justice for Jocelyn Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to “exhaust all reasonable efforts” to keep an illegal migrant in custody before resorting to releasing them into the interior of the country, according to the legislation. Should an illegal migrant be released, however, the bill would call for continuous GPS monitoring until their removal from the country or the completion of their immigration proceedings.

The legislation also would empower federal immigration officials to immediately deport illegal migrants who violate their terms of their release — a proposal that could potentially prevent an incredible number of crimes by illegal migrants who repeatedly encounter law enforcement.

“Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have released dangerous illegal aliens into our country that have gone on to take the lives of American citizens,” Nehls stated to the DCNF. “I have introduced pieces of legislation that would remove illegal aliens who fail to comply with their release order and to improve the mandatory tracking and detention of illegal aliens for the entire process.”

“Too many Americans have lost their lives at the hands of illegal aliens that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden let into our country,” Nehls continued. “Congress must do everything to ensure that Americans are put first, not illegal aliens who shouldn’t even be here in the first place.”

Nehls, whose district largely covers the Houston suburbs, is a sponsor for the Justice for Jocelyn Act on the House side. Like Cruz, the Republican congressman has also ripped the Biden-Harris administration for the release of illegal migrants when there has been detention space available within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.

“In a second Trump administration, the House Committee on Homeland Security will do everything possible to help the United States return to an era of secure borders and robust interior enforcement,” Green, who serves as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, stated to the DCNF. “Ending the Biden-Harris border crisis will require two things — policy changes to end the flow of inadmissible aliens into our country, and more funding for interior enforcement to demonstrate that there are consequences to entering illegally.”

With Green as its chairman, the House Homeland Committee has remained one of the Biden-Harris administration’s fiercest critics, demanding answers on a slate of immigration-related controversies, such as the vetting process that went into the entry of an Afghan recently arrested for allegedly plotting an Election Day terrorist attack, the alleged failure of the administration to properly vet foreign nationals before they boarded domestic flights, the handling of unaccompanied alien children into the country, among numerous other border issues.

“While we don’t control the budget process, I believe that providing massive increases for ICE detention and removal operations will be paramount, and I will be vocal about their necessity,” Green continued.

All three lawmakers have also been presented with the 2024 Congressional Champions of Interior Enforcement award by the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE) for their legislative efforts. NICE has championed hawkish border policy in Washington, D.C., and tracked data that demonstrates the consequences of lax enforcement — such as when the group collected data on how substantially fewer criminal illegal migrants are being removed from the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration compared to Trump’s time in office.

There were 423,102 deportations of criminal aliens under the first three fiscal years of the Trump administration, with that number falling to 134,617 during the same time period under the current administration, NICE uncovered. Those numbers marked a 74% decrease in removals altogether.

NICE advocates for the end of catch-and-release of illegal migrants at the border, the abolition of sanctuary city laws, requiring all employers in the country to use E-Verify, among numerous other hawkish policies.

“President Trump will be ready, Congress just needs to provide the resources,” RJ Hauman, president of NICE, said to the DCNF. He added that more detention beds are needed and called for “immediate” GPS monitoring of every illegal migrant on the non-detained docket in order to properly conduct sweeping deportations.

“Our champions of interior enforcement will be sure to lead the charge on Capitol Hill,” Hauman said.

The lawmakers said they are ready to work with their allies and hit the ground running if Trump occupies the Oval Office in January.

“I am deeply grateful to the National Immigration Center for Enforcement for all their work pushing back on the open-borders, anti-enforcement policies of the Biden-Harris administration, and to inform the American people about the damage these policies have caused,” Green said of the organization. “I encourage my colleagues on the Hill to consider partnering with them in pursuit of creative and effective policy solutions to this self-inflicted crisis.”

“I’ve been proud to work with some great allies on this bill, including the National Immigration Center for Enforcement,” Cruz said, referring to his Justice for Jocelyn Act. “Together, we will act to stop the crimes enabled by this Biden-Harris administration.”

The future direction of federal energy policy related to the transportation sector is a key question that will be determined in one way or another by the outcome of the presidential election. What remains unclear is the extent of change that a Trump presidency would bring.

Given that Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk is a major supporter of former President Donald Trump, it seems unlikely a Trump White House would move to try to end the EV subsidies and tax breaks included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Those provisions, of course, constitute the “carrot” end of the Biden-Harris carrot-and-stick suite of policies designed to promote the expansion of EVs in the U.S. market. (RELATED: CARLA SANDS: Peace Through Strength Requires American Energy)

The “stick” side of that approach comes in the form of stricter tailpipe emissions rules and higher fleet auto-mileage requirements imposed on domestic carmakers. While a Harris administration would likely seek to impose even more federal pressure through such command-and-control regulatory measures, a Trump administration would likely be more inclined to ease them.

But doing that is difficult and time-consuming and much would depend on the political will of those Trump appoints to lead the relevant agencies and departments.

Those and other coercive EV-related policies imposed during the Biden-Harris years have been designed to move the U.S. auto industry directionally to meet the administration’s stated goal of having EVs make up a third of the U.S. light duty fleet by 2030. The suite of policies does not constitute a hard mandate per se but is designed to produce a similar pre-conceived outcome.

It is the sort of heavy-handed federal effort to control markets that Trump has spoken out against throughout his first term in office and his pursuit of a second term.

A new report released this week by big energy data and analytics firm Enverus seems likely to influence prospective Trump officials to take a more favorable view of the potential for EVs to grow as a part of the domestic transportation fleet. Perhaps the most surprising bit of news in the study, conducted by Enverus subsidiary Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR), is a projection that EVs are poised to be lower-priced than their equivalent gas-powered models as soon as next year, due to falling battery costs. (RELATED: Biden-Harris Admin Taps Org That Backs Open Borders, Reparations To Help Dole Out Taxpayer Dollars In Red States)

“Battery costs have fallen rapidly, with 2024 cell costs dipping below $100/kWh. We predict from [2025] forward EVs will be more affordable than their traditional, internal combustible engine counterparts,” Carson Kearl, analyst at EIR, says in the release. Kearl further says that EIR expects the number of EVs on the road in the US to “exceed 40 million (20%) by 2035 and 80 million (40%) by 2040.”

The falling battery costs have been driven by a collapse in lithium prices. Somewhat ironically, that price collapse has in turn been driven by the failure of EV expansion to meet the unrealistic goal-setting mainly by western governments, including the United States. Those same cause-and-effect dynamics would most likely mean that prices for lithium, batteries and EVs would rise again if the rapid market penetration projected by EIR were to come to fruition. (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: Here’s Who Would Guide Energy Policy In A Harris-Walz Administration)

In the U.S. market, the one and only certainty of all of this is that something is going to have to change, and soon. On Monday, Ford Motor Company reported it lost another $1.2 billion in its Ford Model e EV division in the 3rd quarter, bringing its accumulated loss for the first 9 months of 2024 to $3.7 billion.

Energy analyst and writer Robert Bryce points out in his Substack newsletter that that Model e loss is equivalent to the $3.7 billion profit Ford has reported this year in its Ford Blue division, which makes the company’s light duty internal combustion cars and trucks.

While Tesla is doing fine, with recovering profits and a rising stock price amid the successful launch of its CyberTruck and other new products, other pure-play EV makers in the United States are struggling to survive. Ford’s integrated peers GM and Stellantis have also struggled with the transition to more EV model-heavy fleets.

None of this is sustainable, and a recalibration of policy is in order. Next Tuesday’s election will determine which path the redirection of policy takes.

Republicans in tight Senate races less than a week ahead of Election Day are pouncing on President Biden calling supporters of former President Trump "garbage" in a final push to rally support for down-ballot GOP races.

Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick released a campaign ad Wednesday showing video footage of Biden’s remarks, followed by footage of his incumbent competitor, Sen. Bob Casey, heaping praise on Biden.

"Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community," Biden said during a campaign call at the White House Tuesday. "Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage.

"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American."

'VINDICTIVE': DEMOCRAT IN TIGHT SENATE RACE BLASTED BY GOP RIVAL FOR SWIPE AT MCDONALD'S AFTER TRUMP VISIT

The McCormick ad showed Biden’s remarks and video showing Casey praising Biden as a man of unparalleled "integrity."

"Clean up their mess on Nov. 5. Vote Republican. Vote Dave McCormick," a voiceover in the ad says.

Biden’s comments set off a lightning storm of criticism from Republicans nationwide, with some comparing it to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s "basket of deplorables" comment during a fundraiser during her failed 2016 campaign, which was viewed as likely undermining her campaign.

"We are not garbage. We are patriots who love America," Sen. Marco Rubio said at a Trump rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Tuesday.

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

The White House has attempted to backtrack Biden’s comment, saying it was in reference specifically to remarks made during Trump’s massive Madison Square Garden rally Sunday evening. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, host of the popular podcast "Kill Tony," sparked backlash after he cracked a joke hours ahead of Trump taking the stage at Madison Square Garden that Puerto Rico is a "floating island of garbage."

The White House attempted to walk back the president’s comments Tuesday evening. Administration spokesman Andrew Bates told Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich Biden’s remark "referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’"

Biden added in a follow-up clarification on X he was referring to the comedian’s rhetoric, not Trump supporters across the board.

"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it," Biden wrote in a post on X. "His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation."

TRUMP, HARRIS MAKE FINAL PITCHES TO VOTERS IN HIGH-STAKES BATTLEGROUND STATE IN FINAL DAYS OF CYCLE

"Sen. Casey respects all Pennsylvanians regardless of how they vote," Casey campaign spokesperson Maddy McDaniel told Fox News Digital when approached for comment about McCormick’s ad.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee also unleashed on Biden’s comments, pointing to four Democrats in tight races against Republican challengers — Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is running for the Senate in Arizona — for previous negative comments about Trump supporters.

TRUMP MAKES FRIES AT PENNSYLVANIA MCDONALD'S: ‘I’VE NOW WORKED FOR 15 MINUTES MORE THAN KAMALA'

The NRSC compared Biden’s remarks to Baldwin saying in 2016 that Republicans were failing a "moral test" for their Trump support and Gallego claiming in 2016 that Trump’s campaign "drew out the worst people in the world."

"These Democrats have spent years attacking Donald Trump and his supporters as deplorable and racist, even calling them ‘the worst people in the world.’ Now that they’re shamelessly pandering for support from Trump supporters, voters need to know if they will condemn Joe Biden’s disgusting remarks or fall in line yet again," NRSC spokesman Philip Letsou said in comment about the four Democrats.

The Trump campaign also condemned the remarks, claiming Biden and Vice President Harris not only "hate President Trump," they also "despise" his millions of supporters.

VOTER REGISTRATION PROBES LAUNCHED IN CRUCIAL KEYSTONE STATE COUNTIES AMID CLAIMS OF POTENTIAL FRAUD

"President Trump is backed by Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents and Americans of all faiths, and Harris, Walz and Biden have labeled these great Americans as fascists, Nazis and, now, garbage. There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him. Kamala does not deserve four more years. President Trump will be a president for ALL Americans," Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in comment.

McCormick joined "Fox & Friends" Wednesday, where he condemned Biden’s rhetoric and demanded an apology.

"Any time you call half of Americans garbage, because half the population is supporting President Trump, I think this is the kind of divisive rhetoric that we need to get out of politics. I think it's terribly polarizing. And, so, not only has President Biden, Kamala Harris and Bob Casey had policies that have hurt more than half of Americans with skyrocketing prices, the fentanyl crisis. Now, they're actually showing disrespect for him. So I hope the president will apologize for that," McCormick said while speaking to Fox News from a diner in Gap, Pennsylvania, Wednesday.

"I think it shows how they really feel about people that support President Trump," he said.

Harris also distanced herself from Biden's remarks Wednesday, saying her final pitch speech to voters in Washington, D.C., Tuesday reflected that she would govern all Americans if elected, no matter their political party.

"I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear. I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for," Harris said.

"You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career," Harris said. "I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not, and as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not."
Miriam Adelson, the principal owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, has put down $100 million on Donald Trump to win the 2024 presidential election. This is despite the caterwauling of minority owner and extreme left-wing advocate Mark Cuban, who has been all-in for Kamala Harris.

Cuban has jumped in front of every microphone he can find to push for the election of Kamala Harris. Still, the team for which he used to be the majority owner and is now a minority owner is apparently working to the contrary, according to Front Office Sports.

Adelson has been a top Republican donor since inheriting her husband’s fortune. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson was also a big GOP backer but passed away in 2021. Since then, his wife has kept the GOP faith and remained a top donor.

Miriam Adelson, a doctor who specializes in substance addiction, bought out Mark Cuban’s majority ownership of the Mavericks in 2023. However, Cuban still owns a bit more than one-fourth of the team.

The two, though, could not be more different politically. Cuban, who recently said Trump “absolutely” has “fascist tendencies,” is a staunch left-winger. However, he also claims he has not donated to the Harris campaign despite being a loud mouthpiece for her.

It appears Cuban is unwilling to let political differences stand in the way of making a buck, or several billion of them.

While Adelson is by far the biggest political donor for the GOP in the NBA, several other owners have also contributed hefty cash to politics.

Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta donated $420,000 to several PACs working for Trump’s second term. However, he also gave $13,200 to Harris PACs.

Minnesota Lynx and Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor donated to the GOP, but it wasn’t to Trump. Taylor, who was himself a GOP state senator from Minnesota, donated $2,000 to Nikki Haley before she dropped out of the primary race.

Meanwhile, Sixers Co-Owner David Blitzer also signed on with Haley, making a personal donation of the maximum of $3,300. But since Haley failed, he turned to Harris, giving $31,600 to a Harris PAC.

Meanwhile, Indiana Pacers and Fever owner Herb Simon donated $100,000 to pro-Harris PACs.

Even excluding Adelson, NBA owners have given a bit more to Trump ($424,650) than Harris ($274,800).

Far-left comedian Billy Eichner has revived his once popular “Billy on the Street” videos, with the help of actor Will Ferrell, in a cringey push to get people to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, with less than a week to go before Election Day.

Re-branding his schtick as “Loud White Men for Kamala,” Eichner and comedian Will Ferrell are seen in the video running around the streets of New York City urging people to vote for Harris.

In the video, the pair badger people on the street to admit whether they would “have sex with a Trump voter,” asking them who they are voting for, and quizzing them on their favorite Will Ferrell film.

Eichner’s publicist told the media that the comedian aims to “do everything we possibly can to protect Americans from Donald Trump in these crucial final days of Early Voting and exactly one week before Election Day,” according to Deadline.

Ferrell had long since endorsed Harris, but was also recently in a controversial video urging newly naturalized American citizens to view America as flawed and to hate Republicans.

Eichner is also along-time, left-wing activist, and recently warned the party that it was “time to panic” as Donald Trump and Republicans have surged in polling show that the elephant party is coming close to winning the 2024 elections and have erased all the gains that Harris and the Democrats had made after she was anointed as the Democrat nominee.

“It is time to fucking panic, okay? And not just panic but to do something about it. Because like many people are saying today, the polls are not good,” Eichner said in a social media video. “Trump has the momentum.”

LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Nevada’s mail-in voting rules mean final results in close races may not be available on election night.

In 2020, the Associated Press did not call the presidential race in Nevada until four days after the election. While a repeat scenario is not top of mind for every voter, several who spoke with the DCNF at early voting locations were troubled by the current system.

“We need to make sure we don’t have fraudulent ballots coming in or ineligible voters sending in stuff well after the election,” Joe, a Trump voter who has lived in Las Vegas for 10 years, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So I think everything needs to be in by Election Day.”

The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday that mail-in ballots without any postmark can still be counted if they are received within three days of the election.

“If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,” the court determined.

Under state law, ballots postmarked on or before election day can also be counted up to four days after.

“Requiring ballots to be postmarked on or before election day is a critical election integrity safeguard that ensures ballots mailed after election day are not counted,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Claire Zunk said in a statement to the DCNF. “It is also a requirement of Nevada law. By allowing Nevada officials to ignore the law’s postmark requirement, the state’s highest court has undermined the integrity of Nevada’s elections.”

In 2022, slightly more than half of Nevada’s votes were cast using mail-in ballots, according to a report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.

Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said whether the race is called that night depends on how many ballots come in after Election Day.

“We won’t really know because there is no way to predict that,” he told the DCNF. “But it is a monumentally stupid decision that invites fraud by bad actors who may try to gather up ballots that have not been voted and then submit them after Election Day as they see the preliminary, unofficial results.”

Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar did implement several measures to speed up the process this year, including allowing tabulation of early voting returns beginning at 8 am on Election Day. Mail ballots can be counted beginning 15 days before the election, according to guidance given to the counties. (RELATED: Swing State Republicans Are Leaning Into Ballot Harvesting — And It Seems To Be Working)

“This year, the country will be looking to Nevada to determine the winner of the Presidential election,” Aguilar wrote in May. “Voters deserve available results on election night; releasing results sooner will increase transparency, help us combat misinformation and alleviate pressure on election officials.”

Zach, a Democrat who is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris because of abortion, felt for the first time this cycle that he needed to vote in-person. While he does not believe the laws need to be changed, he told the DCNF he was “nervous” about sending his mail-in ballot, especially after fires were set to dropboxes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington.

“I don’t want to risk that,” he said.

Edward, a Trump voter whose top issues were immigration and reducing the deficit, told the DCNF he was “very concerned” by late results from mail-in ballots. “That needs to go,” he said. “It needs to be in-person and show an ID. And it should get done the same day by 10 o’clock.”

“You should vote either in-person or by the day and show who you are,” Angela, a Trump voter, told the DCNF. (RELATED: Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires)

George Guthrie, spokesman for Washoe County’s election office, told the DCNF the results are unofficial until certified by the board of county commissioners on Nov. 15. Before that date, it’s difficult to estimate “when every vote is counted,” he said.

“I can say however the office is confident in having the majority of our results released on Election Night when all polls are closed across the state,” he said, explaining in-person votes from election day and early voting, as well as mail ballots processed to that point, will be counted. However, not all votes will be received on election night as “ballots are most likely in the mail in transit to our office.”

Washoe County is a swing county with the second greatest population in the state.

In the more populated Clark County, where Democrats typically lead, the elections department did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the anticipated timeline for results.

This year, Nevada residents are also voting on a ballot question that would amend the state constitution to require voter identification. (RELATED: Republicans Hopeful ‘Historic’ Early Vote Turnout Could Enable Unexpected Swing State Candidate To Flip The Senate)

Despite lingering concerns about the new rules, Republicans in the state have leaned into ballot harvesting, which became legal in 2020, and pushed supporters to vote early. During a Trump rally last week, some voters took advantage of a return for mail-in ballots offered on-site.

The party has seen great success in early voting, surpassing previous years. Republicans lead by over 40,000 votes as of Wednesday morning.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign appears to be pulling a considerable amount of advertising money from North Carolina just days before the election. The move comes as polling trends in former President Donald Trump’s direction and Republicans overtake Democrats in early voting.

According to AdImpact, an advertisement tracking firm, Harris pulled at least $2 million of her initial $2.7 million buy from North Carolina media markets. The only media market where the Harris campaign has kept its ads is Raleigh, which, according to the Carolina Journal, is the only one in which she is leading former President Donald Trump in the polls.

Trump campaign Senior Advisor Chris LaCivita said on social media he believes the Harris campaign could be reallocating the money to Virginia (a blue state in presidential elections since 2008). If Harris is trying to “stop the slide” in the commonwealth, as LaCivita suggests, it could portend devastation for her electoral prospects come Nov. 5.

The move comes just one day before both Harris and Trump are scheduled to hold campaign events in the state. A recent Elon University poll showed Trump and Harris tied at 46% among registered voters. Another poll showed Trump with a slight lead, 47.2% to 46.6%. The RealClear Polling average shows Trump with a one-point lead in the state and ahead in every battleground except Michigan.

The Republican lead in North Carolina almost doubled from yesterday!



Rumor has it that the Kamala campaign is shifting resources to shore up Virginia, which means they’re worried about losing Virginia.

While polling is a more fickle indicator of electoral success, Republicans are also leading Democrats in early voting, 1,059,258 to 1,024,661, with another million registered as unaffiliated. Compared to this time in 2020, Democrat turnout is down by about 341,000 voters, while Republicans are up by about 9,000.

The Trump campaign is also facing somewhat of an uphill battle in North Carolina, as a key region of Republican voters, western North Carolina, was ravaged by Hurricane Helene.

That area, which brought a net 247,217 votes for Trump in 2020, has seen a slow-rolled relief effort from Democrats in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state officials, leaving many to question whether voter suppression is going on in the area. Trump only won the state by about 75,000 votes in 2020.

As The Federalist reported, Democrats in charge of some county elections boards have rejected plans to make emergency voting locations in response to the disaster, requiring the state legislature to compel them to do so.

Virginia’s polling margins are not as close as North Carolina, but a recent Rasmussen Reports poll showed Trump only trailing Harris by two points. While the RealClear average has Harris with a 5.8% lead, President Joe Biden won the commonwealth by over ten points in 2020.

The Trump campaign just won a major victory that should scare Democrats hoping to see a drop in Republican voter turnout.

The Republican National Committee (RNC) and former President Donald Trump’s campaign prevailed in a lawsuit Wednesday against Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to extend early voting by three days.

Trump’s campaign filed the lawsuit Tuesday alleging voter suppression after viral videos of supporters complaining that they were turned away from their polling places despite being in line to vote by 5:00 pm. The original deadline to vote early in person in Pennsylvania ended Oct. 29, but the court’s ruling means that the state has to extend its early voting until Nov.1.

The RNC chairman, Michael Whatley, announced the win on X, promising that the GOP “will keep fighting” and asking voters to “stay in line.” (ROOKE: Trump’s Greatest Campaign Surrogate Is Single-Handedly Crushing Harris’ Momentum)

“PENNSYLVANIA LAWSUIT VICTORY We just won the Trump Campaign/RNC lawsuit against Bucks County, PA,” Whatley said. “We will now have extended early in-person mail-voting through November 1st — three extra days. We will keep fighting. Go vote! Stay in line!”

The RNC promised to be more proactive in protecting voter integrity in 2024 after the chaos during the 2020 election. It claims to have hired thousands of lawyers deployed across the country to ensure they can quickly adjudicate election issues that arise. This win means three extra days for Republicans to increase the early voter turnout they need in order for Trump to win the critical swing state.

I spoke to a former party official a while back who told me that the biggest problem in 2020 was not having poll watchers and lawyers on standby ready to call bs and file suits immediately.

The Real Clear Polling average has Trump up over Harris by just 0.7%, making Pennsylvania a true toss-up state. Republicans shortened the gap in voter registrations since the last presidential election, however, making it a more challenging win for Democrats than when President Joe Biden won the state in 2020. (ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)

DecisionDeskHQ author Michael Pruser reported that Tuesday’s Pennsylvania early voting data showed Republicans outvoted Democrats for the first time since early voting began. “Philadelphia was one of the big three way out in front in returns. Now Philadelphia is well behind in returns and it doesn’t appear it has anything to do with a processing delay. Without Philly pulling it’s weight, Republicans are likely to finish ahead in overall return rate,” Pruser said.

Part of the reason the margin is closing quickly in PA is the return rate in Philadelphia. If you remember, early on, Philadelphia was one of the big three way out in front in returns.

As of Tuesday, 1.55 million votes had been cast, roughly 23% of the expected electorate, according to Pruser. Democrats currently have a 380,043 vote lead over Republicans, which is considerably lower than at this same time in 2020 when Democrats had a 1.1 million vote lead.

The RNC’s win gives Republicans three more days to close the gaps and increase their voter turnout before election day, which should scare Democrats who needed low Republican returns. While Harris is still in the race to win Pennsylvania, it looks like she won’t be able to count on Philadelphia to pull her over the edge in the same way it did for Biden. This lawsuit might be the final momentum shift Trump needed to secure him Pennsylvania’s 19 Electoral College votes.
Georgia’s top elections official is accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of lying about the state’s voter security laws.

Without naming Harris, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger took aim at her comments during a campaign speech in Michigan earlier this week.

"Frustratingly, recently, a candidate repeated that lie that we will lock up people that give water to voters waiting in line to vote," Raffensperger said. "That's a lie, because we don't have any lines in Georgia. It's just cheap politics."

He also took aim at Democrats' overall criticism of Georgia's voter security laws, "We have worked tirelessly to prepare for this election by adding early voting days and investing in infrastructure, creating more security and more voter convenience…only to be rewarded with the lies about ‘Jim Crow 2.0."

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Harris has not referred to the Georgia laws as "Jim Crow 2.0," but she has criticized the state's limits on handing out food and water in voter lines.

Harris said in Ann Arbor on Monday night, "I was just in Georgia. You know they passed a law that makes it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote?"

"The hypocrisy abounds. Whatever happened to ‘love thy neighbor,’ right?" she added as the supportive crowd jeered.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for a response to Raffensperger.

The remark also got pushback from Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who mocked Harris’ short-lived 2020 presidential bid.

"Sounds like Kamala Harris just can’t handle the truth," Kemp wrote on X on Tuesday. "We made it easier to vote and harder to cheat in Georgia. As a result, more than 3 million Georgians have already voted — that’s 3 million more votes than the Vice President got in the 2024 primaries."

Georgia officials moved to implement several new voting laws after the 2020 race put the Peach State under a microscope.

Among them was limiting the number of ballot drop boxes – which were not used in Georgia before 2020 – and restricting political groups from giving food and water to voters waiting in line on Election Day within a certain distance from their polling place.

Georgia also installed new ID requirements for absentee ballots.

Democratic organizations and civil rights groups accused Republican officials of restricting voter access with the measures.

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

But Raffensperger and other Republicans have pushed back on those attacks, particularly in the wake of record-setting voter turnout in Georgia since early voting got underway on Oct. 15.

As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 45% of active Georgia voters have cast pre-Election Day ballots.

Meanwhile, Raffensperger cautioned both candidates to accept a loss "gracefully," comparing it to his grandson losing his recent baseball playoff game.

"As soon as they came up short, and they lost, I know that they were disappointed. But what they did, because both teams were good sportsmen, they lined up, and they did that passing of shaking each other's hand and said, ‘Congratulations, good game,’" he said.

"As a grandparent, I'm proud to see that. But just as an American, I think that's wonderful, because I think that's what America is – is gracefully accepting your wins, but also gracefully accepting your losses."

He vowed, "I will hold both parties accountable to you, the voters of Georgia."
FIRST ON FOX: Susan B. Anthony Pro-life America, a group that seeks to "end abortion" in the United States, has knocked on 4 million doors in swing states to reach voters they say can be persuaded to oppose candidates and ballot initiatives that would expand abortion access.

Earlier this year, the group set out an ambitious goal of raising and spending $92 million to boost candidates for office who advocate for laws restricting abortion. Now, Susan B. Anthony Pro-life America representatives say they have met that goal and have a strong ground game in key battleground states, where volunteers are making the case that Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris is too extreme on abortion.

Rachel Schroder, a Hillsdale College senior who volunteered as a canvasser and deployed to Milwaukee, Wisc., for three days, told Fox News Digital in an interview that voters were open to changing who they support when engaged conversationally, face-to-face.

"We know that Kamala Harris and [Wisconsin Democratic Senator] Tammy Baldwin both have refused to set any sort of limits on when abortions can be done in pregnancy, even when a baby is fully developed, can live outside the womb and can see and hear its mom's voice," said Schroder, adding that Baldwin voted against a GOP-backed bill to require medical care for babies who survive an attempted abortion.

MAJOR PRO-LIFE GROUP LAYS OUT AGRESSIVE PLANS FOR 2024 ELECTIONS: LARGEST GROUND GAME YET'

"This is way too extreme for Wisconsin. This is way too extreme for America. And we're just here to inform voters so that they can make the commonsense choice when they go to the ballots in November."

Reached for comment, Baldwin spokesman Andrew Mamo said the Wisconsin senator is "proud to champion the Women’s Health Protection Act which would restore the protections afforded by Roe v Wade ensuring women, not politicians like Eric Hovde, can make their own decisions about their health care."

More than one thousand students like Schroder participated in Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America's voter contact program and knocked on over 1 million doors, the largest ever for the program. National Field Team Director Patricia Miles said the group has reached more than 10 million low-turnout and persuadable voters in eight battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and the aforementioned Wisconsin.

Similar to that of other advocacy groups throughout the United States, SBA Pro-Life America has reached voters through a variety of means like digital, messaging, mail and phones.

Abortion was tied with immigration for second-place as the most important issue for voters in the 2024 cycle, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College survey. Twenty-seven percent of voters said the economy ranked as their chief concern, and immigration and abortion followed at 15 percent each.

2024 SHOWDOWN: HARRIS, TRUMP HOLD DUELING TEXAS RALLIES TO HAMMER HOME THESE KEY ISSUES

The stakes are high this November since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, permitting states to enact their own laws governing abortion. Republican lawmakers have sought to restrict the procedure, calling it immoral to kill an unborn baby. Several Democratic states have expanded abortion access, arguing that the government should not exert control over women's bodies and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy rests solely with women and their doctors.

Ten states have abortion-related ballot measures this year, including Arizona and Florida, where voters will decide if the right to terminate a pregnancy should be constitutionally protected. Support for expanding abortion rights has crossed party lines. Voters in red states including Kansas and Ohio have previously given majority approval to ballot measures that enshrined abortion rights, dealing stinging blows to the pro-life movement.

TRUMP, HARRIS DEAD EVEN IN NATIONAL POLL, WITH JUST ONE IN FOUR SAYING COUNTRY HEADED IN RIGHT DIRECTION

"When we see states like Kansas who are supporting abortion in their state constitutions, it's deeply troubling because we know that every baby cradled in their mother's womb deserves to be cradled in their parent's arms," said Schroder.

But she remains hopeful that when women in crisis pregnancies are shown the resources available to them through groups like SBA Pro Life America, they will choose not to abort.

"I see a pro-life future because I see so many other students like myself who are willing to sacrifice their school breaks to defend life. I see my community. I see my friends. I see my family saying this is important to us and it's not just important to us, but this is an issue the American people are paying attention to. And I think the American people is a deeply compassionate people."

The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
North Carolina likely voters put former President Trump ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest, according to a new Fox News survey. That’s unchanged since September.

Trump is ahead by 49%-47% among likely voters, while third-party candidates receive 4%. In the two-way contest, his edge narrows to 1 point — a useful indicator as pre-election surveys often overstate support for third-party candidates.

Among the larger universe of registered voters, Harris is up by 1 point on both the expanded ballot (48%-47%) and head-to-head (50%-49%).

The differences between Harris and Trump on all ballot tests fall within the margin of error.

The previous Fox News survey of North Carolina voters, released in September, also had Trump favored by just a touch among likely voters and Harris narrowly up among registered voters.

Looking at results on the full ballot among likely voters, Trump is favored among Whites without a college degree, White voters overall, rural voters and voters ages 65 and over.

Harris is preferred among Black voters, urban voters, voters with a college degree and those under age 35. She also has a small edge among suburban voters, driven by her wider margin among suburban women than Trump’s lead among suburban men.

FOX NEWS POLL: MORE HARRIS THAN TRUMP SUPPORTERS THINK VOTERS WILL BE COUNTED ACCURATELY & WILL ACCEPT OUTCOME

Trump is meeting or exceeding his 2020 numbers among these groups, while Harris’ support trails what President Biden received among Blacks, young voters and suburban voters, according to the North Carolina Fox News Voter Analysis election survey.

There is a 20-point gender gap, as men back Trump by 13 points and women go for Harris by 7.

The former president is helped by North Carolina having more of the kinds of voters who make up his base. More identify as Republican than Democrat, fewer have college degrees and there are far more rural than urban voters.

Trump has won the Tar Heel state twice, in 2016 by nearly 4 percentage points and in 2020 by just over 1 point. In the last 20 years, former President Obama was the only Democrat to win North Carolina, and that was by less than half a point in 2008.

"Whoever wins North Carolina will likely do two things, win the suburbs with a stronger closing message and maximize turnout in their base areas," says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw.

When likely voters are asked who they trust to handle top issues, they favor Trump on immigration (by 17 points), the conflict in the Middle East (+10), and the economy (+6). Harris is preferred to handle election integrity (+4) and abortion (+12).

Some 14% of Harris supporters trust Trump on handling immigration, while 11% of those backing Trump trust Harris on abortion.

By a 5-point margin, more voters see Trump as a strong leader, while more say Harris has the right temperament to be president by 5 points. There are smaller differences on helping the middle class (Harris +3), protecting American democracy (Harris +3), fighting for people like you (Harris +1), bringing needed change (Trump +2) and saying what they believe rather than what will get them elected (Trump +3).

More Trump backers (75%) than Harris backers (71%) say they are extremely interested in the election, while over 9 in 10 of each candidate's backers say they are certain of their vote choice.

By a 4-point margin, more voters view both Harris and Trump negatively than positively, 48% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable for each. By comparison, President Biden’s personal rating is underwater by 13 points (43%-56%).

Harris is up by 2 points among the 4 in 10 who say they have already voted (50%-48%). Overall, voters who say they will cast their ballot early favor Trump by 1 point, while he is favored among those planning to vote on Election Day by 7 points.

In the governor’s race, Democrat Josh Stein leads Republican Mark Robinson by 16 points, 57%-41%.

Support for Stein overperforms support for Harris because 14% of those backing him also favor Trump in the presidential race.

"Despite carrying a troubled gubernatorial candidate and having to mobilize voters in areas devastated by the hurricane, Trump continues to run slightly ahead by generating enthusiastic support among key Republican constituencies," notes Shaw.

Poll-pourri

Among the larger sample of registered voters …

— Harris gets a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump receives from Republicans (93%), as well as narrowly capturing independents (46% vs. Trump’s 41%, within the margin of error).

— While Trump enjoys the backing of 76% of non-MAGA Republicans, Harris gets 17%, with another 5% favoring a third-party candidate (there are too few to breakout among the likely voter subsample).

— Trump’s advantage has narrowed to just 3 percentage points on handling the economy, down from a 7-point lead last month and a 9-point lead in August.

— Equal numbers of voters say they are holding steady financially as say they are falling behind (44% each), while only 1 in 10 feel their family is getting ahead. Those numbers are unchanged since February, despite major flooding and damage from Hurricane Helene in September.

Conducted Oct. 24-28 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,113 North Carolina registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (164) and cellphones (685) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (264). Results based on the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 872 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Likely voters are based on a probabilistic statistical model that relies on past voting history, interest in the current election, age, education, race, ethnicity, church attendance and marital status.

The corporate media’s corruption is so predictable.

Several weeks ago, when the controversy first emerged over New York Magazine correspondent Olivia Nuzzi engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a story subject — then-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — I predicted how the magazine would deal with the controversy, largely by covering it up. Thus far, the magazine has followed that prediction to a T.

In so doing, however, New York Magazine revealed how corporate media betray their prejudices. In many if not most occasions, the true corruption comes not from what media figures write, but what they decide not to write.

Magazine’s Whitewash

New York Magazine’s Oct. 21 update on the controversy read in its entirety:

Last month, the magazine enlisted the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine to review Olivia Nuzzi’s work during the 2024 campaign. They reached the same conclusion as the magazine’s initial internal review of her published work, finding no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias. Nevertheless, the magazine and Nuzzi agreed that the best course forward is to part ways. Nuzzi is a uniquely talented writer and we have been proud to publish her work over her nearly eight years as our Washington Correspondent. We wish her the best.

In noting the fact that representatives for the magazine would not answer my questions about whether it would release the full results of its “independent” investigation so that readers could judge the behavior of the magazine for itself, I guessed that New York Mag would likely put out “a short and sanitized summary while keeping the damning details private,” use the report to fire Nuzzi, and let another Democrat outlet hire her quietly in several months. In short, they’d employ a “solution” to paper over the issue without dealing with the underlying problem.

Other than avoiding the word “fire” or “terminate” in the statement — which lawyers for Nuzzi and the magazine likely spent hours negotiating over — that’s exactly what happened. Hush up the matter, let Nuzzi go to some other leftist publication, and move on as quickly as possible.

Bias of Omission

But the tell came in the statement claiming that New York Magazine and the “independent” review discovered “no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias” in Nuzzi’s “published work.” Those two cleverly parsed words leave a hole big enough to drive a Mack truck through — because the problem isn’t the words Nuzzi did write, but the words she didn’t.

As I noted several weeks ago, Nuzzi, by her own admission, withheld evidence for months about President Joe Biden’s mental decline that she first came to know about in January and saw firsthand during events surrounding the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in April. She failed to publish anything on the matter until July, after Biden’s atrocious performance in the June presidential debate finally made his health and mental fitness a topic that neither the media nor Biden could ignore.

But ignore the matter both Nuzzi and her colleagues did for months. And in Nuzzi’s case, she has admitted she sat on damning information about one presidential candidate (Biden) that she witnessed with her own eyes, even as she was having an inappropriate relationship with another presidential candidate (Kennedy).

Read Between the Lines

In many cases, reporters demonstrate their corruption not through their words but through their silence. I had one admit as much to me in October 2020, claiming that colleagues would not write negative stories about Biden for fear of costing him the election. That statement speaks both to the weakness of Joe Biden as a candidate — whereby reporters feared that a single story could cashier his entire presidential campaign — and the corrupt ways in which the media silence stories that do not meet their preferred narrative.

The examples are almost too numerous to mention. They also go well beyond the “conspiracy of silence” regarding Biden’s mental health condition in the months and years leading up to the June presidential debate, and the stories about Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop the media suppressed four years ago.

For instance, how many Americans know that, while serving in the Senate, Joe Biden offered legislation to sunset Medicare and Social Security every four years? Was the press too lazy to dig into Biden’s lengthy Senate career or too corrupt to report on the results when they did? (More likely both.) Why was an outlet like Politico fixated — one could say obsessed — with the taxes of former President Donald Trump, even as current President Joe Biden was spending months trying to get legislation through Congress to raise a Medicare tax Biden went to great lengths to avoid paying himself?

Put simply, New York Magazine’s statement claiming it suffered no damage to its integrity from l’affaire des Nuzzi isn’t credible for the same reason the corporate media as a whole aren’t credible: What the press doesn’t say is far more powerful than what it does.
Democrats and their media allies are in full-on damage control mode after Joe Biden referred to supporters of Donald Trump as “garbage.”

Not long after the president made the revolting comments Tuesday evening, left-wing propagandists masquerading as journalists went to work distorting Biden’s smear in an apparent attempt to limit its impact on Kamala Harris’ flailing presidential campaign. Needless to say, their whitewashing of the controversy is nothing short of incredible.

Politico’s Johnathan Lemire contributed to the the wave of dishonest coverage with an article on Tuesday night portraying the scandal as another “Republicans pounce!” incident. Titled, “Biden sparks a firestorm on the right over ‘garbage,'” Lemire claimed in the piece’s opening paragraph that Biden only “appeared” to call Trump supporters “garbage,” before immediately following with the note: “though the president and his aides vehemently denied that was his intention.”

The outlet’s “Politico Playbook” writers exemplified their blatant partisanship on Wednesday by expressing greater worry about the comment’s impact on Harris’ campaign than the the sitting president villifying half the country as human scum. They also dismissed Republicans’ concerns about the incendiary nature of Biden’s remarks.

“You can certainly debate whether the comment genuinely has the power to move votes in the final week or if it’s a Beltway media obsession kindled by people who just days ago were telling people we have to stop getting so offended all the time,” they wrote.

CBS News was quick to follow the lead of the White House, which apparently gramatically altered the transcript of Biden’s remarks to make it seem like the president didn’t publicly dehumanize Trump supporters. Known for allegedly distorting its “60 Minutes” interview with Harris, the outlet played word games with its headline, which reads, “‘Supporters’ or ‘supporter’s’? Biden comments about Trump ‘garbage’ rally anger the GOP.”

These headlines are just straight up state media propaganda.



It’s on video. We all heard him say it pic.twitter.com/Bzz5LBTGfs — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 30, 2024

NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik decided to play doctor and mind reader for a day, telling his X followers he “listened to [Biden’s comments] several times” and came away with the conclusion that the president’s supposed “stutter” problem is to blame. Politico’s Lemire made a similar appeal.

“I think you have an octogenarian with a stutter for whom clarity is an increasing challenge,” Folkenfilk wrote. “Precisely why Biden was eased from race for reelection. Really don’t sense he’s calling Trump supporters garbage.”

The Washington Post also tried to downplay Biden’s “garbage” comment — which is on video — by effectively framing the smear as something that may or may not have happened. The “democracy dies in darkness” crowd ran with the headline, “White House, Trump campaign clash over whether Biden called Trump supporters ‘garbage.'” In the piece, reporter Patrick Svetik suggested, similarly to Folkenflik and Lemire, that the comment came as Biden “stumbled over his words” to disagree with a joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s during Trump’s Sunday Madison Square Garden rally.

Here’s how the Democrat propaganda outlet known as The New York Times characterized the matter: “Biden Appears to Insult Trump Supporters as ‘Garbage,’ but Quickly Tries to Clarify.”

“The View’s” Whoopi Goldberg took her outlandish commentary a step further, saying on Wednesday that Hillary Clinton was ultimately “right” when she called Trump supporters “deplorables” during the 2016 election.

HARRISBURG, Pa. – As Vice President Kamala Harris returned to Pennsylvania on Wednesday for her second trip in three days, three new polls indicate an incredibly close race between her and former President Donald Trump in the crucial swing state with less than a week until Election Day.

Trump stands at 47% support among Pennsylvania likely voters, with Harris at 46%, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. And a CNN poll indicated the race was a dead heat, with both major party nominees at 48% support.

Meanwhile, a Monmouth University survey indicated just under half of registered voters in Pennsylvania say they will either definitely or have already voted for the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee (42%) or will probably vote for her (5%).

An identical number will either definitely or have already voted for Trump (42%) or will probably vote for the former president and Republican presidential nominee (5%), in a separate question asked by the pollster.

HARRIS LAYS OUT HER CLOSING ARGUMENT AGAINST TRUMP WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AS A BACKDROP

With

19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania is the largest of the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and which will likely determine who wins the 2024 presidential election.

In the Quinnipiac survey - conducted Oct. 24-28 - Trump's one-point edge is a switch from their early October survey, when Harris held a three-point advantage.

In the new poll, Green Party candidate Jill Stein receives two percent support and Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver stands at one percent.

According to the Monmouth survey, when third-party and independent candidates are factored into the results, Trump stands at 47% among registered voters in Pennsylvania, with Harris at 46% and 4% saying they are definitely or probably backing another candidate.

HARRIS, TRUMP, MAKE FINAL PITCHES TO VOTERS IN HIGH STAKES BATTLEGROUND

The release from Monmouth University on their new poll emphasized in the headline that in Pennsylvania "it's really, really close."

"The bottom line is this was an incredibly close race in September and remains so today," Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said, as he compared the results of his new survey in the Keystone State with his previous poll in Pennsylvania.

The pollster spotlighted that Trump "continues to have a significant advantage among white voters without a college degree – who make up nearly half of Pennsylvania’s voter pool," topping Harris 60%-35% among this group.

However, the survey indicates that Harris holds a large 58%-37% lead among White college graduates, and voters who are Black, Hispanic and of other races (62% to 25%).

The Quinnpiac poll shows a widening of the gender gap.

Men backed Trump 57 – 37 percent - up nine points from their earlier October survey - while women back Harris 55 – 39 percent, which was mostly unchaged from earlier in the month.

"The gender gap widens with Trump increasing his lead among men, as what remains a very tight race heads into the final stretch," Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy emphasized.

With six days to go until Election Day, the new surveys follows other recent polls that point to an incredibly close contest in the Keystone State. A CBS News poll conducted Oct. 22-28 pointed to both major party candidates deadlocked at 49%.

WILL TRUMP ASK FORMER TOP GOP RIVAL NIKKI HALEY TO JOIN HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called "Blue Wall."

Democrats reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election over Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton to win the White House.

Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeat Trump.

Both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, as well as their running mates, have made repeated stops in the three states this summer and autumn.

The vice president on Wednesday, speaking in front of a large crowd at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center, urged her supporters to "get this done."

Harris made multiple stops Sunday in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. Trump held a campaign event Tuesday in Delaware County, in suburban Philadelphia, before holding a rally in Allentown.

"I don't like to speak too early, but you have to get out and vote because we … we want a big, beautiful number. We're leading in every single swing state. Because, normally Republicans, they like to vote at the end no matter what you say, they like to vote at the end," Trump said from the Allentown rally.

Trump's new pitch for early voting stands in contrast to his years of blaming the practice for what he continues to claim - without proof - that his 2020 election loss was due to "massive voter fraud."

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

Since Haris replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket after the president dropped out of the race in July, Fox News found the vice president has visited Pennsylvania at least 15 times, as of Tuesday.

Philadelphia was where Harris first teamed up with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after announcing him as her running mate. Harris hunkered down in Pittsburgh - the state's second-largest city - to prepare for her first and only debate with Trump, which was held in September in Philadelphia.

'I'M GOING WITH TRUMP': 3 FORMER DEMS FROM PENNSYLVANIA EXPLAIN HOW FORMER PRESIDENT WON THEM OVER

Trump has also visited the state at least 15 times since the end of July, Fox News found. Trump’s history with Pennsylvania was underscored by an assassination attempt on his life on July 13 in Butler, when a man named Mathew Crooks opened fire on Trump and his supporters. Trump was injured on the side of his head by the shooting, and two other rallygoers were also injured. Local man Corey Comperatore died protecting his family during the violence.

Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate, has visited the state at least 13 times since the start of August. Walz has visited Pennsylvania at least nine times since August, data compiled by Fox News found.

Both campaigns have spent more than half a billion dollars on ads alone in Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week. Democrats spent more than $294.7 million in Pennsylvania, while Republicans spent $243.6 million in the Keystone State. The funds spent far exceed ad buys in other battleground states, including Michigan, which trails Pennsylvania ad expenses by a combined $185 million.

AdImpact, a leading national ad-tracking firm, reported that the Trump campaign has reserved $5.8 million in ad time to run spots in the final stretch ahead of Election Day, with the Harris campaign shelling out $4.6 million.

When Biden narrowly carried Pennsylvania four years ago, Democrats enjoyed a larger margin of registered voters compared to their Republican counterparts, at 4.2 million to 3.5 million. The data shows that Democrats had a registration advantage over Republicans by 685,818 voters during the election that Biden won by 80,555 votes.

The GOP has whittled down that lead this year to a margin of 297,824. When comparing registered voters this election year to 2020, Democrats face a net loss of 257,281 voters, while Republicans have a net gain of 428,537 registered voters.

More than double the number of previously registered Democrats changed their party affiliation this cycle compared to the number of registered Republicans who left the party. Pennsylvania Department of State data shows 54,668 registered Democrats changed their party affiliation compared to 25,634 Republicans.

Besides being the biggest of the presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania is also home to one of a handful of crucial Senate races that will likely determine if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.

According to the Monmouth poll, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. holds a slight edge over Republican challenger Dave McCormick.

Both the CNN poll and the Quinnipiac survey indicated Casey with a three-point margin over McCormick.

Forty percent of those questioned said they would definitely vote for Casey, with another 7% saying they would probably cast a ballot for the senator. Thirty-six percent said they would definitely vote for McCormick, with 8% saying they would probably cast a ballot for the Republican nominee.

Fox News' Maria Paronich contributed to this report
One of former President Trump's largest super PACs on Wednesday launched a $50 million ad campaign across major cable networks and streaming service providers in all seven battleground states, making a "final pitch" to key voters in the final sprint to Election Day.

The ads, slated to air beginning Wednesday night, were funded by Make America Great Again, Inc., (or MAGA, Inc.) and previewed exclusively to Fox News before their release.

Each seeks to hit Vice President Kamala Harris by going after what the campaign views as her biggest weaknesses in the final stretch before the election.

One ad, titled "Are You Okay?" features a clip from Harris' remarks during the presidential debate against Trump this summer, when she spoke about her desire to put country over party.

"As a prosecutor, I never asked, ‘are you a Republican or a Democrat," she said then. "The only thing I ever asked is, ’are you okay?'"

The clip shows voters watching the footage of Harris, and responding bluntly with their biggest complaints about the job market, inflation and immigration — areas the campaign views as Harris' biggest weaknesses heading into Election Day.

"I'm working three jobs to get by," one person says in the ad. "Crime is out of control," says another.

The other ad, called "Broken Oath," appears to blame Harris directly for a litany of national security and foreign policy crises that unfolded over the last four years under the Biden administration, before urging voters to support Trump.

"Our troops, murdered. An open border. Crime in our streets. Skyrocketing costs. Assassination attempts," a narrator says, adding, "We're on the brink of World War III."

The Trump campaign has repeatedly sought to blame Harris for what it sees as the biggest failures of the Biden administration. Trump has frequently used this to hit his opponent on the campaign trail, telling voters at recent rallies, "Kamala broke it. I will fix it."

It is unclear how many of these policies — either at home or abroad — Harris could have exerted influence on in her role as vice president.

Since April, MAGA, Inc. has spent roughly $325 million in support of Trump's re-election campaign.

The super PAC has focused its resources primarily on boosting Trump's standing in swing states — especially among voters in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada — four states where Trump narrowly lost to Biden in 2020.

Earlier this month, it announced $10 million in additional spending on ads aimed at winning over Black and Hispanic voters in these competitive districts — targeting voters living in the city centers of Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta.

A spokesperson for the PAC told Fox News in a statement that the ads seek to drive home the message to voters that Trump will fix policy failings from the last four years.

"Put simply: The American people are not okay," Kaelan Dorr, a spokesperson for the PAC, told Fox News in a statement. Trump, he added, will "unite our country through success."

The country's eyes are again locked on Pennsylvania this election cycle, with former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris making their final pitches to Keystone State voters ahead of Election Day.

Trump held a massive rally at Manhattan’s Madison Square Garden Sunday evening in what was described as the 45th president’s final pitch to voters, while Harris made her final pitch in the nation’s capital Tuesday at the Ellipse, located just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.

Amid their high-profile closing arguments for the election cycle, both candidates have continued their laser focus on Pennsylvania, which is viewed as the state that will likely determine the overall outcome of the election.

Trump’s schedule this week included a rally Tuesday in Allentown, located about 60 miles north of Philadelphia, and another campaign stop Tuesday in Philadelphia’s suburbs of Delaware County. A campaign official told Fox News Digital Tuesday the campaign expects to announce additional events in the state ahead of Election Day, including surrogate events.

"I don't like to speak too early, but you have to get out and vote because we … we want a big, beautiful number. We're leading in every single swing state. Because, normally Republicans, they like to vote at the end no matter what you say, they like to vote at the end," Trump said from the Allentown rally.

RNC Chair Michael Whatley also spoke at the rally and declared,"Donald Trump needs Pennsylvania, and America needs Pennsylvania.

"We are going to swamp the vote. And we are not going to let the Democrats stop us. Nine years ago, Donald Trump came down that escalator at Trump Tower and said that he was going to make America Great again by protecting our southern border, by rebuilding our economy and making sure that America was strong enough to protect our interests and our allies around the world. Tonight, at the end of that room, as we enter the last eight, seven days before this election, Donald Trump is still fighting every single day for every single American and every single family and every single voter," he said.

Harris is expected to travel to Harrisburg, the state’s capital, on Wednesday, after visiting Philadelphia on Sunday. Harris’ rally is billed as a get-out-the-vote initiative in the waning days of the election. Surrogates and high-profile supporters of the Harris campaign are also flooding the state this week, including former President Clinton joining Democratic Sen. John Fetterman for a "Unity" event in Johnstown Tuesday and actor Martin Sheen holding a press conference in support of Harris ahead of Trump's Allentown visit on Tuesday.

'ADMIRES DICTATORS': HARRIS CONTINUES COMPARING TRUMP TO HITLER DURING BATTLEGROUND STATE TOWN HALL

Both campaigns have spent more than half a billion dollars in ads alone in Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week. Democrats spent more than $294.7 million in Pennsylvania, while Republicans spent $243.6 million in the Keystone State. The funds spent far exceed ad buys in other battleground states, including Michigan, which trails Pennsylvania ad expenses by a combined $185 million.

For the Trump campaign, tech billionaire Elon Musk has been featured prominently in Pennsylvania. The SpaceX CEO has jumped from events in Philadelphia's suburbs to the rolling hills of Amish country in Lancaster to rally support for the Republican ticket.

"I'm doing this because I think it's critical to the future of the country. If America falls, nothing else matters. We're not getting to Mars or anything," Musk said in Pittsburgh last week. "I'm hoping that we get President Trump elected, and then I'll work hard on the Department of Government efficiency."

ELON GOES ON CAMPAIGN BLITZ AGAINST GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, VOWS TO REVEAL BIZARRE ALLEGED SCHEMES

Musk announced earlier this month that voters in battleground states were eligible for a $1 million a day giveaway after signing the America PAC’s petition backing the Constitution, which he has touted while on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. The initiative outlines that it only applies to registered voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and North Carolina, and if they sign the petition.

"The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments," the petition states.

As the campaign enters its final days, Musk has continued rallying support on X, including reminding Pennsylvania voters that Tuesday marked the last day for early in-person voting in the state.

Since Harris emerged as the top presidential candidate for the Democratic ticket in July after President Biden dropped out of the race amid mounting concern over his mental acuity and age, Fox News found the vice president has visited Pennsylvania at least 15 times, as of Tuesday. Philadelphia was where Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and where she prepared for her September Philadelphia debate against Trump.

Trump has also visited the state at least 15 times since the end of July, Fox News found. Trump’s history with Pennsylvania was underscored by an assassination attempt on his life July 13 in Butler, when a man named Mathew Crooks opened fire on Trump and his supporters. Trump was injured on the side of his head by the shooting, and two other rallygoers were also injured. Local man Corey Comperatore died protecting his family during the violence.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has visited the state at least 13 times since the start of August. Walz has visited Pennsylvania at least nine times since August, data compiled by Fox News found.

Pennsylvania carries 19 electoral votes and historically voted for Democratic presidential candidates dating to 1992, until Trump's successful 2016 election. Trump narrowly won the state that year as he campaigned against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

In 2020, however, Biden won the state by 1.17 percentage points​. That year, Democrats had a larger margin of registered voters compared to their Republican counterparts, at 4.2 million to 3.5 million. The data show that Democrats had a registration advantage over Republicans by 685,818 voters during the election that Biden won by 80,555 votes.

The GOP has whittled down that lead this year to a margin of 297,824. When comparing registered voters this election year to 2020, Democrats face a net loss of 257,281 voters, while Republicans have a net gain of 428,537 registered voters.

Mark Cuban has been one of the most vocal critics of Donald Trump in the NBA. But one of his biggest business partners has reportedly made the largest donation to Trump of any owner in American sports.

The family of Miriam Adelson, who bought the majority of the Dallas Mavericks from Cuban in December 2023, has donated $100 million to her Preserve America political action committee backing Trump’s presidential campaign, according to Front Office Sports. That number is the largest political donation of any owner in the NBA, NFL, MLB or WNBA.

Trump was reportedly hoping for much more, according to the New York Times, as the former president was expecting closer to $250 million.

Adelson has also reportedly spent "tens of millions" more to support Republicans in congressional races around the country.

The Adelson family are majority shareholders in Las Vegas Sands, with Patrick Dumont serving as president and chief operating officer of the company. Forbes estimates that Adelson and her family have a net worth of $32.3 billion, making her the 44th-richest person and the fifth-richest woman in the world.

The NBA's Board of Governors approved the sale of the controlling interest in the organization from Mark Cuban to the families in January 2024, for around $3.5 billion. Cuban retained about a quarter of the organization in the sale.

An active supporter of Harris, Cuban has been dedicating much of his own time and nearly his entire presence on social media to advocating for her policies and debating against Trump's with various users. Cuban has gone so far as to follow others in Democrat circles by calling Trump a fascist amid recent mainstream media comparisons of the 45th U.S. president to Adolf Hitler and his supports to that of the Nazis in recent weeks.

"Donald Trump is not a normal candidate," Cuban told Jonathan Karl in a recent ABC interview. "And I think it’s not a stretch to call Donald Trump a fascist.

"He’s talking about the enemy within and going after people using the military. He’s talked about mass deportations where they’ll stop people on the street and check their papers. What does that remind you of? Talking about knocking on doors and pulling people out and deporting them, what does that remind you of? That’s pretty damn close to fascism, if not the definition of fascism."

But despite such vehement rhetoric against the former president, Cuban defended his business relationship with the Trump megadonor in a recent interview on FOX 5 Dallas.

"Do you know how everyone is voting who you work with? Do you know how the owners of your company are voting? This is America. People get to choose their candidates and vote who they want, and that's what makes it amazing," Cuban said. "I've talked with my partners about it, and they don't have an issue. They choose what they choose."

According to public records, Cuban has not given money to political candidates in decades, and he said recently that he hasn’t given Harris "a penny" despite his support.

However, Cuban has gone to very distant lengths in his quest to help prevent Trump from getting elected.

Cuban recently engaged in a multi-thread debate with multiple X users, including 24-year-old former college swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines over criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the southern border.

MARK CUBAN SLAMMED BY KNICKS STAR JALEN BRUNSON OVER COMMENTS ABOUT HIS PARENTS

Cuban, who has been a staunch advocate for Harris, Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has defended the VP's record on the border. Cuban even said he thinks the actions she has taken to reduce the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border "have actually worked" in a recent CNBC interview.

Cuban's defense of Harris and Democrats has ramped up in recent weeks. He has done several interviews endorsing the VP in the upcoming election, making statements that have raised eyebrows from conservative voters. Cuban has suggested Trump is "a socialist" and even said he believes the mainstream media "leans right" in a recent CNBC interview.

Earlier this year, when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was "being given his last rites."

"If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden," Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

However, Cuban has also said he supported Trump at the outset of the former president's first candidacy in 2015.

Cuban has said he supported the former president when Trump initially launched his first presidential campaign in 2015. Cuban elaborated on his initial support of Trump during an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy on X on Aug. 7.

"In 2015, I was like, ‘He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate.' I thought that was a positive," Cuban said. "A big part of that is I didn't think he had a chance. I just wanted to kind of screw things up in traditional politics, which I'm not a fan of."

"I don't care what his actual positions are," Cuban also wrote of Trump in a post on his own social media app project "Cyberdust" in July 2015. "I don't care if he says the wrong thing. He says what's on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years."
Video posted on social media Tuesday shows Democratic Mayor Matt Tuerk of Allentown, Pennsylvania, arguing with a Trump campaign employee near the site of a rally held by former President Donald Trump.

Trump held a rally at the PPL Center in Allentown Tuesday, which was across the street from the Lehigh County Governing Center, where voters were seeking applications for absentee ballots, the Lehigh Valley News reported. The video posted on social media showed Tuerk and the Trump campaign employee arguing over the movement of barricades that blocked traffic. (RELATED: Scott Jennings Doesn’t Buy It When CNN Panelist Spins Biden Calling Trump Supporters ‘Garbage’)

“You said it three times, and then all of a sudden you let the traffic come through and I’m trying to put out barricades while dodging cars at the same time,” the campaign employee told Tuerk.

“Don’t,” the employee continued. “Do you think I’m going to fucking take it off now?”

Tuerk claimed he didn’t want the Trump campaign employee to endanger himself.

“Oh yeah?” The Trump campaign employee responded. “We got cars coming in from all four intersections while I’m in the middle of it!”

Tuerk, who previously described Trump as an “unwelcome guest” in a Sunday post on X that invited people to attend Vice President Kamala Harris’ “closing argument” speech, held up his hands as the Trump campaign employee pointed out that the city put out a press statement about road closures for the rally.

“The Trump-deranged Democrat Mayor of Allentown tried to disrupt the buildout of President Trump’s rally, despite the campaign having proper permitting and approved road closures. We appreciate local law enforcement’s assistance in ensuring the rally was a major success!” Trump Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“You think I’m going to remove the barricades now?” the Trump campaign employee asked Tuerk. “You’re out of your fucking mind! Don’t ever pull that shit on me ever again! The entire police force was confused. Go and call your chief, please.”

The video shows Tuerk making a call on his cell phone as the Trump campaign employee called him out.

“You tried to pull some fake shit over the permits,” the Trump campaign employee said.

Trump’s rally took place as planned on Tuesday. During the event, Trump fired back at President Joe Biden after he called Trump supporters “garbage,” comparing the comments to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” statement, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Trump leads Harris in a head-to-head matchup by 0.6% in polls of Pennsylvania voters from Oct. 2 to Oct. 29, according to the RealClearPolling average. Trump leads or is tied in four of the last five polls in the crucial swing state when independent candidate Cornel West, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are included as options in the surveys.

Tuerk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.

“I’m going to give this kid a raise,” Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign official, posted on X.

Vice President Kamala Harris was forced to do damage control Wednesday after President Joe Biden called supporters of former President Donald Trump “garbage” while she was giving her campaign’s closing argument speech.

While on a get-out-the-vote call hosted by Voto Latino, the president responded to a joke made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe during a Trump rally in which he equated Puerto Rico to “floating island of garbage.” Biden called Trump a “failed businessman” with “no character” before going on to say the only garbage “floating out there is his supporters.” The vice president responded to Biden calling roughly half the country “garbage,” saying he had clarified the remarks and that she did not believe in criticizing people based on who they vote for.

“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.

“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.

The White House attempted to quell outrage over Biden’s comments Tuesday night, posting a written transcript of his comments, modifying “supporters” (as it was understood to many) to “supporter’s,” arguing that the president was addressing Hinchcliffe.

“[Biden] referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage,'” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wrote in a tweet alongside the transcript.

But the response only fueled outrage further as pundits and social media users were quick to question the use of the apostrophe.

My write up: I also asked the WH how they knew Biden only meant “supporter’s” as they have it in this transcript. Did they talk to Biden to ask him what he meant?

The president’s twitter account then put out a statement clarifying what he meant.

“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” a post from the president’s twitter account reads. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”

The firestorm came as Harris was on stage at the Ellipse in the nation’s capital for her closing arguments in her campaign. The vice president attempted to draw on the location of her speech, the last place Trump spoke before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Riot, and the danger the former president poses to the country. Her remarks, in many ways, have been overshadowed by Biden’s comments. (RELATED: Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site)

A reporter followed up Wednesday, asking Harris if she sympathized with Americans who were offended by the president’s comments.

“I am running for president of the United States, I will be traveling to three states today to do what I have been doing throughout, which is talking with the American people about the fact that, first of all, I get it in terms of the concerns they have about challenges like the price of groceries,” Harris responded. “Second, my highest priority is to address that and to lift them up around their ambitions and aspirations and dreams and why I have a plan to strengthen the economy.”
Pollster Frank Luntz said Wednesday on CNN’s “News Central” that President Joe Biden’s garbage comment could have a “huge” impact and might be the “turning point” that leads to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the election.

Luntz said, “It’s going to be huge because this is not some comedian saying something stupid and offensive at a rally where he should have been just basically disinvited. This is the president of the United States endorsing his vice president, saying something — and I know that there’s different interpretations about what he said — it’s still inappropriate. He still shouldn’t be doing it. And I’ve watched Trump already seize this. The ‘basket of deplorables’ was significant, was meaningful in 2016. In 2024, I can promise you that this is going to drive Trump turnout. And he’s doing it already. I can see — I’m sure there’s going to be ads on as soon as tonight about this. This may be a turning point for those final 3% — and that’s all it is — who still need to be persuaded.”

He added, “Focusing on these last persuadables I will tell you that Trump offends them and they don’t like him as a person but Harris scares them because they don’t know where she stands. They feel that she hasn’t been clear on some of the key issues.”

Donald Trump’s rally in New York City’s iconic Madison Square Garden was much more than a campaign event in symbolically hostile territory; it was part of a broader strategy aimed at achieving not only victory but also a resounding national mandate.

At first glance, the decision to hold a high-profile rally in New York — a state Trump has little chance of winning — might seem curious to observers, but it signals the campaign’s confidence.

Tactically, the event in New York City does two things. First, it bolsters Republican House seats in New York won in 2022 due to former Rep. Lee Zeldin’s strong run for governor. Second, because the New York media market extends to Pennsylvania, it nudges the Keystone State further into Trump’s camp.

But Trump is playing a bigger game, seeking to secure both the Electoral College and, for the first time since 2004, a Republican victory in the national popular vote. This dual victory would provide Trump with a mandate strong enough to propel an ambitious second-term agenda and reinforce the Republican position in both the House and Senate.

In today’s turbulent political climate, winning the popular vote has a critical symbolic and practical importance — potentially muting post-election violence from the radical left that some fear.



If Trump not only secures the presidency but also wins over a majority of Americans nationally, he will be uniquely positioned to dispel the manufactured legitimacy concerns designed to drive him from office or, at the very least, hinder his term. The mandate would not only provide Trump with the backing needed to implement his agenda but would also help foster a sense of unity and legitimacy for his administration, which is crucial for national healing in a deeply divided country.

Strategic Importance of the Popular Vote and Senate Majority

In the immediate term, a Trump popular vote win would greatly benefit the GOP by enhancing down-ballot support for Republican candidates. RealClearPolitics’ polling suggests that many key races for the House and Senate are close. With a Trump-led wave, Republicans are positioned not just to hold their majority in the House but also to potentially expand their influence in the Senate.

Such gains would be pivotal: Republicans have a tough Senate map to navigate in 2026, in which they will need to defend more seats than the Democrats. An increase in Senate seats now, perhaps to 54 or even 56, would help safeguard their legislative priorities well beyond 2024, mitigating the typical midterm losses and giving Republicans more time to enact critically needed structural changes.

With a substantial majority in the Senate, Trump would have a far greater capacity to push through high-level appointees and judges. During his first term, Trump found his conservative appointments to the federal judiciary among his most enduring accomplishments, reshaping the courts in a way that will benefit American jurisprudence for decades. A Republican-controlled Senate would allow Trump to continue this transformation, securing appointments to the Supreme Court and federal benches that align with his administration’s originalist philosophy. Additionally, this would make it significantly easier to confirm key administration figures, helping to avoid the roadblocks that slowed his first term.

For Trump, a clear Senate majority represents more than just filling judicial seats. It’s about having the ability to move forward on an ambitious, transformational agenda. Unlike in his previous term, where legislative initiatives often stalled due to opposition or lukewarm support from Congress, a Senate majority offers Trump the potential to address America’s mounting challenges, including the burgeoning federal debt, a rekindled industrial policy, and an intensifying threat from the People’s Republic of China. These issues demand focused and sustained effort, which a Republican-controlled Senate could facilitate across a full four-year term, rather than a truncated two-year window.

Discrediting Corporate Media and the Censorship-Industrial Complex

Alongside a push for both the Electoral College and popular vote wins, Trump is challenging the corporate media and the incestuous partnership it has developed with both the U.S. and foreign governments to censor citizens, shackling the free press. This censorship-industrial complex fuses major media, tech giants, and federal influence to shape public discourse and narratives. For Trump and his supporters, these institutions are seen as obstacles not only to his campaign but also to transparency and trust in American media.

By staging high-profile events outside the conventional media channels, such as his recent marathon three-hour interview with Joe Rogan, Trump is reaching millions of Americans directly. Creeping up on 40 million views in just a few days, the Rogan interview dwarfed Kamala Harris’ recent scripted town hall on CNN, which garnered only 3 million views, and her appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, which reportedly averages about 10 million listeners each episode.

Trump’s ability to bypass traditional media channels and appeal directly to a massive audience is not just about attracting votes; it’s about shifting the public’s understanding of news and information. A second Trump administration, bolstered by a clear mandate from the popular vote, would be in a stronger position to challenge media narratives and push back against media-driven misinformation.

Healing a Divided Nation Through a Strong Mandate

One of the most pressing needs for a second Trump administration is to heal a divided nation. Trump’s critics often point to his brash style as a source of division, yet Trump’s strategy suggests he understands that a strong mandate would give him a better chance at bridging divides. Winning the national popular vote, with significantly increased support from both black and Hispanic Americans, would not only reinforce his legitimacy but could serve as a unifying force. This mandate could give him the political capital to engage in difficult policy efforts.

In this light, Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally takes on added significance. It’s not simply a campaign stop in an unwinnable state; it’s a bid to unify and rally a national coalition.
USA Today became the latest publication to snub Vice President Kamala Harris with a non-endorsement in the 2024 presidential election.

Lark-Marie Antón, a spokesperson for USA Today confirmed to the Daily Beast that the publication had decided not to endorse either Harris or former President Donald Trump in the presidential election, noting that the publication believes “America’s future is decided locally.”

The outlet’s decision to not endorse Harris comes years after it “broke tradition in urging” its readers not to vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and went on to endorse President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, writing that it “unanimously supports the election of Joe Biden.”

“Why are we doing this?” Anton said in a statement. “Because we believe America’s future is decided locally—one race at a time. And with more than 200 publications across the nation, our public service is to provide readers with the facts that matter and the trusted information they need to make informed decisions.”

The Daily Beast noted that USA Today “has a circulation of 132,640 print subscribers and has millions of more readers online,” adding that it was the “flagship brand for over 200 local newspapers” throughout the United States.

Other publications such as the Los Angeles Times, the hometown newspaper of Harris, and the Washington Post have also recently announced that they would not be issuing an endorsement of a presidential candidate in the election.

The LA Times revealed it would not be endorsing a presidential candidate, despite having previously endorsed Biden, former President Barack Obama, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

In an opinion piece, William Lewis, a publisher and chief executive officer for the Post wrote that the publication would “not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate” in this election or “any future presidential election”:

The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.

The non-endorsements of Harris from the news publications come as she has already faced a non-endorsement from the Teamsters Union, which represents over one million union members, despite polling showing that nearly 60 percent of its union members support Trump, while 34 percent support Harris.
On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” MSNBC host Alicia Menendez criticized “the audacity that people are like, well, Kamala Harris needs to tell me more about her plans” when she believes 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is saying he has plans to steal the election with House Speaker Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA).

After host Nicolle Wallace played video of Trump saying, “I think with our little secret, we’re going to do really well with the House, right? Our little secret is having a big impact. He and I have a secret. We’ll tell you what it is when the race is over” and argued that these comments, which were preceded by Trump saying that “We got to get the congressmen elected and we got to get the senators elected, because we can take the Senate pretty easily” is a plot to steal the election with Johnson and Republicans support Trump nonetheless, Menendez said, “[G]enerally, what you talk about on the presidential stump is your plans, the audacity that people are like, well, Kamala Harris needs to tell me more about her plans. And it’s like, he’s telling you that his plans, which he’s supposed to sell to you so he has a popular mandate in order to enact them, is a secret with a guy who has an actually incredibly perilous place within his own caucus, who you are now promising is going to be there, which means you think you’re winning the House, and on top of that, you think that he is going to continue to lead this caucus, even though, at every turn, they have tried to kick him out. It is not a secret. It’s a threat. And we all hear and understand what it is that they’re saying.”

The Kamala Harris presidential campaign has launched a custom map in the megapopular video game Fortnite in a last ditch attempt to reach young men.

Gamerant reports that with the 2024 U.S. presidential election just days away on November 5, the campaigns of both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are ramping up efforts to reach voters, especially the historically low-turnout youth demographic. In the latest example of this trend, the Harris campaign unveiled a Fortnite map called “Freedom Town, USA” on Monday.

The map’s energetic launch trailer, set to the tune of Megan Thee Stallion and BTS member RM’s “Neva Play”, provides an overview of the stage which focuses heavily on exploration. In line with its origins as a political initiative, Freedom Town features an array of slogans and set pieces meant to inspire Fortnite players to vote, including a large-scale Statue of Liberty feeding into the map’s freedom motif.

The Harris campaign is promoting Freedom Town through partner streams with Fortnite content creators like Khairi “Kdot” Harris and Morgan “MODELMORG” Pope. This is not their first foray into gaming to connect with younger voters. Over the final October weekend, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and VP candidate Gov. Tim Walz played Madden NFL 25 live on Twitch while fielding viewer questions.

The Trump campaign has made similar livestreaming outreach efforts, with the former president joining Adin Ross on the Kick streaming platform in early August to discuss politics. Motivating even a small portion of young voters, who have historically low turnout rates, could prove decisive in the 2024 election.

The Tampa Bay Times joined a growing number of news publications in announcing that they would not be endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the publication’s editorial board.

In an opinion article, the outlet revealed that while the Times Editorial Board had made political recommendations for “17 Democrats and 13 Republicans across 30 partisan races,” along with candidates in “six non-partisan contests,” there was not a recommendation for a presidential candidate, adding that they “never planned to”:

The Tampa Bay Times Editorial Board also did not make a recommendation for president. But there’s a big difference: We never planned to. Before the primary and general election cycles, the Times Editorial Board discussed where best to apply our time, listed all the races in which we intended to make recommendations and then published that list on the Times website. That list first appeared in July and then updated again in early October for the general election. The list never included the race for president and dozens of other contests. The decision was made months ago.

The decision from the news publication to not endorse a presidential candidate comes as the publication has previously endorsed President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

In the opinion piece from the Times Editorial Board, the publication added that “no one killed” their “presidential recommendation after it was written,” noting that they “never wrote one”:

Local news organization’s constantly decide how to use resources for the most effect. For the Times Editorial Board, the choice not to make a recommendation for president — and dozens of other races — was one of those decisions. No one told us we couldn’t. No one killed our presidential recommendation after it was written. The fact is, we never wrote one and never intended to.

The publication’s editorial board added they could not “think of a single reader who has told” them “over the past election cycle that they needed” help deciding “how to vote for president.”

The Tampa Bay Times joins publications such as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and USA Today in announcing that they will not endorse either Vice President Harris or former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election.

In response to the publications announcing they would not be endorsing a presidential candidate in the election, readers of the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post have canceled their subscriptions.

Washington Post editor-at-large Robert Kagan also resigned from his role with the publication after the paper’s non-endorsement of Harris.
Former Obama adviser Tommy Vietor expressed concerns Tuesday on his podcast about Vice President Kamala Harris’ closing message on former President Donald Trump, suggesting her labeling him a fascist might alienate undecided swing voters.

Over the past week, corporate media and the Harris campaign have amplified comparisons of Trump to Hitler, following comments from Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly, who told The New York Times and The Atlantic that Trump “met the definition of a fascist” and reportedly admired figures like Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. On “Pod Save America,” Vietor voiced his concern over this messaging, saying the tone has become “mixed,” sounding “partisan and hyperbolic.”

“I’m a little worried about the balance of the moment and not because of the message testing of ads. It’s just because you have to ask yourself what is breaking through in the closing days, and I do think it is primarily this conversation about Trump and fascism,” Vietor said. “I think it’s valuable to say the top people that worked for him don’t trust him to be president again — I think that’s alarming new information, probably for a lot of people. But it’s gotten mixed in with conversations about praising Hitler’s generals and things that I think just sound partisan and hyperbolic, and a lot of people brush it off.”

One of Vietor’s co-hosts then stepped in to defend the Harris campaign’s rhetoric, noting that CNN’s Anderson Cooper had raised the topic of Trump being called a fascist. Vietor clarified that while he wasn’t placing blame on anyone for focusing on the subject, he emphasized that swing voters might be more concerned about the economy than this issue. (WATCH HERE: Cleaning Up Kamala)

“I’m not blaming anyone, I’m talking about the closing conversation that people are hearing, and I think it’s overly tilted away from an economic message right now in ways that worry me. Because every focus group and piece of polling we see shows you that voters primarily care about those issues, and they’re also, there’s a pretty easy, ready-made answer for Trump, which is we saw him for four years, people don’t think it was that bad, and so some of the language used to describe him can seem ridiculous to people. So that’s where my anxiety comes from,” Vietor continued.

WATCH:

“I agree with you, like, I’m not criticizing their strategy necessarily, but you get to decide whether you do a press avail or not, you get to take questions or not, you get to decide how you answer things and what you highlight or not. So it does feel like they are leaning into this,” Vietor added. “There’s a big speech Tuesday at the ellipse where Jan. 6, you know, started, right? That is going to lead to a conversation about the 2020 election and the insurrection and Trump’s fascistic tendencies, and I just, I’m a little worried about that emphasis when a lot of these undecided swing voters are like, ‘I don’t know, but gas was cheaper.'”

Voters have consistently cited the economy, inflation, and immigration as major concerns when deciding who to support in the 2024 election. Trump is trusted by voters over Harris on the economy by 12 points, up from an 8-point lead in August, according to a recent Wall Street Journal poll. The former president also leads Harris on immigration by 15 points, a significant increase from his 7-point lead in August.

Amazon founder and Washington Post owner said Monday that the Post’s decision not to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris is in response to a larger issue of media credibility being eroded.

Bezos pointed to the recent surveys on trust and public reputation, with media institutions consistently ranking near the bottom, in the article titled “The Hard Truth: Americans Don’t Trust the News Media,” published in the opinion section of the Post. This year, however, Gallup reports an even more dire verdict that journalism now holds the lowest spot in American trust, with Bezos arguing media credibility has eroded not only because of perceived biases but also due to an industry tendency to ignore public perception.

Bezos further explained that the most recent backlash surrounding the Post’s decision not to endorse Harris only highlights a growing issue that trust in the press depends on two pillars — the coverage being accurate, and it must be broadly trusted to be accurate. The choice not to endorse provoked outrage across liberal circles, but as Bezos stated in a rare public response, the decision is rooted not in partisanship but in a commitment to genuine independence.

🚨BREAKING: Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos speaks out after his paper refused to endorse Kamala Harris for President “The hard truth: Americans don’t trust the news media” pic.twitter.com/3Dl8OaY4kj — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) October 29, 2024

“Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, ‘I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.’ None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one,” Bezos wrote.

Bezos acknowledged that this choice might appear strategically timed to favor one candidate over another, especially given a coincidental meeting between a top executive from Blue Origin, a company which Bezos also owns, and former President Donald Trump on the same day. (RELATED: ‘An Absolute Wimping Out’: Fox News Guest Roasts WaPo Decision To Sit Out Election)

“I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here. Neither campaign nor candidate was consulted or informed at any level or in any way about this decision,” he wrote to clarify that the decision was made internally.

Even so, Bezos is acutely aware of the larger challenges facing his newspaper and the industry at large, as the media’s credibility problem is neither isolated nor new. “Increasingly, we talk only to a certain elite,” Bezos reflected, contrasting today’s diminished public reach to the 80% household penetration WaPo achieved in the D.C. metro area during the 1990s.

“Now more than ever the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world? To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles,” Bezos added.

WaPo reportedly saw a drop of over 200,000 subscriptions after CEO and Publisher William Lewis announced that, for the first time in decades, the paper’s editorial board will not endorse a presidential candidate, NPR reported. Following the decision, several staff members who supported Harris reportedly resigned in protest.

Ohio-based journalist Ray Marcano said Monday evening on a livestream that Democratic “outrage” over former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden missed the point on the appeal of certain comments.

Thousands of Trump supporters gathered in New York City on Sunday, selling out Madison Square Garden to see the former president and a lineup of Republican icons, including businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson. On “2Way TONIGHT,” host Mark Halperin introduced Marcano to the panel, asking his thoughts on Trump’s campaign with less than 10 days until Election Day.

“I actually think the rally on [Sunday] was arguably the high point of his campaign. I’ve actually been amused by how the mainstream media has covered this. This was Trump in concert, and he won the day — which is everything he wants to do,” Marcano said.

“The outrage over the Tony Hinchcliffe Puerto Rico joke misses the point because Hinchcliffe, if you know his work, he pushes boundaries and he’s given the middle finger to left by telling the woke crowd, ‘I’ll say whatever I want to say in my concert performances, and you can’t touch me,'” Marcano added. “And that’s a message that resonates with a lot of people, especially in the bro culture.”

Following the Madison Square Garden rally, fellow guest and comedian Tony Hinchcliffe faced significant backlash from corporate media and Democrats over his joke comparing Puerto Rico to a “floating island of garbage.” (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Rips Party Of ‘Single Most Useless People’ In America, Declares Trump Is ‘Gonna Win’)

Marcano went on to say that the media’s portrayal of Trump’s campaign as appealing primarily to “the white working class” is inaccurate, suggesting that the former president may have the “most diverse base” this election cycle.

WATCH:

“Lastly, the media keeps writing that this is Trump appealing to the white working class, worried about their future in the American society that’s starting to [become] increasingly brown. What that really misses is the biggest point, and that is Trump is building, for a Republican presidential candidate, the most diverse base, the most diverse group of voters of any Republican candidate in history,” Marcano continued.

“He’s going to get 15% of the black vote at least, if he gets that much, Harris is sunk. It looks like he’s going to get as many women votes as he did in 2020,” Marcano said. “He’s going to get 40% of the Hispanic vote. I don’t want Trump to win, I don’t think he’d be good for America, good for the world, good for anybody. But if this were a football game, he’s in the red zone.”

Since early October, pundits have warned of Trump pulling support from Harris’ key voting blocs, particularly Hispanic and black men. In efforts to appeal to these groups, Harris’ campaign has released targeted ads, created specific policies, and enlisted former President Barack Obama to engage voters.

However, following Obama’s first rally in Pennsylvania with the vice president, he faced backlash for scolding undecided voters, especially black men. Harris’ ad aimed at men also received criticism for its focus on so-called “real men.”

On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” New York Times National Politics Reporter and CNN Political Analyst Astead Herndon stated that while Democrats can put out policies to say they’re different from President Joe Biden, “they spent two years defending Joe Biden and kind of defending a status quo administration that’s really unpopular.”

After host Anderson Cooper said that it isn’t as though 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump has tons of plans while Harris has none and CNN Senior Political Commentator and former Obama adviser David Axelrod argued Harris has put out more plans, Herndon said, “I somewhat think the plans discussion is too small, though, for Harris’ big problem in this race. I think if Democrats have a challenge they have to overcome, it’s that they are tied to the status quo in what feels like a change election. You can put out policies to kind of project how you’re different than that. But I think the biggest thing that is really weighing them down on that question, was they spent two years defending Joe Biden and kind of defending a status quo administration that’s really unpopular. And so, they are still playing catch-up on the new way forward question. That is the litmus test that she laid out for herself in those interviews.”

Herndon added that it does depend if voters want change from Biden or Trump’s politics.

The 2024 election cycle has been marked by Democrats’ attempts to rig the election in their favor, much like they did four years ago. Yet despite left-wing control of government institutions that run elections and a media dedicated to Democrat victory, these largely unsuccessful attempts reek of desperation as we get closer to Nov. 5.

Noncitizens and the Justice Department

Democrats and their media allies have for months been pushing the false claim that noncitizens registering to vote or voting in U.S. elections is a made-up problem, running story after story suggesting that the phenomenon is not really occurring at any significant level, despite evidence to the contrary.

As The Federalist has reported, thousands of noncitizens have made their way onto voter rolls across the country. As Republicans made headway in protecting U.S. elections from noncitizen interference, Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration went from insisting noncitizen voting doesn’t happen to opposing these election integrity efforts in multiple states, essentially working to keep noncitizens on the voter rolls ahead of the 2024 election.

For example, the Biden-Harris Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Virginia earlier this month alleging that the state’s efforts to remove foreign nationals from its voter lists ahead of the 2024 election were illegal. On Friday, a Democrat-appointed federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate 1,500 allegedly “self-identified” noncitizens onto the voter rolls, as The Federalist reported, and a Biden and Obama-appointed three-judge panel upheld the decision Sunday. The state is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn those decisions and allow the commonwealth to remove the “self-identified” foreign nationals from the rolls.

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act introduced earlier this year would have amended federal election law to require individuals to present documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections, but 14 Republicans joined most House Democrats in ultimately killing the bill less than two months before Election Day.

Corporate Media and the Censorship Regime

The corporate media enablers of Democrat efforts to lie to the American people, cover up true information, and play defense for the Harris campaign have been in full swing this season, maybe even more so than in 2020.

In its most recent frenzied attempt to help advance the Democrat agenda, the propaganda press is breathlessly comparing Trump’s Sunday Madison Square Garden rally to a Nazi gathering. This came less than a week after propagandist Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, published a fabricated hit piece about Trump’s dealings with a Gold Star family. The piece also showcased heavily debunked allegations from former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly who claimed that Trump once wished for “the kind of generals that Hitler had.”

Like clockwork, Harris peddled these claims to the American people from the steps of her official Washington, D.C. residence last week, perpetuating the type of rhetoric that has already led to two assassination attempts against the former president and current Republican nominee.

Left-wing outlets were also key in staging a palace coup against Biden after his dismal debate performance against Trump in June. Once they got their replacement candidate in Harris, they rigged her only debate against Trump in which the ABC News moderators conducted a “criminally biased” show, “practically amounting to an in-kind donation to the Harris campaign,” as The Federalist’s John Daniel Davidson wrote.

After installing Harris, the corporate media also allowed the nominee to go months without sitting down for interviews or press conferences, apart from those with conveniently friendly and negligent interviewers.

One of the most egregious examples of the propaganda press running cover for Harris came when CBS News apparently selectively edited her “60 Minutes” interview with Bill Whitaker, making Harris appear more articulate than she actually was. The move raised questions about potential media coordination with the Harris campaign and the apparent attempt to hide the nominee’s incoherence from the American people.

While outlets slavishly work to deceive Americans in favor of a Harris win in 2024, congressional Democrats have likewise been calling for censorship by demanding that Big Tech conglomerates, much like they did in 2020, stop people from sharing information on social media and other platforms. And Big Tech seems willing to comply; just this week, YouTube kept podcaster Joe Rogan’s major interview with Trump out of search results.

Lawfare

Another set of people trying their best to rig the election are the multiple, openly left-wing prosecutors and judges hellbent on jailing the former president and current Republican nominee.

While Democrats’ first move was to try removing Trump from the ballots, they quickly turned to lawfare against the former president after those attempts failed. They have, however, been active in trying to remove or keep third-party candidates, like Cornel West or Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., on ballots in swing states, in an effort to help Kamala Harris’ chances of winning.

Charges in several states and the District of Columbia have been brought against Trump by left-wing prosecutors and Biden’s Department of Justice. At the behest of a Democrat judge earlier this year, a slanted and coached Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg — who campaigned on “go[ing] after the former president.“

But perhaps the most prominent lawfare case in terms of election interference is the pursuit of special counsel Jack Smith and his colleagues in the Biden-Harris Justice Department to strip Trump of his First Amendment rights in the Jan. 6 case.

On Oct. 2, Smith released a 165-brief full of negative claims about Trump — as absentee ballots were already circulating the country. As The Federalist reported, such a move weeks before the election was designed to exact “maximum political damage to a Republican presidential candidate.”

Despite the fact that much of the information in Smith’s new brief was just regurgitated “old news” the media machine treated it as brand new, pumping out headline after headline about the so-called “damning details.”

The Jan. 6 charges are before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee who has given Smith every latitude to stay the course, including by unsealing heavily redacted “evidence” brought by Smith against Trump earlier this month. Although the “evidence” did not substantiate Smith’s tired claim in the case, Chutkan released it less than three weeks before Election Day.

Six large public unions have funneled tens of millions of dollars, much of which came from taxpayer-funded dues payments, into aiding Democrats in their bid for power this election cycle.

A handful of large public-sector unions pumped well over $60 million into political organizations, with the lion’s share going toward helping Democrats win races at every level of government, according to the latest set of campaign finance disclosures.

The Daily Caller News Foundation included the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) in its analysis of campaign finance records. In 2020, these six labor organizations were the top political contributors among unions representing public sector employees, according to OpenSecrets.

Unions are legally prohibited from contributing membership dues directly to federal political campaigns, according to the Department of Labor. They can, however, donate revenue derived from membership dues to super PACs and 501(c)(4) advocacy organizations, both of which often work to elect candidates. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)

Indeed, some of the committees that received the most money from public sector unions were super PACs aimed at delivering legislative majorities and the White House to Democrats.

The House and Senate Majority PACs, committees working to elect Democrats to the upper and lower chambers of Congress, collectively pulled in about $15 million from public unions, according to campaign finance records. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which play similar roles, brought in just over $1 million from public-sector union PACs. Future Forward, the primary organization focused on delivering the White House to Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, took in $3 million from public unions.

“Obviously, if you have government employees who are working, you are going to pay them,” Capital Research Center research director Michael Watson, an organized labor expert, told the DCNF. “If you then, on top of that, enact collective bargaining, their salaries that were paid for with taxpayer money are going to go to the union which is going to do union stuff, part of which is supporting liberal candidates.”

Watson went on to explain that taxpayers aren’t just seeing their tax dollars going to support partisan Democrats, but that those donations are also leading to officials being elected who then direct more public funds into union coffers.

“The double whammy is that those liberal politicians that the union is sending money to support, if they win, are then going to be negotiating with the unions,” Watson continued.

President Joe Biden, for instance, transferred $36 billion worth of public funds to bolster a union pension pool in December 2022, The Associated Press reported. The Biden-Harris administration is also pushing student loan debt forgiveness, a policy nonpartisan government analysts say could cost the public but is celebrated by public sector unions as a boon for their members.

Watson pointed to Democratic Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a former union organizer, as a prime example of the taxpayer funds going through the cycle of being used by unions to support liberal politicians who then advocate for more taxpayer funds to flow to unions, thus expanding the amount organized labor can spend on political advocacy to reap even more rewards. Johnson is pushing against much of the city government to take out a $300 million loan to give Chicago teachers, who make an average of $93,000 per year, a 9% raise, The Economist reported.

The mayor’s push for increased teacher pay comes as the city’s public schools faced a half-billion-dollar deficit coming into this school year. The national SIEU and AFT, the second-largest teachers union in the country, collectively gave Johnson over $2.5 million this election cycle, federal campaign finance records show.

Other PACs that raked in considerable funding from public sector unions include pro-abortion committees like EMILY’s List, major liberal committees affiliated with American Bridge and Priorities USA as well as climate-focused organizations, disclosures show. The SEIU, AFT and NALC also put roughly $1.8 million into one of the committees that helped put on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

The NALC stood out from the rest of the unions in that, even though most of its political donations went to Democratic-aligned PACs, it made some contributions to right-leaning committees. PACs like the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican Mainstreet Partnership and Republican Kentucky Rep. James Comer’s leadership PAC collectively brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NALC.

“What some unions, I think you’re seeing it more now with the Teamsters under their new leadership with Sean O’Brien and I think with what may be the case with the letter carriers, is that they are behaving more like a traditional special interest group,” Watson told the DCNF. “What the Teamsters under O’Brien and the letter carriers for a long time have been is ‘look, if you cover us on the issues that matter to us … if you’re scratching our back, we’ll scratch yours even if we don’t agree on any other policies.'”

Watson said the letter carriers are likely concerned with federal postal funding.

Of the funds not donated to explicitly Democratic committees, much of them went to other union political committees, which tend to spend primarily on supporting liberal candidates, disclosures show. Labor organizations can also internally spend funds on political activities, which means the full extent of public union political spending isn’t contained in records maintained by the FEC. The SEIU, NEA, AFT and AFSCME, for instance, launched a joint canvassing effort on Oct. 21 aimed at increasing voter turnout in swing states to support the Harris-Walz ticket, according to a press release.

“Every election cycle, union bosses flood the American political system with billions of dollars to push forward a radical political agenda that boosts union officials’ power over workers, and is directly contrary to the priorities and interests of millions of the members union bosses claim to ‘represent,'” National Right to Work Committee president Mark Mix told the DCNF. “This corrupt cycle of forced dues-funded political influence is especially egregious when it comes to government union bosses, who siphon dues out of taxpayer-funded salaries and use the money to elect politicians who are more loyal to their union backers than the voters they are supposed to represent. This doesn’t just harm taxpayers and voters who see bloated budgets and unaccountable elected officials, but also undermines the individual rights of government employees who are forced to accept unions’ monopoly ‘representation’ despite deep personal or ideological objections to union boss-advocated positions.”

The SEIU, NEA, AFT, AFGE, AFSCME and NALC did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

Former President Donald Trump unveiled a new proposal on Tuesday, pledging to establish a “compensation fund” for victims of migrant crime in the United States.

Speaking to the public during a press conference at Mar-a-Largo, Trump highlighted the growing threat of Tren de Aragua and other international crime syndicates being imported into the U.S. through mass illegal immigration. The Republican candidate pledged to dismantle these migrant gangs and use their seized assets to create a compensation fund for the victims of their crimes. (RELATED: NYPD Refused Detainer Request And Released Illegal Migrant Charged With Attempted Murder, ICE Says)

“Today, I’m announcing that for the first time, under my administration, we will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels, and we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime,” Trump said. “And the government will help in the restitution.”

“But something has to be done, and we’re going to get it done,” he continued.

The campaign pledge came as the presidential election reaches its final days, and border security has remained a top issue for voters.

There were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden-Harris White House, according to the latest data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023.

The wave of illegal immigration has been followed by growing reports of criminal activity by Tren de Aragua, an international gang that originated in Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspects that roughly 600 individuals in the U.S. could have potential ties to the Venezuelan gang, but experts predict that number is likely much higher.

The murders of Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Laken Riley are high-profile examples of numerous victims, allegedly at the hands of illegal migrants, in recent times. Their cases have not only kept border security on the forefront of public debate, but have spawned new laws or legislative proposals across the country.

Trump, who has long championed immigration enforcement, has continued to make the issue a hallmark of his campaign.

[Vice President Kamala Harris’] borders are the worst in the history of the world,” Trump said at his Tuesday press conference. “There’s never been a border in the world like this.”

“It’s at a level that we’ve never seen before,” he continued. “If you look at Venezuela, their crime is way, way down, and you go to Caracas and you wouldn’t recognize it … because they are taking all their criminals — they’re all coming — they’ve taken their drug dealers and put them into the United States.”

Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump is exacting revenge on a House GOP lawmaker who voted to impeach him nearly four years ago.

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., is one of only two House Republicans left in Congress out of the original 10 who defied their party and voted with Democrats after the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

"Newhouse has to go! He wished he didn’t do what he did, but it’s too late," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Tuesday morning, just a week before Election Day.

CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION

Trump also emphasized his support for Newhouse's rival. "Jerrod Sessler is a fantastic Candidate and will be a GREAT Congressman for Washington State’s 4th Congressional District."

"He is running against a Weak and Pathetic RINO named Newhouse, who voted to, for no reason, Impeach me," Trump wrote.

Sessler, a Navy veteran, is challenging Newhouse for Washington's 4th Congressional District. In addition to Trump, he is also backed by the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS ‘LACK OF LEADERSHIP’ IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

Newhouse is seeking a sixth term representing what is the reddest district in Washington state, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

He came second to Sessler in the state's primary elections over the summer. Washington's primaries do not operate on a party-based system – instead, the top-two candidates in the race advance to the general election.

Newhouse told the Yakima Herald-Republic last week that he did not believe his vote to impeach Trump would prevent him from working well with the ex-president if he wins the White House again.

"I worked very closely and successfully with President Trump and his first administration and I feel very confident that I can do that again," he said.

He acknowledged the impeachment vote as "the elephant in the room" but said, "We really don't think that would be a factor."

Newhouse won re-election in 2022 against a Democratic challenger by a rough margin of 68% to 32%.

His campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Trump originally endorsed Sessler and Republican Tiffany Smiley in the district's primary earlier this year in a bid to force Newhouse out. Sessler finished first, while Smiley was eliminated after finishing third.
FIRST ON FOX: The mother of a woman who was allegedly killed by a Salvadoran illegal immigrant has written to Vice President Kamala Harris calling on her to "take immediate action" to close the border and require the removal of millions of illegal immigrants.

"I demand that you take immediate action today and sign an executive order closing our southern border. Furthermore, require every single person who has entered our country illegally over the past three and half years to return to their home countries," Patty Morin says in a letter to Harris, first obtained by Fox News Digital.

"The time for decisive action is now. This is about protecting our citizens and ensuring that the immigrants who come to America are here to contribute to our great society."

‘OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING’: RACHEL MORIN'S MOM SOUNDS ALARM ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AFTER DAUGHTER'S MURDER

Morin’s daughter Rachel was killed while jogging in Bel Air, Maryland, last year. Police found Rachel’s body stuffed in a culvert and, after a months-long investigation, identified her suspected killer as an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who is also accused of murder in his home country and raping a mother and her 9-year-old daughter in Los Angeles.

He made three unsuccessful attempts to enter the United States before making it across the border on Feb. 13, 2023, near El Paso, Texas, authorities said.

The case is one of a number of high-profile crimes involving illegal immigrants, drawing additional attention to the ongoing effects of the crisis at the southern border, which saw record numbers come into the U.S. under the Biden administration. Critics blame the crisis on the policies of the administration.

In her letter, Morin described Rachel as a "bright light, an American mom who adored her family and devoted her life to her five children."

"While we can’t bring Rachel back, we can protect other American women, children, and families. This type of violence perpetrated by illegal immigrants can easily be prevented," she says, also reading the letter in a video.

In her letter, she tells Harris that she has "the opportunity to act now and save lives."

"The American people are watching and will remember if this opportunity for change is met with silence or indifference," she says.

TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE SHREDS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN ON BORDER CRISIS IN NEW REPORT: ‘ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW’

Immigration and border security is a top issue in the 2024 election, and polling shows former President Trump leading Harris on the issue among voters.

Trump has promised to restart border wall construction, which was halted by the Biden administration, and launch a mass deportation program if elected to the White House.

Harris has thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would increase funding to the border and limit some entries into the U.S. She has hammered Trump for not supporting it, accusing him of torpedoing the bill for political purposes. She has promised to sign the bill if elected to the White House.

Conservatives have said the bill would enshrine high levels of illegal immigration, and have instead pushed legislation passed in the House last year that would also increase funding but would drastically limit asylum and end the use of parole by the administration.

While the administration has overseen a record number of border encounters, it has recently pointed to a sharp drop by more than 55% since the summer to a presidential proclamation signed by President Biden that limited asylum claims into the country, bringing numbers down to levels not seen since 2020.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik claimed that the FBI is "covering up" Iranian election interference to "tip the scales" for Democrats.

Stefanik, a Republican, told Fox News Digital the FBI has been stonewalling her "very basic, easy" questions about the bureau’s knowledge of the Iran-linked hack of the Trump campaign in which data was then peddled to the Biden campaign and mainstream media news outlets.

"I believe there was politicization from the Biden-Kamala Harris administration that they were notified prior to the Trump campaign to tip the scales," she claimed. "The FBI has functioned like an arm of the Democrat Party."

The Trump campaign claimed in August it was hacked by Iran. In September, the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed that Iran had hacked the campaign and indicted three Iranian nationals for their alleged role in the scheme.

On Sept. 19, the FBI conducted a closed briefing with Stefanik and other members of the Intelligence Committee on foreign election interference. During the briefing, Stefanik claimed FBI officials appeared "panicked" when she questioned them, but promised to follow up with answers.

After the briefing, Stefanik wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding answers by Oct. 7.

The FBI then said it would deliver answers at an in-person briefing, according to Stefanik. Then they promised written answers — which never came.



Stefanik has been demanding to know when and how the FBI learned of the Iranian hack of the Trump campaign, when the FBI notified both campaigns of the hack, whether the FBI knew who was responsible for peddling the information to the media and the Biden or Harris campaigns and whether the FBI had used Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap conversations related to the hack.

TRUMP, STEFANIK CAMPAIGN FOR VULNERABLE NY REPUBLICANS AS BIG APPLE KICKS OFF EARLY VOTING

The hackers had created fake email accounts and impersonated current or former U.S. officials and then duped Trump campaign staff using spear phishing into clicking on emails that reportedly contained malware.

She said the FBI could reveal such information without impeding any investigations or revealing sources or classified information.

"I'm one of the longest serving members on House Intelligence Committee. When the FBI won't answer questions, it's because you've hit on something and they're hiding something. They are corrupt to the core."

The FBI said it had "vigorously" called out Iranian election interference and briefed multiple committees in Congress with jurisdiction on the threats.

"The FBI under Director [Christopher] Wray has vigorously and repeatedly called out the threat posed by Iran. The FBI does not play in partisan politics and has proactively informed victims of the threats posed by this regime while also publicly bringing attention to their actions," the FBI said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

"The FBI has also briefed dozens of members of Congress across multiple committees in both open and classified briefings and hearings. It is no secret how active the FBI has been in countering actions by Iran as evidenced by the recent indictment of Iranian cyber actors linked to a hack-and-leak operation designed to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election."

Stefanik also raised the issue in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal.

"It is my duty to share with the American people what the FBI has failed to answer—and, I believe, is willfully covering up—about Iranian influence in the 2024 presidential election."

Numerous intelligence reports have revealed that U.S. foes like Iran, Russia and China have made efforts to meddle in the November election.

In September, Trump’s campaign said that intelligence officials warned the Republican candidate of " real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him."

A report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), released Tuesday, found that "efforts by Iran to assassinate former President Donald Trump and other former U.S. officials" are "likely to persist after voting ends, regardless of outcome."

The report definitively said that Iran prefers Vice President Kamala Harris and will focus efforts on stopping Trump, and that Russia prefers Trump and will continue to attack Harris.

Last week, Iran built a fake online persona known as "Bushnell's Men," calling on U.S. voters to sit out the election due to both candidates' support of Israel's military operations, the report found.

Both Trump and his high-level officials who ordered the strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani in 2020 have faced death threats from Iran.

After the initial briefing, Stefanik demanded to know when and how the FBI learned of the Iranian hack of the Trump campaign, when the FBI notified both campaigns of the hack, whether the FBI knew who was responsible for peddling the information to the media and the Biden or Harris campaigns and whether the FBI had used Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap conversations related to the hack.
Shortly after the Justice Department objected to, and a federal judge blocked Virginia from removing thousands of ineligible voters from its rolls, a conservative good-government group announced a lawsuit to compel document production from a similar case in the home state of Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.

While attorneys for the Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project said they are chiefly pursuing the documents as a matter of public interest and following a similar request from the Republican National Committee, the parallels between Virginia and Minnesota’s cases cannot be ignored.

The Oversight Project’s lawsuit seeks to compel Minnesota’s Department of State and Department of Public Safety to produce records related to voter roll maintenance.

In September, the public safety department informed lawmakers it had worked with the state department to inactivate 1,000 voters during a manual review of 104,000 total Minnesotans.

DOJ PREVIOUSLY PRE-CLEARED LAW AT CENTER OF YOUNGKIN VOTER ROLL CULLING ORDER

After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an order laying out the culling of essentially self-identified ineligible voters under a 2006 law from then-Democratic Gov. Timothy Kaine, the feds balked and Biden-appointed Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ordered the reinstatement of all voters removed from the rolls under the order.

On Sunday, the Fourth Circuit upheld the ruling and officials in Richmond signaled they wanted the Supreme Court to weigh in.

"Let’s be clear about what just happened: only 11 days before a presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals – who self-identified themselves as noncitizens – back onto the voter rolls," Youngkin said in a statement Friday.

Comparing his case to the situation in Richmond, Oversight Project chief counsel Kyle Brosnan said that while the "Biden-Harris administration has brought ridiculous lawsuits against Alabama and Virginia for their voter roll maintenance efforts, which removed thousands of noncitizens from the voter rolls, the Justice Department is curiously uninterested in Minnesota’s voter roll maintenance efforts. We will continue fighting for transparency on this important election integrity issue."

Brosnan added that Minnesota had not responded to its original request via the state version of the federal FOIA statute, prompting legal action.

APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST VIRGINIA'S EFFORT TO BLOCK REINSTATEMENT OF SUSPECTED NONCITIZENS ON BORDER ROLLS

Asked about the NVRA exception given to Minnesota and other states, there are still multiple other reasons why the public should be apprised of the communications behind the Minnesota case, including the overall issue of proper voter roll maintenance.

"At the core of it, you still have the Justice Department bringing an action against a state like Virginia that removes noncitizens from its ballot. And you have here a situation where noncitizens were potentially automatically registered to vote through the DMV in Minnesota.

"You can find a statutory provision to prevent noncitizens from voting."

Additionally, Brosnan said an automatic registration provision at the state DMV likely led to these ineligible voters being added to the rolls in the first place – prompting public interest in the situation regardless of its comparisons with Virginia’s controversy.

"These offices had brought to the secretary of state’s office’s attention that noncitizens were automatically registered through the DMV… and we filed an open-records request to get the actual number and look at why that occurred."

"You have this in the context of a wide-open border with 10 million illegal aliens flowing through under the current administration," adding that Virginia’s case is proof that many ineligible voters are able to "slip through the cracks" of the safeguards to the voter registration process.

In a 2023 interview following Walz’s signing of the "Democracy for the People Act," Secretary of State Steve Simon spoke to Minnesota's MPR News about the law and was asked about the risk of "undocumented people" ending up on the rolls.

"It’s a very sensible question," the Democratic official said, explaining the Department of Public Safety has experience in the field, and that, "what that means is that no one will even be put in the pile that could possibly be automatically registered."

"You won’t even go into that pile, unless there has been some demonstration of U.S. citizenship."

Brosnan, joined by attorney Neal Cornett, added of the Virginia case that the Justice Department – as any other observer – should find the idea of removing ineligible voters a good thing in terms of "sanctity of the ballot."

While Virginia has gone Democratic in federal elections, geographically, it is a 500-plus mile expanse of relatively conservative areas emanating from Democratic strongholds in Arlington-Fairfax, Norfolk, Winchester, Roanoke and Richmond.

Brosnan noted that, in September, an RNC official sought information from Simon’s office about its Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) system.

The general counsels for Simon’s office and that of the Department of Public Safety responded in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital in which they said individuals may only be registered through AVR if they had provided "citizenship-affirming documentation" at the time of their DMV registration. The process appears similar in Virginia.

The letter said the state completed a manual review of 103,986 records on Sept. 10 and that 1,485 records "that should not have been sent… to be registered through AVR."

"This is either because their documentation was unreadable due to poor scanning quality, missing required information, mislabel[ing] as citizenship-affirming when it was not or unable to be validated for other reasons."

The attorneys wrote that the only statewide election to be conducted under the law was the August 2024 primary, where the secretary of state’s office found no evidence of an ineligible person voting.

Simon’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris by three-points nationally, according to a recent poll.

An AtlasIntel poll, conducted between October 25-29, 2024 of 3,032 likely voters, found that Trump was leading with 49.5 percent of support, while Harris received 47 percent of support.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 0.8 percent of support.

In a head-to-head race between Harris and Trump, 49.8 percent of likely voters expressed support for Trump, while 48.1 percent expressed support for Harris.

When asked which candidate they rejected “more,” 50.1 percent said Harris, while 48.6 percent said Trump.

The results of the AtlasIntell poll come as a New York Times/Siena College national poll found that Trump held a one-point lead over Harris, 47 percent to 46 percent.

Breitbart News’s Wendell Husebo has previously reported that early voting numbers, especially in swing states seem to be in “favor of” Trump.

Early vote trends in swing states favor of former President Donald Trump and suggest “the election will be over on election day before we know who votes,” political analyst Mark Halperin said Tuesday on The Morning Meeting.

In an Economist/YouGov survey, 39 percent of respondents expressed the belief that Trump would win, while 36 percent said they believed that Harris would win the election, and 25 percent of respondents said they were “not sure” which candidate would win.
Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly won Nickelodeon’s non-scientific “Kids Pick the President” poll at 52 percent to former President Donald Trump’s 48 percent.

While the mock presidential election has accurately predicted the winner — except for 2004 and 2016 — the kids favored their 2004 and 2016 losing candidates at a significantly higher percentage than they favored Harris for the 2024 election.

In 2004, kids favored Democrat John Kerry at 57 percent, to former President George W. Bush at 43 precent. In 2016, former First Lady Hillary Clinton pulled in 53 percent of the vote compared with Trump who raked in 36 percent.

This year, Trump was favored at a remarkably higher percentage than he was in 2016. The 45th president was pulled in 48 percent of the vote, with Harris narrowly taking the lead at 52 percent.

The 2024 Nickelodeon’s kids poll also has Harris winning with the lowest percentage difference since poll results for the 2008 election, which saw former President Barack Obama winning with 51 percent compared with former Senator John McCain’s 49 percent.

Nickelodeon has also emphasized that its “Kids Pick the President” poll — which has been conducted for every election starting in 1988 — is “an informal non-scientific poll, meant for entertainment purposes only,” according to a report by TheWrap.

This year, over 32,000 kids cast their virtual vote in Nickelodeon’s poll, which was open from October 3 to 23.

The Harris-Walz campaign is reportedly manipulating the social media platform Reddit and breaking the rules in order to control the narrative on the site and make Vice President Kamala Harris appear more popular than she actually is, according to a new investigation by the Federalist.

While Reddit is a notoriously leftist platform infamous for its censorship of a large community of Trump supporters, Harris’s campaign is deploying its staffers to manipulate the site’s algorithm even further via a massive “astroturfing” operation, which is in direct violation of platform’s Terms of Service, according to a report by the Federalist.

The term “astroturfing” refers to a fake grassroots campaign, which involves campaign staffers or volunteers posing as ordinary people to create the illusion that there is more support being expressed in favor of a particular candidate or issue than there actually is.

“It’s no different than a shady company paying a team to write a bunch of fake Amazon reviews about their product to make it appear to be a better and more popular product than it is,” the Federalist noted.

When this strategy is used on Amazon, it can manipulate people to buy certain products, thinking they are more popular than they are. When the same strategy is deployed for elections, it can reward a falsely advertised candidate with more votes.

The Harris-Walz campaign reportedly keeps a spreadsheet to track of its astroturfing efforts, which involves staffers spamming the “Politics” subreddit (reddit forums on a particular topic) — and other subreddits — with pro-Harris propaganda, and then having volunteers who pretend to be random users who just so happened to stumble upon the content post favorable comments.

The Federalist accessed the campaign’s Discord server and found that every weekday morning paid Democrat staffer Gabrielle Lynn communicates a “Daily Messaging Guidance” for Reddit, which usually consists of articles and data that the Harris-Walz campaign wants to boost, and “key messaging” that campaign volunteers need to stick to.

This information is assembled by official Harris-Walz staffers and is added to a Google Spreadsheet titled “Reddit Organizing.” From there, volunteers called “Lead Posters” — who are Reddit savvy — choose what they think will best resonate with users on the platform.

After posting to Reddit, the campaign’s Lead Posters then go back to the spreadsheet and update it with links to their posts, so that campaign volunteers can then spam the posts with likes and comments, making them appear more active, which then triggers the site’s algorithm to make the content more visible to users.

Harris-Walz campaign volunteers are reportedly working with a database of more than 100 subreddits that they target with campaign propaganda.

“Kamala’s posters, however, don’t simply spam links haphazardly. They use a calculated, sequential post timing metric to avoid Reddit’s built-in spam filters,” the Federalist reported.

Given that this activity violates Reddit’s Terms of Service, Harris-Walz campaign volunteers often discuss how to avoid getting banned while they spam the platform and carry out their astroturfing agenda, according to internal Discord chats obtained by the Federalist.

With regards to how effective this shady strategy has been, the Federalist noted that the Harris-Walz campaign’s own data reveals that over the course of 15 days, its volunteers were able to make 2,551 posts to Reddit, which have so far garnered more than 5.7 million upvotes and 418,000 comments.

Staffers and volunteers posing as regular individuals and spamming Reddit with propaganda and false favorability is clearly an effort by the Harris-Walz campaign to manipulate votes in the 2024 presidential election.

One of the largest super PACs backing Vice President Kamala Harris is targeting large black urban areas in swing-state cities with “creepy,” deceptive, and intimidating ads that ominously warn: your voting history is public and accessible to “friends, family, and neighbors.”

Future Forward, a super PAC supporting the Harris-Walz ticket, has launched an ad campaign in cities with large black populations, emphasizing that voter records indicating if individuals voted are public and easily accessible to community members.

The ads, which are being aired heavily in major swing-state cities like Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, have raised eyebrows for their intimidating and quasi-official presentation.

One ad opens with a bold “election alert,” declaring in a stern and authoritative voice, “Who you vote for is private, but if you vote is public information.”

“After this election, your voter record will be updated, and your friends and family will be able to see how often you vote,” it continues, demanding viewers “do your civic duty” by voting.

Behind the text is an emblem reminiscent of an official government seal, which reads “National Voter Report,” giving the appearance of an official advisory.

﻿ ﻿ ﻿

Another ad explains that while “who you vote for is secret,” but “whether you vote is public information.”

“Your friends, family, and neighbors can look up your voting records,” it warns.

﻿ ﻿ ﻿

Future Forward PAC’s approach has generated criticism for its intimidating tone toward voters, many who may fear social repercussions for low turnout.

One social media user described it as an “extremely creepy” and “borderline threatening” message.

Another suggested the ads carry a “not-so-veiled threat,” while another described them as conjuring up “dystopian vibes.”

“This insane dystopian ad threatening ‘your friends and family’ will know if you voted or not is somehow very real and being aired by Kamala Harris’s allies across the country,” wrote one social media user.

“We are at the stage of the election where Dems are running ads threatening to name and publicly shame their low-propensity voters,” another stated.

The ad campaign reflects the Democratic Party’s focus on high-stakes swing states where black voter turnout is crucial to their electoral strategy. In 2020, urban black voter turnout helped secure Biden’s win, but recent polls show slipping support among black men and Hispanic voters. With Trump gaining ground, Future Forward PAC, backed by Silicon Valley donors, unleashed over $700 million to bolster Harris and other Democrats this cycle.

A dark money giant funded by key tech donors including Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and secretive nonprofits like the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Future Forward PAC spent over $100 million backing Joe Biden in 2020, ranking as the third largest advertiser of the election. By 2024, the group had raised close to $400 million, with $25 million from its Super PAC and the rest from dark-money sources.

Future Forward remains central to Democratic efforts, bolstered by significant contributions from left-wing donors, including George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, and a slew of progressive billionaires. As Harris’s main super PAC, it received a $9 million donation from a fund tied to the League of Conservation Voters in August, alongside $3 million from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.

The PAC, the biggest spender in the campaign by far, aims to flood airwaves during the last weeks leading up to the election with pro-Harris ads and aggressively push for progressive policies through highly unconventional strategies.
Former President Donald Trump and former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent vow to tackle public health issues together could signal a major shift in Republican priorities if the Trump campaign prevails on Election Day.

Trump has called for the creation of an independent commission with Kennedy’s input and pledged to address various Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) issues the former independent candidate has brought to the forefront, including improving the public’s intake of nutritious foods and addressing the rising trend of obesity in adults. These concerns, in addition to other MAHA priorities that have not historically found much support in the GOP such as calling for more stringent environmental regulations, indicate that a potential Trump administration may take a different approach on health, agricultural and environmental issues than during his first term in office.

Campaign officials, GOP lawmakers and health experts previewed a diverse set of MAHA priorities in interviews with the Daily Caller News Foundation. Tackling the rising chronic disease rate that impacts roughly 60% of American adults is a shared point of concern.

“It’s finally turning the page and saying, ‘We want a health system, not a disease system,'” Dr. Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told the DCNF. “For 50 years we built a disease system.”

“When we send President Trump back to the White House, he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr. to Make America Healthy Again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children,” Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, told the DCNF. “President Trump will also establish a special Presidential Commission of independent minds who are not bought and paid for by Big Pharma and will charge them with investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illnesses.”

Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) October 23, 2024

Republicans and former Trump health officials are enthusiastic that marshaling the federal government in response to the country’s myriad health crises could turn the corner on an era where Americans are facing poorer health outcomes and declining life expectancy.

Redfield endorsed the idea of an independent chronic disease commission and told the DCNF that the federal government “must get more serious in preventing chronic disease” to turn the corner on an era where Americans are facing poorer health outcomes and declining life expectancy.

“It’s much more important to get real time, continuous, day-to-day monitoring of your chronic illness, not just the way the system works now where you check in every six months and someone tells you how you’re doing,” Redfield added. “No, you’ve got to check in every day.”

According to Redfield, a second Trump administration could cut the more than $4 trillion Americans spend on healthcare every year by half if federal agencies take an “all-of-government” approach to targeting substance use disorder, obesity and ultra-processed foods in addition to improving mental health services.

“These are, in my view, low-hanging fruit,” Redfield told the DCNF. “That alone would improve the American health system substantially.”

Texas Agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, who is helping vet candidates to serve in a second Trump administration, recounted running into a swarm of British schoolchildren while on a recent trade mission to the United Kingdom as providing further confirmation that a second Trump term must take action on obesity and processed foods, in an interview with the DCNF.

“90s kids and there wasn’t one fat kid in the bunch,” Miller, who has also called for bringing back the presidential fitness test program retired by the Obama administration in 2012, told the DCNF. “That kind of inspired me and made me think we’re not doing something right.”

To improve health outcomes for the more than 40% of Americans that are obese, Miller told the DCNF that a second Trump administration should consider ending Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for processed foods.

“Why are we paying for soda drinks and cookies and junk food with SNAP benefits?” Miller told the DCNF. “That needs to stop.”

Miller also pointed to his Texas Fresh Farm program that provides fresh and local products to more than 5 million Texas school members as a program that should be implemented nationwide to improve a portion of the public’s intake of nutritious foods.

Republican lawmakers have also been supportive of a second Trump administration prioritizing nutrition as part of the MAHA agenda.

“As a physician, I can absolutely say that good nutrition leads to better patient outcomes 100 percent of the time. Healthy food is medicine and is the cure for many chronic diseases and curbing health care spending in the United States,” Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas told the DCNF in a statement. “American farmers set the gold standard for nutritious food, and the MAHA agenda will work with farmers and ranchers to continue producing the safest and most wholesome food at affordable prices for our country and the world.”

Implementing MAHA priorities will likely require the empowerment of federal government agencies whose budgets and enforcement powers Republican lawmakers could be inclined to shrink. Taking action on chronic disease and obesity will also necessitate buy-in from members of the public and lawmakers that have lost trust in institutions’ abilities to tell the truth and manage crises without infringing on a person’s individual autonomy.

“Our failed response to the pandemic opened the eyes of millions to the capture and corruption of federal agencies by the corporate interests who are supposed to be regulated by them,” Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin told the DCNF. “As a result, the public’s interest is not being well-served or properly protected.”

“Getting public health officials in the next administration that really spend a lot of energy on trying to reestablish public trust is going to be fundamental to the success of the efforts of Making America Healthy Again,” Redfield told the DCNF. “The vaccine mandates were a big mistake. Closing down our economy—a big mistake. Shutting down our schools—a big mistake. So, there was a huge loss of credibility and trust that has to be rebuilt.”

Redfield is still a strong believer in vaccines, dubbing them as “the most important gift to modern medicine,” but said that vaccine mandates are a self-defeating approach and that debate about a vaccine’s safety and efficacy should be encouraged not denounced. (RELATED: House Republicans Call On Federal Agency To Drop COVID Vaccine Rules)

“I’ve always said that Bobby Kennedy is not anti-vax. Bobby Kennedy just wanted honest transparency and debate about vaccines,” Redfield told the DCNF. “We should foster discussion and debate, and if someone has a question about looking at data to determine a vaccine’s safety that shouldn’t be listed as anti-vax. That should be listed as wanting an honest, open discussion about what is the data?”

“As we secure our borders and rebuild our economy, we are also going to Make America Healthy Again,” Trump said at a campaign event with Kennedy in Duluth, Georgia, on Wednesday. “We have more chronic health problems than any nation, more childhood diseases than we did just a generation ago. Millions of Americans are realizing that something is wrong. By getting this fixed not only will we have healthier families, we will save trillions and trillions of dollars and bring down the cost of healthcare.”

“We have a thousand chemicals in our food that are illegal in Europe, but the problem is not from those chemicals. The big problem is corruption in our federal agencies. These agencies are now owned by big Pharma by ‘Big Food’ and Big Agriculture,” Kennedy told the crowd at the same event. “Don’t you want a president that’s going to get the chemicals out of our food? And don’t you want a president that’s going to get the corruption out of Washington, D.C.? And don’t we deserve a president of the United States that’s going to Make America Healthy Again?”

Redfield also told the DCNF that he’s willing to serve in a second Trump administration.

“I’m in the final turn,” Redfield told the DCNF. “I’d obviously work in any way I can to help the President and Bobby Kennedy and our nation move toward health.”

Kennedy did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

As California state Assemblymember Evan Low and former San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo vie to win the U.S. House election in California's 16th Congressional District, Golden State Gov. Gavin Newsom has thrown his support behind Low in the Democrat versus Democrat showdown.

"Evan Low embodies the very best of California's values," Newsom said in a statement, according to Politico. "We have worked shoulder-to-shoulder on some of our state's most pressing issues, from protecting reproductive rights to tackling affordability for California families."

"Evan Low embodies the very best of California values. We have worked shoulder-to-shoulder on some of our state's most pressing issues," the governor said in a statement, according to NBC Bay Area. "Evan’s proven track record of delivering for Bay Area families makes him exactly the kind of representative CD-16 voters deserve in Washington."

In a post on X, Low said that he is "thrilled and deeply honored to have the endorsement" from the governor, whose "leadership and vision for CA have been an inspiration."

Low wished Vice President Kamala Harris a happy birthday on Oct. 20.

"Happy Birthday to our future president, Kamala Harris!" he tweeted. "I'm so proud to stand with you and honored to be running on the same Democratic Party ticket. Your leadership, tenacity, and dedication to fighting for justice and equality inspire us all. Here's to many more years of breaking barriers and making history together!"

The district is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo, who did not seek re-election in 2024.

‘I WOULD NEVER TURN MY BACK ON PRESIDENT BIDEN’: NEWSOM SHOWS SUPPORT AT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Newsom, who has served as governor since early 2019, won re-election in 2022 after surviving a recall election in 2021.

Last year, he debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who at the time was running for the GOP presidential nomination. Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity moderated the debate.

During the debate, DeSantis called Newsom "a slick, slippery politician, whose state is failing."

DeSantis ultimately dropped his presidential bid in January and endorsed former President Donald Trump after Trump won the Iowa caucus.
Coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC News of the presidential race between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris has been the most "lopsided in history," a new study released one week before the election found.

Analysis from the Media Research Center (MRC) published Monday found that Harris has received 78% positive coverage on broadcast evening news since July, versus Trump, who has been the subject of 85% negative coverage on the same networks.

"The difference in coverage between the two candidates is far greater than in 2016, when both Trump and then-challenger Hillary Clinton received mostly negative coverage [91% negative for Trump, vs. 79% negative for Clinton,]" according to MRC analysts.

FOR THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, MORE AMERICANS HAVE ‘NO TRUST’ IN MEDIA THAN THOSE WHO DO

The disparity between the Trump and Harris coverage is even greater than in 2020, "when Joe Biden was treated to 66% positive coverage, vs. 92% negative for Trump," the study reads.

MRC reported that ABC, CBS and NBC have spent more than 200 minutes of airtime, most of it negative, harping on controversies surrounding Trump while glossing over or, in many cases, outright ignoring controversies related to Harris - such as plagiarism accusations and allegations surrounding her husband, Doug Emhoff.

"Instead, Harris’ coverage has been larded with enthusiastic quotes from pro-Harris voters, creating a positive ‘vibe’ for the Democrat even as network reporters criticize Trump themselves," MRC writes.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

Analysts reviewed more than 600 segments about the presidential race that aired on ABC, CBS or NBC beginning on the day President Biden suspended his candidacy in late July, through October 25.

After weeks of glowing coverage for Harris as the Democratic nominee, the three networks seemingly changed their tone following the debate between Harris and Trump in September, the MRC analysts found.

"The networks shifted attention away from Harris, spending significantly more airtime targeting Trump," the report reads.

"From the date Harris entered the race on July 21 through September 10, she received 353 minutes of network evening news coverage, virtually identical to the 355 minutes given Trump during the same period. Since then, however, TV has focused nearly twice as much attention on Trump as Harris: 398 minutes for the former President, compared to just 230 minutes for the Vice President," the study found.

"The additional airtime for Trump was hardly meant as a gift. Instead, it reflected the networks’ intensive focus on Trump controversies, providing opportunities for negative news coverage," according to MRC.

Roughly 31% of the 753 minutes of evening news spent on Trump since July 21 spotlighted his personal controversies, the study found. "This compares to barely five percent of Harris’s airtime [28 minutes, out of a total 583 minutes of coverage] spent on similar topics.

The networks repeatedly cited January 6 and Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was rigged while labeling him as a "danger to democracy," MRC reported.

Comparatively, "Harris faced no such onslaught. Over fourteen weeks, evening news viewers heard a scant 5 minutes, 22 seconds of GOP criticisms that she’s too liberal, barely one-sixth the airtime spent on the claim Trump is a ‘fascist.’ None of this coverage included any criticisms of Harris from either network reporters or nonpartisan sources," MRC analysts found.

"Add it all up, and the media coverage of the past three months is more lopsided than that of any presidential election in the modern media age," the report reads.

"So if Donald Trump regains the White House next week, the media’s campaign against him will have accomplished nothing, except the further erosion of their own reputations."

The MRC findings come shortly after a Gallup study revealed that trust remains both historically and consistently low in the media. Only 31% of those polled expressed a "great deal" or "fair amount" of faith in the media to report news properly.

"For the third consecutive year, more U.S. adults have no trust at all in the media (36%) than trust it a great deal or fair amount. Another 33% of Americans express ‘not very much’ confidence," Gallup Senior Editor Megan Brenan wrote.

ABC, CBS and NBC News did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News Channel viewership crushed MSNBC and CNN across the board in October as the 2024 political season heated up.

October was another jam-packed news month as the election race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump dominated headlines. Americans relied on Fox News Channel for information and analysis, as the network averaged 1.6 million total day viewers to finish No. 1 among all cable offerings.

Fox News was the only cable channel to surpass the one-million viewer mark, as MSNBC finished No. 2 with 903,000 average viewers and ESPN finished third with 811,000. CNN managed only 532,000 average viewers during October to finish with roughly 1/3 of Fox News’ viewership.

Fox News also finished No. 1 from 8-11 p.m. ET, averaging 2.8 million primetime viewers to thumb cable news competitors. ESPN managed 2.3 million viewers to finish second, followed by TBS, MSNBC and Fox Sports 1. CNN averaged only 830,000 viewers from 8-11 p.m. ET to finish sixth in the category.

When it comes to the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults age 25-54, Fox News averaged 212,000 total day viewers from the critical group compared to 100,000 for CNN and only 97,000 for MSNBC. During primetime, Fox News averaged 359,000 demo viewers compared to 175,000 for CNN and 160,000 for MSNBC.

Fox News has now topped CNN and MSNBC in all categories for 44 straight months.

"The Five," with Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, Jeanine Pirro and rotating co-hosts Jessica Tarlov and Harold Ford Jr., finished as the most-watched show on cable news, averaging 3.6 million total viewers.

FOX NEWS DIGITAL CRUSHES CNN, NY TIMES, OTHER MAJOR NEWS BRANDS IN KEY METRICS DURING THIRD QUARTER

"The Five," "Jesse Watters Primetime," "Hannity," "Gutfeld!," "Special Report with Bret Baier," "The Ingraham Angle," "Outnumbered," "The Faulkner Focus," "America’s Newsroom" with Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer, "America Reports" with Sandra Smith and John Roberts, Martha MacCallum’s "The Story" and "Your World with Neil Cavuto" all beat anything CNN or MSNBC had to offer as Fox News was home to the top 12 most-watched programs.

MSNBC’s top show was "Deadline: White House," which finished No. 13 in cable news. CNN’s most popular show, "Anderson Cooper 360," finished No. 26 behind 14 different Fox News shows and 11 MSNBC offerings.

"Jesse Watters Primetime" took home the demo crown, leading cable news with 454,000 average viewers among the advertiser-coveted group.

"Special Report" anchor Bret Baier’s interview with Harris on Oct. 16 drew a staggering 9.2 million total viewers, making it the most-watched non-primetime interview in cable news history.

CBS NEWS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE FAILS TO BOOST NETWORK’S EVENING NEWSCAST AUDIENCE

"FOX & Friends," "FOX & Friends First" and "FOX News @ Night" all had strong months, too, as Fox News aired 94 of the top 100 cable news telecasts for the month. "The Big Weekend Show" was the most-watched program in cable news on both Saturdays and Sundays during October.

Fox News’ simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz averaged nearly 11 million viewers.

Fox News remained the No. 1 network in all of cable news among upscale, Hispanic and Asian viewers during total day viewership and among the key demo. Additionally, more Independents and Democrats continued to watch Fox News over any other network, according to data from Nielsen MRI Fusion.

Newspaper presidential endorsements used to be newsworthy. Now, they only make news when they don’t happen. Both journalists and the left automatically assume the papers will support Democrats like they do the other 364 days a year.

But fast-forward to the 2024 presidential election, where we are living through a real-time fact check of news media neutrality and watching the press fail big time.

Liberal staffers of the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post saw their plans to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president canceled and the uproar that followed was as predictable as their usual list of endorsements. Of course, they’re upset. They spent years pretending Donald Trump is evil incarnate, but not even the guys who write their checks believe them.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, owns the Post. He wrote a piece for the paper explaining how journalism has lost credibility and, "Most people believe the media is biased." (Duh.) He admitted some of the problem, noting, "It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility." But he didn't. He added that canceling endorsements is "a meaningful step in the right direction."

Bezos probably won’t win many media friends, saying, "Lack of credibility isn’t unique to The Post. Our brethren newspapers have the same issue." And then adding that, "The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite."

That endorsement boycott is catching. USA Today just did the unthinkable and embraced it. A spokesperson from the paper reportedly told the Daily Beast that the paper will provide readers with "the facts that matter and the trusted information they need to make informed decisions." The Tampa Times joined in the fun, as well. The era of newspapers openly expressing their biases might be coming to an end before our eyes.

Here are three more reasons for the leftist media freakout:

WASHINGTON POST SKIPS WHITE HOUSE ENDORSEMENT, BUT LIBERAL TILT STILL EVIDENT IN SENATE AND HOUSE NODS

Caving to Trump

Journalists at both newspapers threw a collective tantrum over the canceled endorsements and others in their field were there to support them. NPR’s David Folkenflik asked if the news outlets "pull[ed] punches to appease Trump?" MSNBC opinion editor Jarvis DeBerry declared, "The rich owners of The Washington Post and L.A. Times just capitulated to Trump." Vanity Fair warned that billionaires were in "fear of retribution by Donald Trump." And Slate paraphrased the Post slogan, "Democracy’s Death in Darkness."

CNN’s reliable Trump hater Brian Stelter wrote in a special Reliable Sources newsletter, "the appearance of caving to Trump does real and lasting damage to any enterprise that isn't identified as pro-Trump." Caving to Trump means not giving full-throated support to his opponent.

Journalists think their bosses might be "caving to Trump" because they believe he’s going to win. Newsies are terrified the bosses are right.

FAR FEWER NEWSPAPERS ARE ENDORSING HARRIS THAN BACKED CLINTON OR BIDEN

Going Postie

Because the Post is based in the nation’s capital, there was more of a media freakout for that decision. Current and former Post staffers lined up to defend their open support of Democrats – like always. (They’ve endorsed every single Democrat presidential nominee going back into the 1980s.)

Former executive editor Marty Baron blasted the paper’s decision as, "cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty." Pulitzer Prize winner David Maraniss, a Post associate editor, called the move "contemptible." He added, "This is an act not of benign neutrality but of cowardice in the face of the biggest challenge to democracy in our post-World War II lifetimes."

Opinion page writers expressed their angst under the headline: "The newspaper’s refusal to endorse a presidential candidate is a mistake." Eighteen Post columnists delivered a generic response saying the move "represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love." It was the kind of milquetoast wording guaranteed to protect their hefty paychecks. (Three outraged Post staffers actually resigned.)

LA TIMES OWNER’S DAUGHTER ON WHY PAPER REFUSED TO ENDORSE 2024 CANDIDATE: 'GENOCIDE IS THE LINE IN THE SAND'

Posties all fantasize that they are Woodward and Bernstein still fighting an evil Nixon presidency. In reality, they are a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party and covered up President Biden’s obvious cognitive issues until he was destroyed in the presidential debate. They don’t aspire to be journalists. They want to harm Republicans.

And, of course, the actual Watergate duo of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein called the publisher’s action "disappointing" and said it "ignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy."

That threat to "democracy" is a common media and far left lie from outlets that freak out that their approved candidate might not win. What really scares Posties is a threat that Democrats might lose.

Upsetting Hollywood

Naturally, celebrities were up in arms, too – either complaining or even canceling their subscriptions. Because one of the top two leftist newspapers in the U.S. wasn’t far left enough for them. And that upset journalists even more, because the far left is their real audience.

The liberal celebrities either calling for subscribers to cancel or just whining about the lack of endorsements would look familiar to anyone who follows social media. Actors Henry "the Fonz" Winkler, Jeffrey Wright and Jon Cryer, author Stephen King, New York Daily News sports columnist Mike Lupica and lots more. Former Obama and Biden adviser Susan Rice complained on X, "As a DC native and lifelong subscriber to the Post, I’m disgusted. You have lost us."

Both critics and competitors of the papers got the last laugh. Conservatives mocked the far left’s purity test that had them cancel subscriptions, while The Atlantic begged, "Don’t Cancel The Washington Post. Cancel Amazon Prime."

The New York Times reminded readers why it remains the most far-left newspaper in America by endorsing Harris, "The Only Patriotic Choice for President." The paper actively hates patriotism, except when staffers think it might convince a few rubes to vote their way.

In reality, journalists don’t care what readers think. News staffers gave up pretending they were unbiased decades ago, even before the Gen Z activists invaded their organizations.

The whole episode will give journalists someone to blame if Trump wins re-election. They’ll never accept that decades of bias completely undermined their influence. And that happened long before their publishers ran from Harris faster than rats leaving a sinking ship.

Republican nominee Donald Trump invited the family members of victims impacted by the policies of the Biden-Harris administration to his press conference Tuesday ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ major campaign speech in Washington, D.C.

The former president held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where he invited angel mom Tammy Nobles, who lost her daughter to the brutality of an MS-13 member, and gold star mother-in-law Christy Shamblin who lost her daughter-in-law, Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee, during the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The victims came forward to link the tragedies to Harris’ policies before she gave a major speech at the National Mall Tuesday.

Nobles’ daughter, Kayla Hamilton, died on July 27, 2022, after 17-year-old MS-13 gang member Walter Martinez allegedly raped and strangled her to death with a telephone cord in Aberdeen, Maryland.

“I just wanted to say that [the Department of] Homeland Security did not do their job, Health and Human Services did not do their job, the Biden-Harris administration did not do their job,” Nobles said. “If they would have done their job, maybe that one phone call to El Salvador, maybe my daughter would still be alive today. Kayla was a very beautiful, young lady inside and out. She was independent, learning to become independent, she had two jobs, she overcame obstacles dealing with autism and was able to find the job that she loved. She loved animals, especially her cat Oreo and she cared about the homeless. She loved God, and she loved going to church and her life was just ripped from her 3 days after she celebrated her 20th birthday.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed that Martinez was involved with a violent MS-13 gang and resided in the U.S. illegally, according to WMAR 2 News. He reportedly entered the U.S. through Texas illegally in March 2022 before Border Patrol released him into Maryland to live with a sponsor.

Trump said Harris’ border and economic policies, along with her actions toward the Afghanistan withdrawal, are “disqualifying” for her to serve as commander-in-chief.

“Kamala’s cruel and immoral actions on our border are actually disqualifying in my opinion. She’s unfit, she’s an unfit person and she knows this is going on,” Trump said. “She didn’t call anybody, including the 13 soldiers that were so needlessly killed in Afghanistan with that horrible moment in time when our country just lost all respect from the whole world when that happened … Kamala has also caused untold misery through her destruction of our economy.”

Shamblin’s daughter-in-law, Marine Sergeant Gee, was one of the thirteen service members who died during the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan on Aug. 26, 2021, in which Harris had bragged about being the last person in the room during the administration’s decision to withdraw.

“[Gee] was the cornerstone of a very large family,” Shamblin emotionally said. “And instead of planning family gatherings, and holiday meals, and Christmases and baby showers, our family and thousands of other families plan outings at funeral gravesites and that’s where we as a family celebrate my daughter-in-law at Arlington National Cemetery because she is in the ground. Her story isn’t unique to our family, she’s just ours. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of wounded veterans who came home from that war who need our help and who are ignored by our current administration.”

The former president attended a ceremony honoring the 13 service members on the third anniversary of the withdrawal, while President Joe Biden and Harris were not in attendance.

Federal immigration law under the Biden-Harris administration allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to “parole” migrants instead of detaining them for “humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,” which has been challenged by many Republican-led states.

Illegal encounters exceeded 2 million in the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, largely surpassing encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Trump administration, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was released from prison Tuesday morning after serving a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 Select Committee.

Bannon was was taken into custody July 1 following an order from Judge Carl J. Nichols granting prosecutors’ motion requiring the “War Room” host to serve the four-month sentence he received in Oct. 2022.

Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Randilee Giamusso confirmed Bannon’s release, according to NBC News. Bannon started his sentence shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the Democrat ticket.

“Steve Bannon is a free man,” Natalie Winters, the guest host of Bannon’s show during his imprisonment, wrote on Twitter.

Bannon filed a last-ditch motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in late June in an attempt to avoid prison time.

Bannon told political commentator Tucker Carlson he does not fear going to prison before his sentence began. (RELATED: Tucker Gives His Most Fiery Speech Yet: ‘They Went Out Of Their Way To Humiliate You And Spit On You And The Graves Of Your Ancestors)

“From the Justice Department to the FBI, the Wall Street crowd, you can see this everywhere in our society, the attacks on the family,” Bannon said at the time. “And they play for keeps. And I’m so glad that the Alex Joneses and the Tucker Carlsons, and particularly since you had the opportunity to leave Fox, uh, ourselves, and so many others now understand that this is a war to the knife, right?”

“We have to win this,” he continued. “If we don’t win this, this country’s going to devolve into some kind of neo-Marxist totalitarian regime of which is pretty far down the road right now.

Harris is set to deliver her closing arguments to “turn the page” on Trump during a campaign event at the Washington, D.C.’s, Ellipse — the location of Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021 rally, according to ABC News.
CNN fired conservative commentator Ryan James Girdusky after a heated Monday night exchange that started after former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan defended calling Trump supporters Nazis.

CNN host Abby Phillip shared a CNN statement that said Girdusky would not be allowed on the network after the fiery exchange, and apologized to Hasan following the incident. Girdusky had earlier clashed with Phillip over media portrayals of Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden before Hasan and Girdusky’s heated exchange.

“Nobody wants to be called Nazis. It‘s very inflammatory, but if you don‘t want to be called Nazis, stop doing-” Hasan said after making the comparison, prompting Girdusky to cut in and say, “You’re called an antisemite more than anyone at this table,”

“Are you calling me an antisemite?” Hasan asked, with Girdusky responding, “No, I’m just saying people call you that.”

WATCH:



Hasan has been a vociferous critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and of Israel’s response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by the radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas that killed over 1,200 people.

“I’m used to it because I support the Palestinians,” Hasan said.

“Well, I hope your beeper doesn’t go off,” Girdusky responded, referring to an Israeli operation that targeted the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah. Girdusky apologized repeatedly for the remark, saying he thought the former MSNBC host mentioned Hamas. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Anarchy U”)

Girdusky was removed from the panel and Phillip later addressed the exchange on-air after a commercial break.

“I want to just address what happened in the last segment. First, I want to apologize to Mehdi Hasan for what was said at this table. It was completely unacceptable,” Phillip said. “When we get this discussion started, you’ll see that Ryan is not at the table. There is a line that was crossed there and it’s not acceptable to me, it’s not acceptable to us at this network. We want discussion, we want people who disagree with each other to talk to each other, but when you cross the line of a complete lack of civility, that is not going to happen here on this show.”

Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on Trump, labeling him a “fascist” during an Oct. 24 CNN town hall. Walz compared Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally by Nazi sympathizers Sunday. “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski called the rally at Madison Square Garden hate speech Monday, while Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson compared it to the Nazi rally on the MSNBC morning program Tuesday.

You can stay on CNN if you falsely call every Republican a Nazi and have taken money from Qatar-funded media. Apparently you can’t go on CNN if you make a joke. I’m glad America gets to see what CNN stands for. — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) October 29, 2024

“You can stay on CNN if you falsely call every Republican a Nazi and have taken money from Qatar-funded media,” Girdusky posted on X after the exchange. “Apparently you can’t go on CNN if you make a joke. I’m glad America gets to see what CNN stands for.”

The FBI is “willfully covering up” Iranian interference in the 2024 presidential election, House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) warned Monday.

The FBI, which has been long criticized for the weaponization of justice dating back to 2016 and 2020, now appears to be playing politics with the 2024 election.

C-SPAN

The bureau is “doubling down on its politicization and corruption” by “willfully covering up — about Iranian influence in the 2024 presidential election,” Stefanik wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed as a senior Intelligence Committee member.

In recent months, Iran targeted Trump by hacking, sending hacked information to Democrat media allies, and trying to carry out assassination plots. Those acts against American democracy deserve transparency, argued Stefanik, who provided 13 questions that the FBI has refused to answer.

Stefanik wrote:

I’ve been in enough high-profile oversight hearings to know that when witnesses squirm and refuse to answer questions, it usually means I’ve uncovered something concerning. At that briefing last month, after a long, panicked pause, the FBI promised to follow up with answers. The bureau obviously wanted my questions to go away and be forgotten. After the briefing, I wrote Director Christopher Wray requiring responses by Oct. 7. The avoidance games continued. First, the bureau said it would deliver answers at an in-person briefing as demanded. Then it promised written answers, which it failed to provide. The FBI has now gone silent, ignoring the congressional questions. I believe it is because top FBI officials know the answers will be bombshells. … On this issue of critical importance to the presidential election, the Intelligence Committee knows little more than the public does. We know Iranian hackers stole sensitive information from the Trump campaign and sent it to at least three people affiliated with Joe Biden’s campaign in June. We know Iranians also sent the stolen information to Politico, the Washington Post and the New York Times. We know Iran is plotting to assassinate Mr. Trump. We know the threat against his life is active and unresolved, despite the July arrest of a Pakistani national with ties to Iran in connection with that plot. We don’t know when or how the FBI became aware, or what and when its communication was with the Biden and Harris campaigns or the Biden administration.

Stefanik’s allegation is serious, but the allegation mirrors concerns that some Republicans raised in 2016 and 2020.

Former FBI Director James Comey failed to inform Congress in 2016 about his decision to open a counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, into then-candidate Trump for allegedly colluding with the Russians. The allegation bled well into Trump’s term but was ultimately debunked as a hoax pushed by Democrat operatives.

Politico. Years later, in June 2024, an FBI agent In 2020, the FBI, which possessed Hunter Biden’s laptop, allowed American voters to believe the laptop was Russian disinformation, a claim that grew out of a letter signed by 51 intelligence officials and published by. Years later, in June 2024, an FBI agent told a Delaware jury the FBI possessed the laptop and no tampering occurred with the machine.

Seventy-one percent of Americans believe accurate reporting of Hunter Biden’s “Laptop from Hell” could have altered the 2020 presidential election, TIPP Insights polling revealed in 2022.

The establishment media’s control over framing the election narrative is “shattered,” Axios’s Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen acknowledged Monday.

The report confirms Gallup polling that shows Americans’ trust in the media is at an all-time low. For years, the media has pushed false narratives that involved Hunter Biden’s laptop story, Russian collusion, the source of the 2020 pandemic, the January 6 investigation, and numerous other hoaxes.

The establishment media’s “dominance in narrative- and reality-shaping in presidential elections shattered in 2024,” due to the rise of alternative media in the era of new technology, streaming services, podcasts, and the liberated platform of X, VandeHei and Allen reported:

Both campaigns have targeted small, often little-appreciated shards to reach hyper-specific pockets of potential voters. The campaigns are doing this with unorthodox, sometimes lengthy media appearances and precision ad targeting.

Former President Trump reached way more potential male voters with his three-hour Rogan conversation (33 million views over the weekend) than he could have with a dozen or more appearances on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC combined. All three cable news networks skew very old in viewership, with median ages ranging from 67 to 70.

Vice President Kamala Harris reached more young women on Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, a show about sex and relationships, than she could on CBS’ “60 Minutes” and ABC’s “The View” combined. Both shows skew very old, too.

Americans’ trust in the establishment media to report current events “fully, accurately and fairly” plummeted to a record low in 2024, Gallup polling found in October. Only 31 percent of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media to tell the truth, one point below its low watermark of 32 percent in 2016 and 2023.

Gallup reported its findings:

Americans continue to register record-low trust in the mass media, with 31% expressing a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly,” similar to last year’s 32%. Americans’ trust in the media — such as newspapers, television and radio — first fell to 32% in 2016 and did so again last year. For the third consecutive year, more U.S. adults have no trust at all in the media (36%) than trust it a great deal or fair amount. Another 33% of Americans express “not very much” confidence. … As has been the case historically, partisans have different levels of confidence in the media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly. Currently, 54% of Democrats, 27% of independents and 12% of Republicans say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Independents’ trust matches the record low in 2022, while Democrats’ and Republicans’ are statistically similar to their historical low points.

Americans’ trust in the media in the 1970s ranged from the low 70s to the high 60s but sank to the low 50s in the Bush administration. During the Obama administration, it hovered above 40 percent and tanked to its lowest mark with the rise of former President Donald Trump.

"The View" host Whoopi Goldberg issued a crazed warning about what will happen to interracial couples under a second term of President Donald Trump, whose re-election prospects look high.

On Monday, Goldberg said Trump will split up couples in which one spouse is an illegal immigrant and reassign the white "guy" to another woman.

'These are the final hours.'

"He is talking about you. It’s us. He’s not going to be — he’s not going to, you know, say, ‘Oh, you’re with a white guy, I’m going to keep you from being deported.’ No, he’s going to deport you and put the white guy with someone else. The man is out there," Goldberg yelled.

Goldberg and the other hosts of "The View" were in hysterics on Monday following Trump's massively attended rally in New York City at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Guest Mika Brzezinski added to the hyperventilating over the rally, calling it a "Nazi-type" gathering, even though minorities and Jewish supporters were at Madison Square Garden for the event.

"It was everything that you need to know about Donald Trump in one weird, white nationalist, Nazi-type rally and, of course, there are historic parallels to where and when this happened," she continued. "I come with such dire warnings, and I mean them from the bottom of my heart!"

"These are the final hours. We need you, we need you, you, you, you, and all of you to vote," Brzezinski added.

The prospect of mass deportations has become more stark with Trump leading in the polls against Vice President Kamala Harris. Tom Homan, who was the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under former Trump, said if there are concerns about families being split up because some are in the country illegally, then "families can be deported together."

Trump has proposed using the National Guard and local law enforcement to help ICE officers track down and remove illegal aliens since that population has grown exponentially under the Biden-Harris administration. Democrats and open-border advocates have claimed the deportation process will be too costly and will do more harm than good.

(AP) — Bad Bunny threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday by sharing a video of the Democratic presidential nominee shortly after a comedian at Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally made crude jokes about Latinos and called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” angering artists and some Hispanic Republicans.

Bad Bunny, whose official name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is one of the most famous artists of the moment. His backing could be a boost for the Harris campaign as it tries to bolster its support with Latino voters, among whom Trump has been working to gain ground.

The video Bad Bunny shared with his 45 million Instagram followers shows Harris saying “there’s so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters and for Puerto Rico.” A representative of the artist confirmed that Bad Bunny is supporting Harris.

Bad Bunny signaled his support moments after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made the remarks on Puerto Rico. Later, Hinchcliffe said “these Latinos, they love making babies” and said they don’t use the pull-out birth control method.

The comments on Puerto Rico were immediately criticized by Harris’ campaign, but were also called out by Angel Cintron, the head of the GOP on the island, and Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, who represents parts of Miami and has participated in recent Trump events.

Salazar wrote: “Disgusted by “@TonyHinchcliffe’s racist comment calling Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ This rhetoric does not reflect GOP values. Puerto Rico sent 48,000+ soldiers to Vietnam, with over 345 Purple Hearts awarded. This bravery deserves respect. Educate yourself!”

Trump campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez in a statement said “this joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”

Luis Fonsi, a Puerto Rican artist who sings the hit “Despacito,” went on Instagram and wrote “going down this racist path ain’t it.”

“We are not OK with this constant hate,” he wrote in a message shared on Instagram. “It’s been abundantly clear that these people have no respect for us.”

Ricky Martin, who had previously endorsed Harris, was also offended by the comment and said “that’s what they think of us,” on Instagram.

In showing support, Bad Bunny shared several times another part of the clip Harris made on Puerto Rico, saying “I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader.”

The 30-year-old Puerto Rican reggaeton artist, who has popular songs such as “Dakiti” and “Titi Me Preguntó,” has won three Grammy Awards. He was the most streamed artist on Spotify in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and was only surpassed by Taylor Swift in 2023. He was named Artist of the Year by Apple Music in 2022.

The Puerto Rican vote is sizable in Pennsylvania, which is arguably the hardest fought of the swing states in the 2024 election. Other Puerto Rican singers such as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony had already expressed support for Harris. Trump has also attracted support from other popular stars from the island such as Anuel AA and Nicky Jam.

Bad Bunny has been vocal about criticizing Puerto Rico’s electric system, which was razed by Hurricane Maria. In a 2022 music video for his song “El Apagon,” the artist called out the company Luma Energy, which handles transmission and distribution, for the constant power outages that plague the island.

One of his most recent songs, “Una Velita,” is also a protest against the government response following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.

A year after the storm, public health experts estimated that nearly 3,000 perished because of the effects of Hurricane Maria. But Trump, whose efforts to help the island territory recover have been persistently criticized, repeatedly questioned that number saying it rose “like magic.”

His visit to the island after the hurricane elicited controversy such as when he tossed paper towels. His administration released $13 billion in assistance years later, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election. And a federal government watchdog found that officials hampered an investigation into delays in aid delivery.

Bad Bunny also shared a part of the clip showing Harris saying that Trump “abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.”

Harris visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia earlier on Sunday and released her policy related to the island saying she wants to create a task force to attract investment to fix the electrical grid. And Trump is headed on Tuesday to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where more than half of its population is Hispanic and a majority of them from Puerto Rico.

In 2020, Bad Bunny allowed the Biden campaign to use one of his hits “Pero Ya No” in a TV ad.
Blocks from the U.S. Capitol, a limo burst into flames moments after dropping guests off at Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Flares and bricks flew through its windows. The driver, Luis Villarroel, fled his torched car, which belonged to a Muslim immigrant small business owner.

Throughout D.C., store windows were smashed, car doors dented. Police stood shoulder to shoulder unloading pepper spray on protesters.

In the middle of the chaos, Trump put his hand on the Bible, took an oath and became the 45th president of the United States.

“In 2016, I just don’t think that the population was prepared for it, and that’s why we didn’t see wider-spread unrest, because nobody expected it to happen,” Richie McGinniss, a longtime video journalist who has covered social unrest for years, told the Caller. McGinnis was previously the video director for the Daily Caller.

“I hate to say it, but it’s going to be a lot worse [in 2024] than it was in 2016 if Trump wins.”

In 2016, Trump stunned the nation by defeating Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Instantly, Democrats were shocked and began to melt down. Images of Clinton supporters falling to their knees, crying and screaming, went viral.

Much of the corporate media was no less hysterical, decrying Jan. 20, 2017 as a dark day for America.

Eight years later, after being dragged from courthouse to courthouse, two assassination attempts and being labeled a “fascist” by his opponents daily, Trump has a real chance at another victory against long odds. The Daily Caller spoke to various experts across the political landscape about what to expect if that happens. From violence in the streets, to Democrats’ plans to contest a Trump win, to the media meltdown, to election lawfare from Democratic super-lawyer Marc Elias, they all predicted a much more dangerous and extreme response this time around if the “threat to democracy” is democratically elected.

McGinniss told the Caller he is preparing for unrest across the country that will be more intense than what was seen in 2016. He says nearly a decade of persistent anti-Trump messaging will be an accelerant for extremism.

“[We’ve been] told that, effectively, our country is going to be under a dictatorship if Trump wins,” McGinniss told the Caller.

He predicted that violent activists throughout the country would target the nearest avatar of the government they could find, whether that be federal courthouses or police precincts.

Julio Rosas, a national correspondent for The Blaze who has years of experience covering riots and social unrest, had a similar prediction, adding that migrants who have been let into the country under the Biden-Harris administration may join in big cities such as New York and Chicago. Above all, Rosas said protests can be expected because violent demonstrators have never learned their lesson.

“Why it’s a guarantee the left riots is because they’ve gotten away with it for so long,” Rosas told the Caller. “There hasn’t been that huge government crackdown, like January 6.”

McGinniss said he has seen the warning signs of organized protests in the event of a Trump victory. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, an influential figure among House Democrats, hasn’t committed to certifying a Trump victory, telling Axios that he would only move forward if the former president “won a free, fair and honest election.”

Such comments led McGinniss to warn that Democrats are already preparing to hit the streets, especially if the party apparatus attempts to cloud the legitimacy of Trump’s victory.

“In that case, you’d see not just pockets of rioting and stuff, but you’d see actual organized, ‘stop the steal’ style stuff,” McGinniss said.

“When that happens on the left, we all know, once the sun goes down, there’s a whole other group of people who [come out],” he added, noting that “more chaos” helps their chance at “keeping Trump out of office.”

Raskin’s comments also caught the attention of conservative election integrity advocates and Trump allies.

“It sounds like Jamie Raskin is trying to start a civil war,” Mike Davis, a Trump-aligned lawyer and founder of the Article III Project, told the Caller.

History indicates that the Raskins and rioters of the world will be egged on by corporate media.

“The Atlantic story is a great preview of what we can expect, which is pure hysteria over Trump being a fascist that’s going to use the military to force his will into existence against the American people,” The Spectator’s Washington editor Amber Duke told the Caller. Duke was previously a media reporter and then White House correspondent for the Caller.

The Atlantic story that Duke highlighted was published Tuesday by Editor-In-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who alleged that the former president praised Hitler while also disparaging a deceased veteran and her family. Instantly, the family, their lawyer and former Trump administration officials pushed back on the story, with figures close to Trump denying he had made the comments. Vice President Kamala Harris ran with it anyway, giving a rare unexpected address to push the fascism narrative. (RELATED: The Atlantic’s October Surprise On Trump Implodes After Denials Galore From Everyone Involved)

Duke believes this line of attack will intensify as critics paint the former president as a “dictator, a fascist who will never give up power.”

The Harris campaign also appears ready to engage in legal battles after the election. In August, the vice president hired back Marc Elias, one of the party’s top lawyers. In 2020, Elias played a leading role in hundreds of lawsuits seeking to make it easier to vote and undo Republican efforts to make elections more secure. He did the same in 2022, engaging in nearly 50 lawsuits in an effort to change election laws to Democrats’ liking.

In March, Republicans and their lawyers were concerned about the security of November’s election. Compared to Democrats, the Republican National Committee has been decades behind on the issue because of a 1982 consent decree that forbade them from engaging on many election integrity initiatives. But once that consent decree was lifted in 2018, the party began to rebuild, and by 2024 a fully-funded and staffed election integrity department was created. This cycle, the party has filed more than 100 election integrity lawsuits on issues ranging from removing non-citizens from voter rolls to implementing stricter checks on ballot validity.

A Trump campaign official previously told the Caller that what happened on the election integrity front in 2020 will not happen again in 2024.

Davis agreed.

“President Trump learned his lesson from 2020 … He has hired a very good legal team led by David Warrington on his campaign, along with a very good legal team led by RNC Chairman Michael Whatley,” Davis told the Caller.

Davis said the legal teams were being far more proactive in getting injunctions against Democratic initiatives this time around: “That was the mistake in 2020: they didn’t get injunctions … They’re doing it this time,” he added.

But Republicans agree that regardless of what work they do before Nov. 5, Democrats will turn to lawfare in the days and weeks thereafter if Trump prevails in the election.

“Democrats have used the claim of voter suppression to oppose every good election reform. Every reform proposed, whether it’s voter ID … cleaning up voter rolls, they always claim that’s voter suppression,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow focusing on election integrity at the Heritage Foundation, said, adding that data shows when voter ID is required, turnout goes up.



“But what I expect is that in any state where they lose, if it’s a close loss, they’re going to make general claims of voter suppression,” Hans explained.

He predicted that wherever an ID requirement was used or people were turned away from the polls, “the voter suppression claim” will be a fixture of Democrats’ post-election narrative.

To defeat Democrats in the legal arena, Davis said the key is for Trump supporters to turn out early.

The early voting blog is updated! Rs have added 2K to lead, which is now 31,000, or 5%. GOP surge slowed a bit Saturday, but Republicans still gained. Dems need to decisively win indies to make this a late Election Night. Down-ballot update, too!https://t.co/Pl43XBMcPA — Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) October 27, 2024

“Early voting is crucial because it guarantees that your voters can actually vote and don’t get disenfranchised on Election Day,” Davis explained, adding that early voting allows the Trump campaign to spend more resources on voters who haven’t turned out yet.

Duke predicted that early voting will be the crutch Democrats use to cope with a Trump victory. She explained she recently heard the argument that because journalists are reporting turnout numbers ahead of time, they are “suppressing turnout” before the election even arrives.

“I guess the Democrats are going to be against early voting because it didn’t go in their favor this time around,” Duke remarked.

Violence in the streets, a media meltdown and lawsuits would be predictable results of a second Trump victory. Security concerns may not be top of mind, but former Secret Service members said they should be.

Three months ago the former president took a shot to the head. Since then, reports have shown the Secret Service is not in a position to adequately protect him. The former agents warned that Trump could be in more danger as the 47th president than ever.

“This is uncharted territory for the Secret Service. I’ve never seen a threat landscape like we see now directed against President Trump,” former secret service agent Tim Miller told the Caller.

Miller explained that right now everyone is worried about “the guy on the roof with a rifle,” but he raised concerns about a car bomb, a plane, a biohazard attack — all things Trump could be susceptible to if the Secret Service isn’t prepared. And as of right now, he told the Caller, it seems as if they are not ready to handle the magnitude of the situation. (RELATED: Despite Skyrocketing Budget, Secret Service Can’t Seem To Find The Money To Protect The President)



“The Secret Service ought to be the most technology-savvy organization in all of government, and yet they’re 10 years behind the Department of Defense in terms of drone technology,” Miller told the Caller.

Miller compared agents’ lack of experience with drone technology at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania rally to a pro football team showing up to a game without a ball.

Miller made it clear that he didn’t fault the officers themselves for being ill-prepared, rather he saw the leadership to blame.

Rich Staropoli, a former Secret Service agent, told the Caller that Trump’s high-profile family and global threats will bring additional security concerns not considered under the Biden administration. The biggest issue, however, is the agency’s lack of ability to retain officers.

“When I was there, we never had a problem going to other federal agencies and saying, ‘hey, we need a dozen guys. We need 50 guys,'” Staropoli told the Caller, adding that help was provided and legalities were sorted out later.

“Where’s the hesitancy in doing that? But it’s obvious it isn’t being done. That’s a problem,” Staropoli continued.

There is one other person to consider in the aftermath of the Nov. 5 election: Kamala Harris.

Democrats have rallied behind Harris in 2024 after a tumultuous term as vice president. Her future in Democratic politics could rest in the balance of Nov. 5’s results.

“They would not be happy to lose, but either outcome would be fine to them,” Duke told the Caller. “On one hand, they win, and on the other they get rid of Kamala.”
Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson took aim at the Democratic Party during Sunday’s Trump rally, confidently declaring his belief that the former president will win the 2024 election in under 10 days.

Thousands of Trump supporters flooded the typically liberal city on Sunday afternoon, filling Madison Square Garden to kick off the campaign’s final week before Election Day. Joining a lineup of Republican figures like businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Democrat Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard — Carlson took the stage, quickly voicing his confidence in a Trump victory.

” … That’s Donald Trump, back in the city that produced him with no embarrassment at all in a room full of his friends. The stones that takes, the bravery that takes is incredible. Donald Trump’s gonna win. He’s gonna win. I know that that’s true,” Carlson said.

“The people he’s about to defeat have no idea and they’re panicked,” Carlson added. “They have no idea why, people like Donald Trump, and their first theory was, ‘Well, Donald Trump is evil, so half the country’s evil also,’ and that’s one of the reasons they spent the last four years trying to destroy the country, because they’re mad at its voters for liking Donald Trump.”

Carlson continued to call out Democrats’ confusion over voter support for Trump, noting two reasons the former president is popular: his genuine “affection” for voters and the “liberation” he believes Trump has brought to Americans. Carlson argued that, through this liberation, voters have started to see through the “lies” of the Democratic Party, pointing to what he claims is their biggest lie — convincing others they’re “impressive.” (RELATED: What Happens If Trump Wins?)

” … But the big lie, you know what the big lie is? The big lie is that they’re impressive. That’s what the big lie is. That the people in charge have somehow earned the right to rule over you and they haven’t. And you know that. These are the single most useless people in the United States. They have no skills whatsoever. They’ve got three quarters of the money, and they didn’t earn it,” Carlson said.

WATCH:

“They set up a system precisely for the purpose of awarding themselves wealth and power when it’s undeserved. You look at Liz Cheney and you ask yourself, honestly, what skill could she possibly have that allowed her to send hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths? Did she earn that?” Carlson asked. “I don’t think she did. No fair system would make Liz Cheney powerful. No fair system would make Larry Fink rich. No fair system would elevate someone like Kamala Harris to a presidential nomination.”

Carlson then stated that by sticking with the party, Trump has inspired Republicans to “call bs” on the “charade” of the Democratic Party. The DCNF co-founder noted that as more people come forward to openly support Trump, it will become harder for voters to believe Harris could win.

“What’s embarrassing is to take a perfectly great country and destroy it as they have … It’s going to be pretty tough for them,” Carlson said. “Ten days from now, to look in the eye to America with a straight face, it’s gonna be pretty hard to look at us and say, ‘You know what? Kamala Harris, she’s just got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive as the first Samoan Malaysian low IQ, former California prosecutor, ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support, and anyone who thinks otherwise just a freak or a criminal.'”

“At this stage of the game, after nine years of listening to their lies and finding every single one of them totally false. No, it’s not safe and effective and no, she’s not impressive,” Carlson added. “It’s very hard for me to believe the rest of us are going to say, ‘You know what? Joe Scarborough, you’re right, you’re right. She won fair and square because she’s just so impressive.’ I don’t think so.”

Carlson concluded by calling this new defiance a liberation and a freedom “to say what’s obviously true,” expressing gratitude to Donald Trump for it.

Trump took the stage last in the evening, greeted by a roaring crowd, and spoke for roughly an hour to supporters. The former president focused on his policy platform, addressing top voter concerns about the economy, inflation and immigration. He encouraged the crowd to vote and noted that Republicans could take both the Senate and House — hinting at an unreleased plan he has discussed with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to secure Congress.

First went the Los Angeles Times, then the Washington Post. They wouldn’t be making a presidential endorsement this election. The Times’ owner made the decision over the objections of the editorial board. The Post’s publisher delivered the decision, reportedly over the objections of the whole staff.

The brouhaha exposes a lot: first, just how incredibly out of touch these people are; and second, what’s coming if Vice President Kamala Harris loses in eight days.

Reporters and writers are as committed as ever — and willing to leak on their bosses, attack their publications, and resign for their cause.

Let’s start with the self-awareness — a quality notable lacking in American media. And we can begin that with a look at the victims here. Can you imagine, for a moment, those poor people who won’t know how to vote now? Who might not know what the L.A. Times editorial staff thought about former President Donald Trump? I mean, we know one of their number was so traumatized because a Trump-supporting neighbor plowed her driveway for free that she wrote a whole column on her moral conundrum, but that wasn’t explicit enough for us.

Former WaPo executive editor Marty Baron said it best, calling the paper’s decision not to endorse “cowardice” and “a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty.”

The whole thing is preposterous. It’s unlikely that anyone outside the newspaper staffs themselves even noticed the papers hadn’t made their endorsements before they announced they would not be making any. If the last eight years have exposed anything, though, it’s the American media’s incredibly propensity to make it about themselves. When Trump first won, their time spent wondering why their countrymen chose him over Her was fleeting at best. Instead, they switched gears to what they had done wrong and how they had made it all happen. Even their introspection is just thinly disguised self-regard.

Since those heady days, it’s only gotten worse. World War II fantasies play out in their heads, starring them as the romanticized heroes of Le Resistance. They may wear COVID masks instead of balaclavas, and in reality, they might be the team that turns local priests over to the authorities for wrongthink, but in their heads they are fighting Adolf Hitler reincarnate.

The childish fantasies don’t end there, however. These folks think they’re needed. The internal freakouts at the L.A. Times and Washington Post led to public resignations. Raise your hand if you think any publisher wants an unemployed L.A. Times editorial writer who publicly criticized her paper and its publisher. Any takers? Anyone?

Sure, they were the toast of the childless cat ladies at last weekend’s dinner party, but glory is fleeting — vainglory, more so. The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin encapsulates the true Democrat appreciation of the sacrifice perfectly: She cheered on the resignations at the L.A. Times, even wondering why there weren’t more. Then, when her own paper followed suit the next day, she stayed put. Even when Washington Post editor at large Robert Kagan left and did his little weekend media tour all about it, she held on to her job. Maybe she’ll resign yet, but chicken hawks rarely change their feathers.

If any of these people had learned a thing these past eight years, it should have been that it is not our role to tell people what to think. Americans don’t like it, and when we decide to ignore that and tell them what to think anyway, they don’t listen. In 2015 we didn’t know that. The American press still believed it enjoyed the prestige and influence it had inherited. In 2024, there’s no excuse for not knowing it.

The first clear sign was National Review, a then-60-year-old magazine that, through the omnipresent efforts of its founder and longtime editor William F. Buckley, Jr., had been the mighty flagship of conservative media, deciding the contours and specifics of who was acceptable and who would be exiled. Buckley’s successors believed they still possessed his authority, and as Trump’s eventual nomination loomed ever more likely, they decided a demonstration of that authority was in order.

The big purple and gold issue “Against Trump” featured a dozen of the top names in conservative media. The authors, publishers, and assorted luminaries may have imagined themselves a glorious cavalry charging the enemy to the cheers of the peasantry. Instead, they were revealed to be modern Don Quixotes: impotent and more than a little silly.

The full might of a once-mighty magazine was concentrated and fired ... and had no effect. The episode served as an object lesson on modern realities to anyone paying attention. Many of the men and women featured on the cover would come to recognize this and learn from it. Few in corporate left-wing media joined them.

While this industry-wide effort was successful in hobbling his first administration, it’s done little to hinder Trump’s long-term success — and much to squander the remaining credibility the press still enjoyed. Even as reporters upped their rhetoric, committing more and more fully to their new roles resisting Trump, his popularity continued to climb. Today, after nearly a decade of virtually universal negative coverage, his approval rating sits as high as it’s ever sat. Still, Democratic journalists remain blind to their limits.

This story of the media’s collapse, however, isn’t over — and last week’s episodes give us a good glimpse of what will come if the 45th president returns to office. Even while owners and publishers are growing sick of their reporters’ and writers’ unending tantrums, the reporters and writers themselves are as committed as ever — and willing to leak on their bosses, attack their publications, and resign for their cause.

If in eight days Donald J. Trump overcomes being impeached, unelected, legally persecuted, relentlessly smeared, nearly assassinated (twice!), and massively outspent to win the 2024 presidential election, there won’t be any introspection in the ranks of Democrat media. There will be civil war.

The fire rises: The New York Times: In a first among Christians, young men are more religious than young women

Christianity is under threat from within. Decades of “feminized sentimentality” had driven young men away, and study after study shows children are more likely to be religious if their fathers practiced the faith than if the source of religion is their mother. The recognition of this and the work to return to more traditional roots have begun to change things. It’s on display in my home parish, as well as those I visit. It’s on display across the country, too. Ruth Graham reports:

The dynamics at Grace are a dramatic example of an emerging truth: For the first time in modern American history, young men are now more religious than their female peers. They attend services more often and are more likely to identify as religious.



“We’ve never seen it before,” Ryan Burge, an associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University, said of the flip.



Among Generation Z Christians, this dynamic is playing out in a stark way: The men are staying in church, while the women are leaving at a remarkable clip.



... Young men have different concerns. They are less educated than their female peers. In major cities, including New York and Washington, they earn less.



At the same time, they place a higher value on traditional family life. Childless young men are likelier than childless young women to say they want to become parents someday, by a margin of 12 percentage points, according to a survey last year by Pew. The young men at Grace and Hope churches “are looking for leadership, they’re looking for clarity, they’re looking for meaning,” said Bracken Arnhart, a Hope Church pastor.



He added, “There are guys that are just hungry.”



This growing gender divide has the potential to reshape the landscape of not just religion, but also of family life and politics. In a Times/Siena poll of six swing states in August, young men favored former President Donald J. Trump by 13 points, while young women favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 38 points — a 51-point gap far larger than in other generational cohorts.



Hear more on the subject from the "Blaze News Tonight" team in the video below:
Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik said Monday that Republican nominee Donald Trump is leading in all of the swing congressional districts that President Joe Biden won by landslides in the 2020 election.

Trump has made inroads with New York’s electorate, especially among black, Hispanic and young voters, resulting in a narrower lead for Vice President Kamala Harris in comparison to President Joe Biden’s in 2020, according to a The New York Times/Siena College survey. Stefanik said on Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria Bartiromo” that the former president’s “historical support” in swing districts will help hold the Republican majority in the House.

“New York has decayed under the weaponization of Alvin Bragg, [Letisha] James and the horrible leadership of [Governor] Kathy Hochul. You have the crime crisis, the illegal migrant crisis right here, so it is the epicenter of just the far-left radical failed Democrat policies and President Trump has earned historic support,” Stefanik said. “Do you know in every single swing congressional district, Maria, President Trump is winning. These are districts that Joe Biden won by 15 points in some cases in 2020, President Trump is now polling ahead, which is why the telephone rally he did the night before to a million voters across key congressional districts in New York, he knows that the House majority will run right through New York, but this is a growing Republican Party, a historic Republican Party in support of President Trump.”

WATCH:

Stefanik said Trump’s gains among black, Hispanic and Jewish voters across the state could lead to historic victories for Republicans, which has caused Harris and other “desperate” Democrats to equate Trump to former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. (RELATED: Trump Leading Harris In All Major Swing-State Polling Averages As Campaign Hits Home Stretch)

“The highest rate of African American voters [are] supporting President Trump. The most significant Hispanic American voters supporting President Trump, the highest percentage,” Stefanik said. “Working class Americans, Jewish voters, I mean, this is like the big tent party. Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton are so desperate that they’re calling him fascist and Hitler. It’s a disgrace, the American people are smart, but we have to get out the vote to get this done.”

Harris leads Trump in New York 66% to 27%, a significantly lower margin than Biden’s 76% to 23% victory against the former president in 2020, according to The New York Times. These numbers represent the worst results for a Democratic candidate in the state since 1988.

Democrats also fared worse in the 2022 midterm elections by only winning the state’s popular vote by 9 points, while Biden won the popular vote by 23 points, according to the Times.

The former president held a gigantic rally at Madison Square Garden with a sellout crowd, which included key speakers such as tech billionaire Elon Musk, former First Lady Melania Trump and Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson.

The Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) weaponized the agency against Elon Musk’s Twitter, according to a House Judiciary report provided exclusively to the Daily Caller.

Biden-appointed FTC Chair Lina Khan introduced a consent decree against the platform due to Musk’s acquisition, according to the report, although Khan denied that was the reason. However, the FTC was considering potentially enforcing the consent decree in the years preceding Musk’s acquisition – but Khan “called for an immediate vote” days after the deal was announced, documents show.

The House Judiciary Committee received more than a dozen letters the FTC sent to Twitter during the first three months of Musk’s acquisition. The FTC used the letters to institute over 350 demands for information and documents from the company, including demands that were outside the FTC’s consent decree, according to the report. (RELATED: Democrats Forecast Plan To Go After High-Profile Trump Supporters, Starting With Elon Musk)

House Judiciary Chairman @Jim_Jordan has subpoenaed FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan for harassing Twitter following Elon Musk’s acquisition. pic.twitter.com/n45lBlzlxN — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) April 12, 2023

A consent decree is a court-approved settlement agreement, according to Cornell Law School.

The agency uses consent decrees to “settle claims of wrongdoing and impose specific requirements on a company,” according to the Committee. Once a company has entered a consent decree, FTC lawyers can demand information from it.

The consent decree was in progress for three years, according to the report.

In October 2019, Twitter self-reported a violation of its consent decree with the FTC, the Committee said. Twitter and the FTC agreed to a tentative settlement in March 2021 regarding the FTC’s privacy and security concerns, but then-Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter did not finalize the decree. When Khan took over in June 2021, she directed staff to restart the negotiations. In March 2022, Twitter and the FTC agreed to a nearly identical consent decree as the agreement in 2021. (RELATED: Elon Musk Takes Important Scalp In War On Censorship)

It was not until Twitter had announced Musk intended to acquire the company that Khan demanded an “immediate vote to finalize the settlement,” the report noted. The Committee alleges in its report that the FTC “weaponized its regulatory authority” against Twitter and Musk.

FTC Commissioners Push Back

The FTC traditionally lets commissioners and staff review the evidence prior to voting on a consent decree, and Republican Commissioners requested access to the recommendation memorandum and decree proposal – but did not receive either, according to the report.

Khan accelerated the vote without letting commissioners take the necessary time to review the evidence, the committee asserted.

The attorney advisor for Republican Commissioner Noah Philips emailed Chair Khan’s attorney advisor asking why Khan was rushing the vote. Philips had repeatedly requested access to a recommendation memo.

“Given that this matter has been open for quite a while, what’s the urgency?” The attorney advisor inquired.

“Commissioner Phillips has been very interested in seeing this [recommendation] package and has been regularly asking about it in his meetings with [the Bureau of Consumer Protection], so he’d like to understand the issues that require an accelerated review. It’s an important case and he will want time to get any questions he might have answered and give it thoughtful consideration.” (RELATED: ‘Threat To The First Amendment’: Jim Jordan Grills Biden’s FTC Chair On ‘Harassment’ Of Twitter)

Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson’s attorney advisor echoed Phillips’ concerns, noting that Wilson desired “sufficient time” to go over the material.

“The urgency is due to Elon Musk’s purchase of the company this week,” Khan’s advisor replied in a group email.

Phillips’ attorney advisor requested elaboration on the matter, but the Chair’s office only repeated that the matter was urgent, according to the report.

Wilson’s attorney advisor sent an email expressing the need for the traditional three weeks.

“This is an important matter for the Commission and she wants sufficient time to review it carefully and discuss with staff,” the adviser wrote.

The FTC declined to comment, but pointed the Caller to a letter from Chair Khan.

Despite these requests, however, the FTC voted to accept the consent decree in less than three weeks and referred it to the Department of Justice (DOJ) which filed it in federal court, the report said. The consent decree went into effect on May 26.

Chair Khan, according to the Committee, routinely claimed that the vote’s timing was due to the company and not the FTC. She also claimed the vote’s expedition was not because of Musk’s intention to acquire the company.

As the attorney advisor’s email demonstrates, however, Elon’s Musk’s acquisition was precisely the reason for the rushed vote – and Chair Khan has yet to provide any evidence to the contrary, according to the Committee.

Khan relayed to the Committee that the expedited vote was at Twitter’s request, according to documents. (RELATED: Biden FTC Chair Suffers Major Losses After Picking Fight With Big Tech)

“…Twitter’s counsel urged the Commission to approve the order expeditiously, to resolve the outstanding issues in the interest of facilitating the acquisition and change in ownership to proceed smoothly,” a letter from Khan to the Committee states.

The FTC did not provide the Committee with any documents showing that Twitter’s outside council was in direct communication with Khan’s office about the FTC vote, the report shows. FTC documents reveal Khan’s support for rushing the vote came prior to Twitter’s request to finalize the revised consent decree, the Committee added.

A Pretext For ‘Harassing’ Musk And Twitter

The report asserts that Khan’s FTC began “harassing” Twitter once the consent decree was approved.

Khan reportedly refused a meeting with Musk until Twitter adhered to all of the agency’s demands. Twitter’s attorneys, according to the report, noted that not all communications regarding Musk “could reasonably contain information about Twitter’s data security and privacy program.”

The FTC failed to explain why it was requiring Twitter to produce these communications, according to the report.

“The only reasonable explanation, then, for requiring all communications remotely related to Musk would be as a tool for the FTC to harass Musk,” the Committee said.

The FTC’s leadership assisted in investigations of Twitter, according to documents reviewed by the Committee. James Kohm, a Bureau of Consumer Protection staffer, received an email claiming that Khan “praised [the Twitter] team’s assertiveness and momentum in its Twitter investigation” and added that “it would be helpful for [the Twitter] team to connect with [the Bureau of Competition.]” (RELATED: George Soros Among Liberal Billionaires Bankrolling Groups Tied To Top Biden Regulator)

The Biden-Harris FTC also demanded information that was outside the consent decree’s purview, the Committee claimed. Despite protests from Twitter’s attorneys, the FTC continued to require that the company produce all communications pertaining to Elon Musk.

The FTC reportedly refused to “clarify” why the requested information was relevant, according to the report.

Additionally, the FTC considered using Twitter’s divulgence of information to journalists as a means of circumventing Twitter’s “privilege claim” for keeping documents from the agency.

TWITTER AND “OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES” — Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) December 24, 2022



“We probably need to press further on understanding with greater certainty and detail exactly what types of access Musk is granting outside journalists, both as a potential argument about their privilege waiver and also as a basic privacy/security access issue…” an FTC staffer wrote on Dec. 12, 2022.

If Twitter’s privilege claims were voided, then the FTC would be able to obtain information about the journalists who revealed the Biden-Harris administration’s censorship in the “Twitter Files,” according to the report.

Musk allowed journalists to reveal the role the Biden-Harris administration had in pressuring Big Tech to censor online speech, the Committee detailed. (Stream the Daily Callers documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

In 2023, Twitter Files journalists Michael Shellenberger and Matt Taibbi testified to the House Select Subcommittee on Weaponization about how the federal government pressured tech companies to censor speech – and how that censorship was election interference.

Khan said the FTC needed to investigate Twitter’s compliance with the decree because the information Musk provided to the journalists involved in exposing the Twitter Files “triggered legal scrutiny,” the report states.

However, the FTC eventually discovered that measures were taken by the company to protect consumer privacy, and so the FTC’s investigation was no longer necessary. The agency seemingly closed its investigation into the company this early in 2024, the report shows.

The Committee also claims that Khan was uncooperative and “refused to produce key documents.” (RELATED: ‘Mafia Tactics’: GOP Rep Grills Merrick Garland For DOJ Choosing To Investigate Elon Musk, But Not Mark Zuckerberg)

The Biden-Harris FTC, under the leadership of Chair Khan, expedited the consent decree to “punish” Musk and his company for revealing the administration’s censorship, the report concluded.

The Caller previously reported how the Twitter Files exposed the FBI’s efforts to work with Big Tech to crack down on speech around the time of the 2020 presidential election.

The FBI reportedly told Twitter it would be the “belly button” for intelligence agency requests to Big Tech, documents revealed last year. Matt Taibi reported that an FBI agent asked former Twitter Head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth about monthly calls between Big Tech and intelligence agencies.
As the Nov. 5 Election Day approaches, the threat of illegal voting by noncitizens looms large. Democrats say that’s impossible, because it’s “already illegal for noncitizens to vote.” Yes. It is. And bank robbery, exceeding the speed limit, murder, and crossing the U.S. border without proper documentation — all of those things are “already illegal,” and yet people do those things anyway.

Federal statutes are responsible for much of the chaos when it comes to ensuring that only U.S. citizens vote in our elections. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) was construed by the U.S. Supreme Court more than a decade ago to preclude states from requiring documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote using the federal voter registration form (which all but six states are required to “accept and use”).

The Biden-Harris Department of Justice is now suing Alabama and Virginia for removing noncitizens from the states’ voter rolls, citing (wrongly) the NVRA’s list maintenance provisions as prohibiting the removal of noncitizen registrations in the 90 days preceding an election. The DOJ is wrong on the law because the NVRA was not intended to apply to registrations that were never valid in the first place. The administration’s lawsuits merely confirm that Democrats view illegals and noncitizens as a key component of their political base.

It is not just the NVRA that is problematic: the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires states to confirm the identity and residency of any applicant seeking to register to vote in any state. Notice anything missing in that list? How about confirming an applicant’s U.S. citizenship status? That was not included in the law passed by Congress in 2002 because no one could have imagined a day in the future when an administration would adopt a “whole of government” policy that ignores the nation’s immigration laws and rewards those who come across the borders illegally.

The two methods prescribed by HAVA for verification of identity and residency are a driver’s license or a Social Security number, both of which are issued to noncitizens and neither of which confirm citizenship status. Every state issues driver’s licenses to noncitizens, and 19 states issue driver’s licenses to illegals. Couple that with the Biden-Harris administration’s current efforts to push millions of illegals into categories of persons eligible for Social Security numbers, and one realizes that HAVA has no provisions to review or confirm citizenship status of voter registration applicants.

The third federal law that is being exploited by Democrats and their leftist allies is the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which was enacted to make it easier for active-duty military members and their families to vote, regardless of where in the world they were stationed. Over time, however, UOCAVA has completely morphed from its original purpose of facilitating military voting. In the 2020 presidential election, 63 percent of the UOCAVA votes were from civilians, not members of the military.

In addition, many state election officials have failed to ensure that basic UOCAVA eligibility requirements are met. For instance, in North Carolina UOCAVA voters must show some prior relationship to the state, and the law directs the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) to modify or create a declaration attesting to the voter’s eligibility to vote under UOCAVA. But the NCSBE has not complied with that directive, and there is no verification of citizenship or the eligibility of a person to vote in North Carolina via UOCAVA. The North Carolina practice is not unusual or unique.

In Pennsylvania, election officials have contended that there is no requirement to validate eligibility or identity before registering UOCAVA voters in their state, which directly contradicts both federal and state law.

These are not insignificant threats to the integrity and validity of the 2024 general election. Democrats are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to gather UOCAVA registrations and votes from people living in countries all over the world, regardless of whether they can prove their citizenship status or their eligibility to vote in a particular state. Why? Because in recent presidential elections, the civilian overseas votes have largely benefited Democrats.

Clearly, changes in federal and state laws are necessary to protect our elections from being overrun with ineligible votes cast by noncitizens who have made their way onto state voter rolls because of these problematic federal laws.

Congress took the first major step this year to address the crisis of noncitizen voting in U.S. elections when Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced the Save American Voter Eligibility Act (“SAVE Act”), which was embraced and endorsed by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La. Johnson made passage of the SAVE Act a top priority and helped push the bill through the House, which passed on July 10, 2024, with all Republicans and five Democrats voting aye.

Johnson then made another valiant effort in September to pass the SAVE Act as part of a six-month continuing resolution for temporary funding of the federal government. Unfortunately, several Republican House members could not get past themselves (and, in some cases, their own personal issues) to realize the urgent need to support Johnson’s plan to pass the combined measure in the House and force Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to explain to the American people why he and his Democrat colleagues oppose keeping noncitizens from voting in U.S. elections.

House members who voted against the Speaker’s proposal, even some members I normally respect, were a terrible disappointment. They utterly failed the country when they killed the CR+SAVE Act, not only because it was good policy, but also because it denied us the opportunity to make noncitizen voting a key differentiating topic for the national election conversation this fall.

Those members offered a variety of excuses, all of which I found to be feeble. But the most irritating excuses came from members who simply oppose continuing resolutions “on principle,” no matter what. That reminds me of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay on self-reliance, in which he wrote that ”a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.”

It is virtually impossible to move forward when members of your own team insist on putting themselves and their own self-importance above the greater good and the vital need to address a serious national threat.

Congress has work to do next year, and my hope is that Speaker Johnson will have an expanded majority to help repair the damage to America’s elections caused by the language and loopholes in these flawed federal laws.

Noncitizens should have no voice or vote in U.S. elections — any of them. It is well past time for Congress to fix the problems it has created over the past 30 years. I am praying that those statutory loopholes do not cost America a lawful election on Nov. 5 by allowing U.S. citizens’ votes to be diluted and overwhelmed by the votes of people who should have no say in our elections.

Democrats are fighting to make elections less secure in multiple key states just days before the Nov. 5 election.

Election legislation has already been a focal point of the 2024 campaign, especially as the Republican National Committee (RNC) beefs up its election integrity department, but the battles are set to continue beyond Nov. 5. In the weeks leading up to the election, Democrats have signed legislation prohibiting voter identification while Biden-Harris’s Department of Justice has sued Alabama and Virginia for attempting to take illegal immigrants off their voter rolls.

“What’s so bizarre about that lawsuit, the two lawsuits that DOJ has filed … that is the exact opposite of what DOJ should be doing, it is a criminal violation of federal – in fact, it’s a felony for an alien to register to vote,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow focusing on election integrity at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Watch The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Rigged’)

“And so what the DOJ ought to be doing is going to Virginia and saying, ‘can you please give me the files of each of these voters so we can investigate and potentially prosecute them?’ And no, instead, they’re saying, ‘no, you have to keep on the voter rolls aliens who are breaking federal law,'” von Spakovsky continued.

In August, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order to make the state more frequently remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. The DOJ then moved to sue the state on Oct. 12, alleging that the Virginia State Board of Elections had violated the federal National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which states that voter rolls may not be cleaned up 90 days before an election. Biden’s DOJ further claimed that the executive order, signed 90 days out from Nov. 5, produced a “systemic removal” which can apparently cause voters to be confused and affect eligible voters. (RELATED: GOP States Remove Thousands Of Noncitizens Off Voting Rolls As Election Day Nears)

Similarly, Alabama was sued by the Biden-Harris DOJ after Secretary of State Wes Allen identified 3,251 registered voters that had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security and sought to remove them from the rolls. The DOJ alleged that, like in Virginia, it was too close to election day.

“The right to vote is one of the most sacred rights in our democracy,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “As Election Day approaches, it is critical that Alabama redress voter confusion resulting from its list maintenance mailings sent in violation of federal law.”

In Virginia’s case, Biden-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles issued an order blocking Virginia’s efforts to remove the estimated 1,600 individuals that the state believes have “self-identified” as noncitizens. On Sunday, the Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he would be filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in response.

A Trump-appointed judge sided with the DOJ in Alabama and ordered the state restore the voters who they had taken off the voter rolls as a result of Allen’s order.

In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott previously announced that his administration had purged more than 6,500 noncitizens from state voter rolls. The cleaning of the voter rolls is a result of a 2021 bill Abbott signed into law which instated numerous election security measures like uniform statewide voting hours, banned drive-through voting and gave more power to poll watchers.

“I was surprised they haven’t sued Texas yet. Texas also announced that he did take 6,500 aliens off the voter roll. I’m expecting Texas will get sued by DOJ also,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law on Sept. 29 that prohibits local governments from requiring identification to vote. The legislation was brought forward by Democratic state Sen. Dave Min after a ballot measure was presented in Huntington Beach that would require identification at the polls, according to Politico.

“Forbidding, actually forbidding it. The state has no ID requirement, and yet, when one town said, ‘Well, we really want to do this,’ they pass a law preventing that from happening. In general, every time states have tried to clean up their voter lists to take off people who have died and moved away, Democrats sue them so they want inaccurate voter lists,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

About a week out from the election, political experts have started to discuss what the aftermath of a Trump victory could look like. From protests, to lawfare, to security concerns, the Daily Caller spoke to a variety of experts who predicted a dangerous and extreme response from Democrats if Trump wins. (RELATED: What Happens If Trump Wins?)

Von Spakovsky told the Caller he expects Democrats to claim voter suppression through lawsuits following a Trump victory. Mike Davis, a Trump-aligned lawyer and founder of the Article III Project, explained that even if Democrats prepare to sue, the state of election integrity is not close to what it was in 2024.

“President Trump learned his lesson from 2020 … He has hired a very good legal team led by David Warrington on his campaign, along with a very good legal team led by RNC Chairman Michael Whatley,” Davis told the Caller.

“That was the mistake in 2020: they didn’t get injunctions … They’re doing it this time,” Davis added, explaining that the RNC legal team has been far more proactive in the 2024 election cycle.
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said former President Donald Trump will move quickly to tighten laws against illegal immigration if he wins the White House.

The No. 2 House Republican leader told Fox News Digital that he met with Trump earlier this year at Mar-a-Lago, where the two discussed priorities for the first 100 days of a new administration – provided the GOP sweeps Congress and the White House.

Among the priorities, in addition to economic and energy initiatives, is the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.

"President Trump can do a number of things on his own that he has talked about," Scalise said Friday.

He said Trump would likely reinstate his Migrant Protection Protocols, better known as the "Remain in Mexico" policy, which forced asylum-seekers to wait on the Mexican side of the U.S. southwestern border while their cases were being adjudicated. Multiple human rights groups have criticized the policy as inhumane, and the Biden administration dropped it in 2021.

Scalise also expects Trump to cease all "catch-and-release" policies at the border.

"We know that it's causing crime problems in every community, drug problems, the fentanyl that the drug cartels are bringing in," Scalise said.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS ‘LACK OF LEADERSHIP’ IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

A Republican-majority Congress would support Trump’s crackdown, he said, noting Capitol Hill’s role in funding federal projects and programs.

"Things like building more wall – that's something we worked with President Trump to do. We built over 500 miles of wall. Joe Biden ended that on day one," Scalise said.

"We also want to fund some more tools for our Border Patrol agents, things like drone capabilities, night vision, so that they can do an even better job of managing the border."

Other first 100-day priorities include rolling back electric vehicle mandates and setting new tax policy – with key provisions in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire in 2025.

However, the Louisiana Republican was careful not to over-project confidence in the closing days of the election. He noted that the House majority would likely come down to 40 to 45 key races out of 435 and that a GOP majority would likely be a slim four to 10 seats.

"These aren't the days where you can have a 30-seat majority anymore because of redistricting and the way it's really narrowed the map," he said. "But at the same time, I mean, today we have a four-seat majority. We had actually dropped down to a one-seat majority earlier this year. So, you know, if we're able to get it up close to double digits, that would really be a great night for us."

Scalise himself has put in hundreds of miles on the road in support of Republican candidates.

He raised $70 million this election cycle, with $15 million given to the House GOP campaign arm and $10.4 million to 206 individual candidates and incumbents.

Scalise’s political team said he has visited at least 140 different districts to campaign for the 2024 cycle.

In October alone, the month before Election Day, Scalise held 66 events across 28 states.

Should Democrats win the House majority, however, Scalise – the longest-serving member of House GOP leadership – insisted he had no interest in challenging House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., as the top House Republican.

When asked if he would entertain a bid for minority leader against Johnson if colleagues asked him to, Scalise firmly answered, "No."

"We're not talking about what happens if we lose the majority, because all of my focus is on not only winning the majority, but gaining seats. And anybody who's thinking about losing or anything like that is just misplaced in their focus," he said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.
Former President Trump took the stage at his historic Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday evening, where thousands of supporters from the deep-blue Northeast state cheered wildly as the 45th president railed against Biden-Harris administration policies and vowed to "Make America great again."

Trump took the stage at Madison Square Garden just after 7 p.m. in the packed stadium, where he focused his speech on spiraling immigration, inflation woes and looking toward the future with lower consumer costs and securing the border. The rally was first-come, first-serve and sold out within hours of being announced this month. Madison Square Garden has a capacity of 19,500 people.

"I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer," Trump told the crowds as he spoke about the illegal immigration crisis since 2021.

"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, going to kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is equally vicious, I will invoke the Alien Enemies act of 1798," he said.

ELON MUSK, DANA WHITE TO APPEAR AT 'HISTORIC' TRUMP MSG RALLY

Trump said Harris was behind "the most egregious betrayal" of any U.S. leader due to immigration policies under the Biden-Harris administration.

"Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens," he said.

The 45th president said that if he's re-elected, he will also immediately ban sanctuary cities across the nation.

The massive rally, where nearly 200,000 people tried to gain access, according to Donald Trump Jr., included a handful of high-profile speakers ahead of Trump's remarks, including an address from former first lady Melania Trump.

TRUMP AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN: ICONIC VENUE HAS PLAYED HOST TO MANY CAMPAIGN GATHERINGS NEAR ELECTION DAY

"Envision a wonderful America where the seeds of security, prosperity and health are so and once again for the benefit of our families," Melania Trump said before introducing her husband. "Let us start together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let's seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve. And now."

Other notable speakers at Trump's rally included House Speaker Mike Johnson, pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, tech billionaire Elon Musk, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, and TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw.

Trump's speech included a focus on the economy and spiraling inflation and "bringing back the American dream," including vowing to the audience that he will cut their energy costs in half by January 2026 if he's elected.

TRUMP PREPS FOR MASSIVE CAMPAIGN RALLY SUNDAY AT NEW YORK CITY'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

"I will terminate the ‘green new scam.’ And we'll cut your energy prices in half, 50%, within one year from Jan. 20th. Is the fake news hearing that?" he said before directing the audience to the "fake news media" at the rally.

Trump touted that if he wins the election next week, he will lower costs for consumers as well as end taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.

"We will rapidly defeat inflation, and we will very simply make America affordable again. We're going to make it affordable. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips. No tax on overtime. And no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors," he said.

Trump added that under his leadership, the Republican Party has become the "party of inclusion."

ELON MUSK COMES OUT IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP IN 'DARK GOTHIC MAGA' AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

"Jews and Muslims and Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons, and they're all joining our cause in large numbers, larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before, larger than they've ever seen in any country," he said.

"And we're a big, powerful party, and they're losing it. They're really losing it. Together we will lift America to glory beyond your wildest dreams. It's going to happen fast, too."

Kennedy, who ran for president as a Democrat before endorsing Trump in August, railed against the Democratic Party for morphing into a party he no longer recognizes.

"The Democratic Party is the party of war. It's the party of the CIA. You had Kamala Harris giving a speech at the Democratic convention that was written by neocons. It was belligerent, pugnacious. It talked about domination of the world by the United States through our weapons of war. It's the party today that wants to divide Americans. It's a party that is dismantling women's sports by letting men play women's sports," he said.

TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY AT NEW YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY

"It's the party of Wall Street. It's the party of Bill Gates, who just gave $50 million to Harris. It's the party, and the Harris campaign is very proud that it received the endorsement of 50 former CIA agents and officers and of John Bolton and of Dick Cheney."

Musk wore his all-black MAGA hat during the rally, which he called "dark gothic MAGA," and vowed to cut government spending if Trump secures the election and appoints Musk to the administration as "Secretary of Cost-Cutting."

Trump had teased for months that he would hold a rally at Madison Square Garden and officially announced the event earlier in October.

"This is going to be an iconic, historic day, and you can see it's already full. I mean, it's amazing. These tickets sold out in less than three hours. And it shows the enthusiasm, the momentum, the energy as we are in this closing chapter of an unbelievable campaign," New York Rep. Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital ahead of the rally, saying New York is in play for the Trump campaign.

Fox News Digital spoke to attendees outside the arena, who said they are "excited" to see Trump at home in New York City and that many New Yorkers are ready to pull the lever for the GOP ticket next week.

"Absolutely," Westchester native Alexa Brink told Fox News Digital when asked if other New Yorkers she knows will vote for Trump. "All day long; let's go Trump! " She added that she wasn't sure if Trump could win New York, "but we'll try!"

Another rally-goer named Anas Shuaib said that on Nov. 5 voters will tell Harris: "You're fired."

"I'm an Arab American, Muslim American, and I'm voting for Trump because just like Kamala kicked out that Muslim at the rally, Ahmed Ghanim, we're going to kick her out of the White House. And when Trump becomes president, there's going to be peace, there's going to be prosperity, and America first … no one else first," he said.

Trump said during the rally that he will have the "biggest victory in the history of our country in November."

"We're running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala. And far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today's Democrat Party. They're just vessels. In fact, they're perfect vessels because they'll never give them a hard time. They'll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It's just this amorphous group of people. But they're smart, and they're vicious, and we have to defeat them," he said.

"We're going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on Nov. 5, and it's going to be the biggest victory in history. We're going to make America great again."
Mass deportations could be performed without separating families if families are deported together, Fox News contributor Tom Homan said during an interview on CBS's "60 Minutes."

Homan served as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a portion of former President Donald Trump's administration.

Trump, who is currently aiming to win the 2024 presidential election so he can return to the White House next year, has said that he would pursue the "largest mass deportation in" U.S. history.

SCALISE DETAILS TRUMP'S VISION ON SECURING BORDER IN FIRST 100 DAYS

Journalist Cecilia Vega asked Homan whether it's possible to perform mass deportations without splitting up families.

"Families can be deported together," Homan answered.

When Vega asked why an American child should have to relocate to another country, Homan pointed out that the parent illegally entered the U.S. and had a child while in the nation unlawfully, and that the parent "created that crisis."

OBAMA-ERA DHS SECRETARY ARGUES HARRIS WILL BE ‘TOUGHER’ ON THE BORDER THAN BIDEN

Homan rejected the notion that discussion of mass deportation is racist or threatening to immigrants, but he said "it should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community."

He suggested that mass deportation is necessary in the wake of the "historic illegal immigration crisis."

The Brief The Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees were in Wisconsin on Monday, Oct. 8. The campaign stops are happening with just eight days until election day. Gov. Tim Walz planned to talk about early voting. JD Vance's focus was on the economy.



The Republican and Democratic vice presidential nominees will be in Wisconsin on Monday, Oct. 28 – with just eight days until the election.

Tim Walz visit

Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made a morning visit in Manitowoc on Monday. Around 1:30 p.m., Walz made a campaign stop in Waukesha. The Harris-Walz campaign indicated the governor's visits was to encourage early voting.

"So someone told me, you know, we have, we have like less than 200 hours left. You can just write it out and sign this. So but we're going to take the message to all parts of the country," Walz said. "And again, it is a privilege to be in this position. Billions of people around the world cannot imagine what it's like. This democracy demands we protect it. It's quite a privilege. You are quite literally living one of a handful of shades that will make the difference of what this country looks like, not just for four years, but the next 40 years."

Monday's visit was Walz's seventh to Wisconsin since becoming Kamala Harris' running mate.

"This is someone unfit for the office," Walz said of former President Donald Trump. "This is someone who uses terms that dictators use and praises and proud of Xi Jinping ruling China with an iron fist. And he's just so envious of that. That's the antithesis of everything that we believe."

Reaction to Walz visit

WisGOP Chairman Brian Schimming

"Try as he may, Tim Walz cannot explain away or distract voters from the last four years of high inflation, open borders, and conflict overseas. He and Kamala Harris have nothing to offer but a repeat of the failed Biden administration."

JD Vance visit

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was in Wausau on Monday afternoon before visiting Racine in the evening.

The Trump-Vance campaign indicated Vance would be focusing his remarks on the economy.

"The number one most important dishonesty is that she has nothing to do with what’s been going on in the United States of America for the last 3.5 years," Vance said. "Kamala Harris would make us believe she hasn’t been near Joe Biden, she had nothing to do with Joe Biden."

The Vance rally came a day after a Trump rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe said this:

"I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it's called Puerto Rico."

Vance, as he usually does, took reporter questions.

"I didn’t hear it when it happened. A comedian told a joke and I don’t think that’s newsworthy," he said. "What is news is that Americans cannot afford their groceries. I’m not worried that a joke that a comedian who has no affiliation with Donald Trump’s campaign told that a lot of people are going to wake up and say: 'we’re not going to Donald Trump, now.' We’re going to look past the fact that we can’t afford groceries because somebody made a joke that we don’t like."

Former President Clinton visit

Meanwhile, the Harris-Walz campaign announced that former President Bill Clinton will travel to the Fox Valley and Milwaukee on Thursday, Oct. 31 to mobilize Wisconsinites to vote early.

Bad Bunny is throwing his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of the Democratic presidential nominee to his more than 45 million followers on Instagram.

Bad Bunny, whose official name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is one of the most famous artists of the moment. His backing could be a boost for the Harris campaign as it tries to bolster its support with Latino voters, among whom Trump has been working to gain ground.

The 30-year-old Puerto Rican reggaeton artist, who has popular songs such as "Dakiti" and "Titi Me Preguntó," has won three Grammy Awards. He was the most streamed artist on Spotify in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and was only surpassed by Taylor Swift in 2023. He was named Artist of the Year by Apple Music in 2022.

The video shared by Bad Bunny on Instagram shows Harris saying "there’s so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters and for Puerto Rico." A representative of the artist confirmed that Bad Bunny is supporting Harris.

The artist then shared several times another part of the clip where Harris says, "I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader," she says.

His endorsement came shortly after a comedian who spoke at the opening of Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday called Puerto Rico a "floating island of garbage." The remarks by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe were immediately criticized by Harris’ campaign and were also criticized by Puerto Rican star Ricky Martin, who was among the first to support Harris as she launched her presidential bid in July.

"That's what they think of us," Ricky Martin shared on Instagram, and encouraged followers to vote for Harris.

The Puerto Rican vote is sizable in Pennsylvania, which is arguably the hardest fought of the swing states in the 2024 election. Other Puerto Rican singers such as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony had already expressed support for Harris. Trump has also attracted support from other popular stars from the island such as Anuel AA and Nicky Jam.

Bad Bunny has been vocal about criticizing Puerto Rico’s electric system, which was razed by Hurricane Maria. In a 2022 music video for his song "El Apagon," the artist called out the company Luma Energy, which handles transmission and distribution, for the constant power outages that plague the island.

One of his most recent songs, "Una Velita," is also a protest against the government response following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.

A year after the storm, public health experts estimated that nearly 3,000 perished because of the effects of Hurricane Maria. But Trump, whose efforts to help the island territory recover have been persistently criticized, repeatedly questioned that number saying it rose "like magic."

His visit to the island after the hurricane elicited controversy such as when he tossed paper towels. His administration released $13 billion in assistance years later, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election. And a federal government watchdog found that officials hampered an investigation into delays in aid delivery.

Bad Bunny also shared a part of the clip showing Harris saying that Trump "abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults."

Harris visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia earlier on Sunday and released her policy related to the island saying she wants to create a task force to attract investment to fix the electrical grid. And Trump is headed on Tuesday to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where more than half of its population is Hispanic and a majority of them from Puerto Rico.

In 2020, Bad Bunny allowed the Biden campaign to use one of his hits "Pero Ya No" in a TV ad.
Democratic heavyweights Kamala Harris, Tim Walz and Chuck Schumer are all indicating that they will try to weaken or kill the Senate filibuster if their party wins big on Election Day.

Harris and Walz, who are at the top of the Democratic ticket for the 2024 election cycle, have each indicated they believe the filibuster needs to go, while Schumer suggested in August that he would move to eliminate it if Democrats can secure a Senate majority. The filibuster is a key Senate rule that requires 60 votes to pass most major legislation rather than a simple majority of 51, frustrating slim majorities looking to pass transformative laws by narrow margins. (RELATED: Elizabeth Warren Calls Filibuster Racist Months After Filibustering Tim Scott Police Reform Bill)

Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-NY): “You will not stop us from passing [gun control]. If the filibuster obstructs us, we will abolish it. If the Supreme Court objects, we will expand it.” What happened to “defending democracy”? pic.twitter.com/wivfbkqPAo — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 2, 2022

Most recently, Walz suggested that he and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page when it comes to getting rid of the filibuster while the pair played video games on a Sunday live stream.

“I don’t know where you stand, but I’m going to guess you and I are probably the same on the filibuster,” Walz said during the stream.

“Oh yeah, we have got to get rid of that thing,” Ocasio-Cortez said in response.

Walz also endorsed abolishing the Electoral College during an October fundraiser with Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, though the Harris campaign subsequently attempted to clean up his comments by saying they are not representative of the campaign’s positions.

In September, Harris said she supports eliminating the filibuster in order to codify Roe v. Wade’s protections for abortion access.

“I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,” Harris said. “And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.”

Schumer, who helms the Democratic caucus in the Senate, has also suggested that he would take aim at the filibuster if his party is able to land a majority on Election Day. Senate Democrats tried to kill the filibuster in the first half of President Joe Biden’s term in office to pass the massive “Build Back Better” plan, but then-Democratic Sens. Krysten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia held out against that effort despite immense pressure from activists.

Eventually, Democrats managed to pass the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — Biden’s signature climate bill and a pared-down version of the “Build Back Better” plan — without a single GOP vote by using the budget reconciliation process.

“We got it up to 48, but, of course, Sinema and Manchin voted no; that’s why we couldn’t change the rules. Well, they’re both gone,” Schumer told reporters during the Democratic National Convention in August, NBC News reported. “Ruben Gallego is for it, and we have 51. So even losing Manchin, we still have 50.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned that eliminating the filibuster would allow Democrats to add two new states to the country that would reliably elect Democratic senators who would then enable the party to pursue major agenda items that are currently out of reach.

If Democrats can sufficiently weaken or eliminate the filibuster, “they’ll admit the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as two new states — that’s four Democratic senators in perpetuity — and then they’ll go after the Supreme Court,” McConnell told The Owensboro Times in August.

Notably, the late former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ended the filibuster for judicial nominations in 2013 to help get former President Barack Obama’s blocked nominees though the Senate, but that decision also helped pave the way for former President Donald Trump to appoint three justices to the Supreme Court during his term in office, according to CNN.

The Harris-Walz campaign and Schumer’s office did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The Washington Post editorial board hasn't endorsed a single Republican for president over the past 50 years. It isn't endorsing one this cycle, either, but it's the fact that it isn't endorsing Kamala Harris either that has caused yet another uproar at an elite media institution.

"The winner of the election is going to be sitting down the street from The Washington Post," longtime Post media writer Paul Farhi told Fox News Digital. "I mean, you don't think you have an opinion about that? Sure you do. And so it just makes it all the more curious and odd that they should back off this way."

A look at the paper's recent history and coverage of Trump leaves no doubt as to where it stands on the GOP standard-bearer, which it's called the worst president in modern history who should have been removed from office after the January 6 Capitol riot.

The Post announced on Friday that it would not be offering an endorsement in the upcoming presidential election or any future one, in what publisher Will Lewis said was a "returning to our roots." The Post had endorsed a Democrat for president in every election since 1976, except for when it skipped one in 1988. The Los Angeles Times also made waves this month after deciding not to endorse for president in spite of its clear antipathy toward Trump.

WASHINGTON POST SKIPS WHITE HOUSE ENDORSEMENT, BUT LIBERAL TILT STILL EVIDENT IN SENATE AND HOUSE NODS

Had the Post's announcement been made a year ago, it might not have caused such a stir. But 11 days before a consequential election, after years of calling Trump an unfit disgrace, its decision set off cold fury at the paper and unprecedented outrage from former Post luminaries.

At least two members of the Post's staff have resigned. Nineteen Post columnists have signed onto a letter condemning the decision, specifically calling on Trump to be identified as a threat to the rule of law and the country. Subscribers have reportedly canceled by the hundreds and into the thousands.

And the paper's union fretted that management was interfering with independent journalism, due to reports that the Post's owner, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, forced the move in light of Trump's possible return to power.

Yet the paper's editorials could leave no doubt as to where it stands on the 45th president and who should be the 47th.

On Oct. 12, it castigated Trump's "insidious" rhetoric in recent interviews and rallies. On Sept. 11, it said he lost his debate to Kamala Harris on "tone and substance." It's said in recent months he would govern "chaotically," that Harris is clearly "better" when comparing the two candidates, and that he had a "reservoir of grievance" at his Republican nomination acceptance speech.

He has an "extreme agenda" and is "unpredictable" and "outright dangerous," the Post argued earlier this year when it feared then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden could lose the race; he would later step aside and be replaced by Harris.

JONATHAN TURLEY: WHY I'M CONGRATULATING THE WASHINGTON POST

In 2016 and 2020, the Post enthusiastically endorsed Hillary Clinton and Biden against Trump. It called him "dreadful" and "uniquely unqualified" in 2016. In 2020, it referred to Trump as "the worst president of modern times."

Farhi, who left the the Post after 35 years in 2023, is among those who was puzzled by the logic in deciding not to offer an endorsement that would reflect the newspaper's values, even if it wouldn't move the needle with voters.

"Let's say the Post, like the New York Times, endorsed Harris, which it appears they were intending to do until the intervention by Bezos," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Would anyone care? No one would care because what do you expect? The Post isn't going to endorse Trump, so, oh they endorsed Harris? Well, The New York Times endorsed Harris at the end of September. It was not a big deal … I just don't get the larger thinking about this."

In addition, Farhi noted, the Post's reporters have sharply probed and investigated Trump's rhetoric, policies, scandals, business dealings and more over the years. Its motto, "Democracy Dies in Darkness," was adopted in 2017, shortly after Trump took office, although the paper denied it was a direct response to him.

WASHINGTON POST UNION, STAFFERS REVOLT OVER DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BLAME BEZOS

"The Post has a very long track record of having written story after story investigating Trump, and in fact, lots of editorials about Trump's behavior and Trump's record in office, so why would an endorsement be the thing that triggers Trump?" Farhi asked.

The Post has not completely supported Harris either, criticizing her earlier this year for her "gimmicks" on the economy such as a plan to ban "price gouging," and offering up questions it would love to ask her, such as why she's changed so many positions since her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign.

But an endorsement of Harris was reportedly drafted and ready to publish before Bezos pulled the plug. Instead of a fully expected statement of support by a liberal editorial board that plainly views Trump as a threat to the republic, an 11th-hour declaration of neutrality served only to sow confusion and anger.

"Today has been an absolute stab in the back," left-wing Post columnist Karen Attiah wrote on Friday. "What an insult to those of us who have literally put our careers and lives on the line, to call out threats to human rights and democracy."
Vice President Kamala Harris received the most slanted television coverage in history, a study by NewsBusters found Monday.

The biased coverage provides a reason why Americans’ trust in the establishment media to report current events “fully, accurately and fairly” plummeted to a record low in 2024, Gallup polling found in October.

WATCH — Massive Line of Supporters Wait Outside of Madison Square Garden Hours Before Trump’s Speech:

Tracey Alvino

Seventy-eight percent of television coverage of Harris was positive since July, while television coverage of former President Donald Trump was 85 percent negative, NewsBusters reported:

One week before Election Day, a new analysis from the Media Research Center finds that broadcast evening news coverage of the 2024 presidential race has been the most lopsided in history. Since July, ABC, CBS and NBC have treated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to 78 percent positive coverage, while these same networks have pummeled former Republican President Donald Trump with 85 percent negative coverage. (See Methodology explanation at the end of this post.) The difference in coverage between the two candidates is far greater than in 2016, when both Trump and then-challenger Hillary Clinton received mostly negative coverage (91% negative for Trump, vs. 79% negative for Clinton). It’s even greater than in 2020, when Joe Biden was treated to 66 percent positive coverage, vs. 92 percent negative for Trump. The main reason for the imbalance: Since July, the Big Three have swamped their audiences with more than 230 minutes of airtime — virtually all of it negative — about an array of personal controversies surrounding the former President, yet provided extremely light coverage or altogether ignored many controversies involving Vice President Harris. Instead, Harris’s coverage has been larded with enthusiastic quotes from pro-Harris voters, creating a positive “vibe” for the Democrat even as network reporters criticize Trump themselves.

More is here on the NewsBusters study.

It appears Americans see through biased coverage.

Biden waited in line with other voters outside the state of Delaware Department of Elections and helped push an older woman in a wheelchair ahead of him before casting his ballot. After voting, Biden greeted reporters outside, where he was asked whether it was a bittersweet moment.

Biden responded, "No, this is just sweet."

Biden stepped down from his re-election campaign in July following a poor debate performance that stoked concerns about his health and Democrats' worries about his chances of defeating Trump.

LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP RIDES HIGH AFTER MSG RALLY AS HE AND HARRIS NEAR ONE WEEK TO ELECTION DAY

Biden was asked what he thought about the massive rally Trump held at Madison Square Garden the previous night.

"It’s beneath any president but that’s what we’re used to," Biden said. "That’s why this election is so important."

Biden added that Trump puts his own character into question "every time he opens his mouth."

Trump took the stage Sunday night in front of a packed house of thousands of supporters, focusing his speech on spiraling immigration, inflation woes and looking toward the future with lower consumer costs and securing the border.

When asked about the Israel-Hamas war and a potential cease-fire, Biden responded, "We need a cease-fire, we should end this war."

Regarding another conflict abroad, the Russia-Ukraine war, Biden was asked about North Korea deploying troops to help Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"It’s very dangerous," Biden said, of the apparent escalation.

The range of questions included whether he thought Elon Musk’s $1 million offer to swing-state voters who sign his political action committee’s petition backing the Constitution was election interference. Biden called the tech billionaire’s offer "totally inappropriate."

Biden was also asked if he thought Democrats – including Harris – would win.

"I think we will," he said.

Former President Trump was joined by a bevy of high-profile politicians and celebrities at his historic Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday evening, including surprise attendees and speakers.

"The anti-war/anti-inflation candidate," "Jersey Shore" star Vinny Guadagnino posted to Instagram stories, alongside a video of Trump taking the stage at MSG. "I don't vote for anyone I don't vote for anyone Dick Cheney votes for!"

Guadagnino was spotted in the front row of the sold-out rally on Sunday, sharing videos of top speakers and showering them with praise online, such as posting on Instagram that former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was "spittin facts" when she said a vote for Harris was a "vote for war." A reporter with Semafor snagged a photo of Guadagnino in the front row, sharing it on X.

Trump took the stage for the massive rally just after 7 p.m. on Sunday, where roughly 20,000 supporters managed to get a spot in the packed arena, with an estimated 20,000 more supporters gathered outside the Midtown Manhattan venue.

High-profile supporters touted Trump in prepared remarks ahead of the 45th president’s address, including a few surprise appearances.

Former first lady Melania Trump, for example, introduced her husband at the rally in a surprise appearance where she lamented crime trends and a declining quality of life over the last few years, before looking toward the future under a potential second Trump administration.

"Envision a wonderful America where the seeds of security, prosperity and health are sown once again for the benefit of our families. Let us start together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let's seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve," she said.

For hours ahead of Trump’s remarks, high-profile supporters addressed the crowds, including tech billionaire Elon Musk, Dr. Phil McGraw, former Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, UFC CEO Dana White, Hulk Hogan, Sen. JD Vance and others.

Elon Musk’s mom, model Maye Musk, was also spotted in the crowd, alongside Musk’s young son.

"I’m not here just to stand up for Donald J. Trump. Lord knows, he doesn’t need me to stand up for him. He’s tough as an old army boot. He’s got lots of enemies, different groups that are scared, and between them, they have impeached him, indicted him, raided him, railroaded him, shot him and sued him. And where is he? He is still standing," McGraw said at the rally.

"When you attack a citizen, and you use the power of the Internet, you use mob mentality, you incite people to gang up and cause boycotts, then it is beyond ugly," he said. "And that is what is happening in this country right now, and that is not OK."

Kennedy, who is the son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, dropped out of the presidential election in August after initially running as a Democrat, before he switched to an independent run. Kennedy endorsed Trump shortly after suspending his campaign, and has since hit the campaign trail while touting his plans to "Make America Healthy Again" under a potential Trump presidency.

TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY AT NEW YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY

Kennedy unleashed on his former Democratic Party during his remarks Sunday, saying it has devolved into the party "of war."

"The Democratic Party is the party of war. It's the party of the CIA. You had Kamala Harris giving a speech at the Democratic convention that was written by neocons. It was belligerent, pugnacious. It talked about domination of the world by the United States through our weapons of war. It's the party today that wants to divide Americans. It's a party that is dismantling women's sports by letting men play women's sports," he said.

"It's the party of Wall Street. It's the party of Bill Gates, who just gave $50 million to Harris. It's the party, and the Harris campaign is very proud that it received the endorsement of 50 former CIA agents and officers and of John Bolton and of Dick Cheney."

Musk sported his hallmark all-black "dark MAGA" hat, which he called his "dark gothic MAGA" look on Sunday.

"Your money is being wasted. And the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook," Musk said, referring to his plans to serve as Trump’s "Secretary of Cost-Cutting" for the federal government if the 45th president is victorious next week.

High-profile politicians were also in attendance on Sunday, including New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, and others. Stefanik, Johnson and Donalds also addressed the crowd in prepared speeches.

Hulk Hogan, the retired professional wrestler and longtime friend of Trump’s, also took the stage during the rally, which operated similarly to the RNC, where speakers filed onto the stage in quick succession to deliver short remarks ahead of Trump’s speech.

Hogan, who also spoke during the RNC in July, slammed Harris in his speech, saying she is responsible for the millions of illegal immigrants who crossed the border since 2021 while acting as if "she’s the victim."

TRUMP CAMP RESPONDS TO BACKLASH OVER COMEDIAN'S PUERTO RICO JOKE AT RALLY

"All of a sudden, she flips, she flops, she spins and turns around and acts like she was going to be the damn hero," said Hogan. "But we all know Trump is the only man that can fix this country today, and with Trump as our commander in chief, peace through strength will fix all of our problems in the Middle East."

One of the speakers, comedian of "Kill Tony" podcast fame Tony Hinchcliffe, came under fire from critics for cracking a joke about Puerto Rico, which the campaign distanced itself from shortly after. The comedian brushed off the blowback over his joke that Puerto Rico is a "floating island of garbage," saying on X that Democrats "have no sense of humor," adding, "I love Puerto Rico."

Trump’s speech focused on efforts and initiatives he will undertake if elected president to "Make America Great Again," including deporting illegal immigrants, banning sanctuary cities across the nation, slashing energy costs by 50% within a year of taking office, reeling in spiraling inflation, and ending taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. He also took shots at the Biden-Harris administration, including saying Harris was behind "the most egregious betrayal" of any U.S. leader due to the current White House’s immigration policies.

"Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens," he said.

TRUMP RIDES HIGH AFTER MSG RALLY AS HE AND HARRIS NEAR ONE WEEK TO ELECTION DAY

Trump added that under his leadership, the Republican Party has become the "party of inclusion."

"Jews and Muslims and Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons, and they're all joining our cause in large numbers, larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before, larger than they've ever seen in any country," he said.

"And we're a big, powerful party, and they're losing it. They're really losing it. Together we will lift America to glory beyond your wildest dreams. It's going to happen fast, too."

Trump’s rally in deep blue New York was underscored by his remarks that he’s making a long-shot play for the state.

"You gotta vote. It would be such an honor to win New York. Hasn't been done in decades. Hasn’t been done in so long. It hasn't been done in so long. They all say, ‘Sir, you're wasting your money.’ I don't think so. Your crime is through the roof. Everything is through the roof," he said. The last time a Republican presidential candidate won the Empire State was in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan’s landslide re-election victory, when he only lost the state of Minnesota.

The Biden-Harris Department of Justice prosecuted former Trump adviser and "War Room" host Stephen K. Bannon for actions that Democrats — including Attorney General Merrick Garland and former Attorney General Eric Holder — have similarly executed but without consequence.

Bannon, ultimately convicted in 2022 for supposed contempt of Congress, is scheduled to be released Tuesday from the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, where he has been sidelined for the past four months.

Bannon's allies have been counting the days until he could resume the work of championing the MAGA movement. Some of his critics have similarly been counting the days, albeit with concern over the possibility that he might prove effective once again in mobilizing Republican voters in the final days before the election — after all, Bannon's podcast ranks in the top 30 on Apple's U.S. political list.

"My Dad is a political prisoner of Nancy Pelosi, Merrick Garland, and the corrupt Biden-Harris regime," Bannon's adult daughter, Army veteran, and WarRoom CEO Maureen Bannon, noted on X. "They wanted to silence him and shut down the WarRoom by putting him in Danbury FCI, but all they did was make WarRoom and the Posse bigger, stronger, and more unstoppable!"

"His return will be EPIC!" continued Maureen Bannon. "UNLEASH THE HONEY BADGER!"

Speaking with the titular host of "The Todd Starnes Show" over the weekend, Maureen Bannon indicated that her father's message to "America first conservatives" ahead of his release was to "get out and vote."

"It's very frightening that the Democrats are the ones who say that President Trump, when he is re-elected, will be the one to throw his opponents or anyone that doesn’t agree with him in prison," said Bannon's daughter. "That’s exactly what the left is doing. They did it for Peter Navarro. They put him in prison for four months. They put my dad in prison for four months. This should wake everyone up."

'Don't pray for me. Pray for our enemies.'

"Bannon becomes the new Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn — but for America — tomorrow, October 29, 2024. Soviet Communism's poster child of political persecution," said Jeff Clark, a former assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's environment and natural resources division.

"He will have withstood being a political prisoner only to emerge, fully energized, and at the top of his game on the eve of the most important election of our lifetimes, where we roll back the tide of Communism for at least another four years or we risk the destruction of the Republic and its conversion, through the border invasion, censorship, and oppression, into a one-party monopoly," added Clark.

Myra Adams, a writer who worked on the late John McCain's campaign in 2008, expressed trepidation, noted in an op-ed for The Hill, "Bannon’s release, with its movie-like timing, will be a Hollywood ending to modern America’s wildest and contentious [sic] presidential campaign. In the last week, Bannon could motivate Trump’s base as a 'poster child' for his well-versed judicial weaponization and retribution themes."

Adams noted further:

Bannon will likely juice Trump’s get-out-the-vote effort to 'save America' from ruin. In the distorted MAGA mindset, that means only Trump can stop bloated, wasteful government, domestic fascism, economic collapse, the migrant invasion, wokeism and anti-Christianity. Only Trump can reduce inflation and the national debt, increase energy production and end foreign entanglements

Bannon was convicted in July 2022 of two charges of contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the Democrat-controlled House Select committee investigating the Jan. 6 protests.

Around the time of Bannon's sentencing, Blaze Media co-founder Glenn Beck said, "Do you recognize your country anymore? We used to be a nation of fundamental rights granted to us by God, and we lived under a system of laws that promised justice. Not social justice, but justice justice. Can I ask you what American justice even means anymore?"

"Was it justice when Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison for contempt of Congress? We've seen people defy Congress for decades, but no one ever goes to jail," continued Beck. "The last time someone went to jail for this was back in 1961. Before that ... 1948! It's rare, even though we've seen people openly defy Congress time after time."

'Every second will count.'

Christopher Bedford, senior editor for politics and Washington correspondent for Blaze Media, said at the time, "It paints a pretty clear picture of the DOJ's priorities that you're seeing Steve Bannon actually go to prison for contempt of Congress while so many others have slipped by."

Bannon reported to prison on July 1 after filing unsuccessful appeals to a full panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals and to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Before turning himself in, Bannon told a crowd of supporters outside the prison, "I am proud to go to prison. If this is what it takes to stand up to tyranny, if this is what it takes to stand up to the Garland corrupt criminal DOJ, if this is what it takes to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, if this is what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden, ... I'm proud to do it."

Ahead of receiving a blessing from a priest and invoking the help of St. Michael the Archangel, Bannon said, "Father, don't pray for me. Pray for our enemies."

Bannon's prison consultant, Sam Mangel, told CNN that during his stint, the "War Room" host first worked in the library then began teaching history and civics to his fellow inmates.

Fred Carrasco Jr., a prisoner serving more than a decade at Danbury, told NOTUS, "It's awesome the s**t this guy knows."

Peter Navarro, Trump's former White House trade adviser who also did time for a contempt of Congress conviction, noted Monday, "Every time they call us fascists, remember they put me and Bannon in prison for defending the Constitution, bankrupted Rudy, took away the bar cards of Clark and Eastman, and want @realDonaldTrump in jail for the rest of his life. Kamala Campaign desperate and desperately woke and wrong."

Raheem Kassam, Bannon ally and editor in chief of the National Pulse, told NOTUS, "I would not be surprised to see him immediately hitting the campaign trail, as well as hosting his 'War Room' show for four hours each day. Every second will count. Every word will matter."

Actor-comedian Billy Eichner is the latest Hollywood celebrity to officially start hyperventilating over the election as former President Donald Trump continues to build momentum in the final days of the campaign. In a five-alarm social media video, Eichner told fellow Democrats “it is time to fucking panic, okay?”

The three-minute video features Eichner repeatedly assailing Trump with vulgarities. At the same time, he fails to offer viewers a single reason to vote for Kamala Harris — not in terms of policy or even an emotional appeal. In fact, she barely gets a mention in his tirade.

Billy Eichner unburdened himself of his rage against all things Trump in his TikTok video posted this week.

“It is time to fucking panic, okay? And not just panic but to do something about it. Because like many people are saying today, the polls are not good,” he said. “Trump has the momentum.”

“I was out talking to voters yesterday and I did not like the vibe,” he later said.

Eichner called Trump “very, very dangerous, and not in that cool fucking way that some of his fucking fans boys think he is.”

Billy Eichner is the latest celebrity to lose his cool in recent days at the prospect of a second Trump presidency.

As Breitbart News reported, ABC’s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel recently revealed he isn’t prepared for a potential second Trump presidency and that Trump has even invaded his dreams.

Some Chinese officials are reportedly scared of a second Donald Trump presidency – and those fears are not unfounded, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Privately, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials in question appear to favor a Kamala Harris presidency for a simple reason: they feel that Trump would be more challenging to them, according to a number of officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal in October. Specifically, Chinese officials are worried that Trump will launch another trade war with China or make unpredictable moves that might rattle diplomatic norms, which caused headaches for Beijing during Trump’s first tenure. (RELATED: Former Obama AG Suing Pentagon On Behalf Of Chinese Military Company)

Most experts who spoke to the DCNF largely didn’t take a political approach as to whether Trump or Harris would be more competent in dealing with China, but rather, considered who Beijing is more likely to want to deal with — or not — over the next four years. Those experts said that it is unsurprising that China would be more wary of dealing with a Trump presidency.

“What they know about Donald Trump, which I think is a reasonable estimation, is that Trump 2.0 would be an extension of Trump 1.0 on broad economic policy. That’s a challenge for them,” Steve Yates senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former White House national security adviser, told the DCNF. “And with Harris as a presumed continuity [of Biden] … they seem to have seen recent years as relatively smoother for them, in terms of U.S.-China interaction on economics and trade.”

The concerns among officials are largely kept quiet. In public, China maintains a neutral stance toward U.S. elections and says it is open to working with either candidate.

“The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,” a spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. told the DCNF. “China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election.”

Behind closed doors, however, Beijing felt better about President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the U.S. presidential race in July, according to officials who spoke to the WSJ. Even though the Biden administration’s relationship with Beijing went through turbulent periods over the last three years, officials felt that Biden was more predictable and less tough on China.

“Under Trump, we had a bad experience,” one senior CCP official bemoaned during a closed-door meeting with U.S. think tanks earlier this year, according to the WSJ.

When Biden dropped out of the race, officials turned their favorability toward Harris, if for no other reason than that they felt she was a better option for them than Trump, according to the WSJ. (RELATED: American Brands Face Retaliation From China If They Don’t Do Business In Region Known For Slave Labor)

“From China as a whole, they don’t see much upside in either candidate … But as far as the regular sort of Chinese officials, from their perspective, they want whichever option is going to be more predictable,” Michael Cunningham, senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told the DCNF. “I think most people in the U.S. and in China think [Harris’ approach] would be much more similar to Biden’s policies.”

“There’s a broader range of possibilities if Trump is president, and some of those go in ways that the Chinese Communist Party would really not like,” Cunningham said.

Chinese hackers have now reportedly hacked into U.S. telecommunications networks to tap data on Trump’s phone, as well as his running mate, J.D. Vance, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The New York Times in a report released Friday. Iran was also implicated in the data hack.

The Trump campaign did not say what potential information, if any, was stolen, but laid blame on Harris for allowing American adversaries to interfere in the U.S. election process.

“This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,” Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, told the DCNF. “They have now stood by and allowed major foreign adversaries to attack us in order to illegally help Kamala because they know she represents a weak American who will always bow down.”

One point of particular concern about Trump for Chinese officials is that he will launch a second trade war against China in his next hypothetical term. During his first term, Trump — upset that China was exporting more goods to the U.S. than it was importing, creating a trade deficit — imposed sweeping tariffs on China.

Those tariffs raised the price of incoming goods from China. Trump’s goal was to encourage Americans to buy more products domestically and compel China to import more U.S. goods.

China vehemently opposes any sort of tariffs on its exports.

“No one will win a trade war or a tariff war. Restrictions or protectionism will only disrupt normal trade flows and the stability of the production and supply chain, which serves the interests of no one,” the embassy spokesperson told the DCNF.

Tariffs can be tricky because if used recklessly, they could burden Americans with exorbitant costs. But when implemented in the right way, they can also be an incredibly useful tool and help balance the trade scales between the U.S. and China, said Michael Sobolik, author and senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council.

“Tariffs are a blunt policy instrument, in that they cause discomfort to U.S. consumers as well as economic pain to Beijing. That said, if leveraged correctly, they could have the added benefit of incentivizing domestic industry to rework their supply chains away from dependency on [China],” Sobolik told the DCNF.

Many of the tariffs imposed under Trump carried over through the Biden administration. But that doesn’t mean Trump won’t impose even further tariffs if he wins a second term; he has already weighed the idea of imposing 60% tariffs on China if elected, which UBS economists have estimated would knock 2.5% off China’s year-by-year GDP growth. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Alleged Chinese Spy Spent Years Rubbing Elbows With Dem Congresswoman)

What Trump did with tariffs in his first term means that “there could be something else coming out of the box that no one has thought of, which is completely possible because he did it the first time,” Director of the China Policy Initiative at the America First Policy Institute Adam Savit told the DCNF. “He will have more abled personnel and be better placed to start right out of the gate with creative new policies that can bring different pressure to bear.”

Making matters particularly difficult for China is its faltering domestic economy. China’s GDP is growing at an exponential rate, but is expected to start slowing down substantially within the coming years amid trillions of dollars in debt and a failing property market.

Some Chinese citizens are scrambling to move their assets out of the country. Citizens collectively moved over $250 billion in assets out of China from the last half of 2023 to the first half of 2024; doing so is a difficult task and often involves going through loopholes such as cryptocurrency investment or overpaying for imports.

“[China] knows that they face domestic economic pressures, and if Trump is back in office, they’ll face external economic pressures in the form of tariffs or tough negotiations,” Yates told the DCNF.

China may be more eager to cooperate or negotiate with China given these factors, experts told the DCNF. Aspects of Trump’s “trade war” in his first term worked; the trade deficit initially shrank and the number of Chinese exports to the U.S. dropped, especially in 2020. That changed, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and the U.S. and other Western nations became reliant on China for certain goods.

Trump is also likely to follow through on his threats — as he has demonstrated before — whereas with Harris, she’s likely to follow Biden’s approach, Savit told the DCNF.

It’s also difficult to know what international trade policies Harris will embrace because she hasn’t clearly articulated many of her policy positions, Yates said.

“With Harris, it’s a blank slate,” Yates told the DCNF. “There’s a few things that have been fed in the course of the campaign, but not very much. [China has] had very superficial interaction with her as vice president. It’s not anything like the negotiating experience of dealing with President Trump.”

The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance clashed with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday after the host centered the interview on unproven allegations raised by a disaffected staffer of former President Donald Trump.

Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly, was the latest former aide to criticize the former president, telling The New York Times and the Atlantic last week that Trump “met the definition of a fascist” and allegedly admires figures like former Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. On “State of the Union,” Vance criticized Tapper’s fixation on the warnings, pointing out that some of the ex-staff members had been “fired” by Trump.

“But this is the thing Jake, we’ve now spent five minutes talking about people in Donald Trump’s staff, who he fired — ” Vance said.

Tapper quickly interjected that former staff members don’t believe Trump is “fit for office,” prompting Vance to question why they weren’t discussing the everyday issues that concern Americans.

“Oh they didn’t think he was unfit for office until they had a falling out with him because he fired them, and we’re not talking about public policy,” Vance said. “Can we talk about how Americans can’t afford groceries today? Can we talk about the fact that Americans can’t afford the cost of housing? Can we talk about the fact that a lot of people out there in Erie, Pennsylvania, they’re the ones who suffer and die when people like Mark Esper and Mark Milley don’t obey the commander in chief’s orders?”

The CNN host continued to highlight how some of the concerns from former staff members stem from Trump’s previous “enemy within” comments. Tapper asserted that the statement indicated Trump’s desire to “use the military to go after” the American people. (RELATED: ‘I’ve Heard It All Before’: Scott Jennings Lists Republicans Who Democrats Compared To Hitler In The Past)

“He did not say that Jake! He said that he was going to send the military after the American people? Show me the quote where he said that!” Vance responded. “He said far-left lunatics, he’s talking about people rioting after the election — ”

WATCH:

Tapper questioned whether Democratic California Reps. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi had been rioting after the election, asserting that Trump had included them among those the military should target. However, Vance pushed back against Tapper’s claims, stating that the host was conflating “two separate phrases.”

“Here’s the game that you’re playing,” Vance continued. “He said that he wanted to use the military to go after far left lunatics who are rioting and he also called them the enemy within. He separately, in a totally different context and a totally different conversation, said that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were threats to this country.”

The two continued to debate the former president’s meaning, each challenging the other’s perspective.

“Fox asked him about this last week and he didn’t take issue with it. He said the enemy within is the biggest threat to this county — ” Tapper said.

“But did he say the enemy within — that he’s going to use the military against Nancy Pelosi? Donald Trump offered Nancy Pelosi the National Guard on January 6 and according to private emails, she rejected it,” Vance concluded.

Following Kelly’s comments to the NYT, Vice President Kamala Harris called Trump a fascist during her CNN town hall event with host Anderson Cooper on Wednesday evening. Harris’s statement echoes previous remarks from Trump’s former staff members, who have compared the ex-president to Hitler, suggesting he would rule like a fascist if he wins in November.

However, the rhetoric against Trump has persisted since his first term in 2016, including calls for his imprisonment beginning as early as 2019. During a gathering with President Joe Biden at New Hampshire’s Democratic National Committee office on Tuesday, Biden stated that the party needs to “lock up” Trump, quickly clarifying that he meant to “politically” lock him up.

Former President Trump vowed Saturday to slash U.S. energy costs in half if re-elected, seizing on oil and gas policies to draw a sharp contrast with Kamala Harris in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.

Speaking to voters at a rally in State College, Trump vowed to lift the U.S. pause on U.S. liquefied natural gas export terminals, embrace fracking and otherwise undo what he described as the "disastrous" energy policies enacted under the Biden administration.

"Starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris' war on Pennsylvania energy," Trump told the crowd. "And we will frack, frack, frack."

BIDEN CLAPS BACK AT TRUMP IN FIERY PITTSBURGH SPEECH: 'HE'S A LOSER'

Fracking, the process of using pressurized fluids to extract natural gas from shale rock, is a controversial technology and one Harris previously pledged to ban when seeking the presidency in 2019.

But fracking is necessary to access the vast gas resources tucked away in Pennsylvania. The state is not only a pivotal battleground state with 19 electoral votes. It's also the second-largest natural gas producer in the U.S.

Although Harris has repeatedly reiterated her support for fracking on the campaign trail this election cycle, some Republicans and gas groups have sought further assurances from the campaign as Election Day draws closer, citing the four years of mixed messaging they saw under Biden.

In the absence of that clarity, Trump has attempted to fill in the blanks on Harris' policies himself.

​​VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD PROBE INVOLVING 2,500 APPLICATIONS CONFIRMED BY PA. ELECTION OFFICIALS

Harris, he said Saturday, has been against fracking "her whole life." She’s been against "anything having to do with anything underground," Trump told the audience.

"She’ll build a windmill," he said, "to kill all your birds."

Trump blamed Harris for what he views as the Biden administration’s failures on U.S. oil and gas production, including its outsize focus on electric vehicle manufacturing and production, the shuttering of aging power plants and the spike in energy prices, which increased by as much as 50% in the Keystone State.

He described the U.S. natural gas export pause, ordered by President Biden in January, as "Kamala’s ban."

During a second term, Trump pledged, all that would change.

"Your energy prices will be cut in half within 12 months from Jan. 20, which is when we would take over," he told the packed stands of supporters, who responded with roars of applause.

Some had been lined up outside the central Pennsylvania arena for hours to hear Trump speak, long before the doors opened at noon, almost six hours before he eventually danced his way onstage.

Several attendees said they’d been waiting since dawn to see Trump, and the promises made by the former commander in chief did not seem to disappoint them, if their cheers were any indication.

"We’re going to fix it very fast," Trump told the audience. "Kamala broke it, and I will fix it."

Democrats, he said, "waged a war on your commonwealth like never before."

"They annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and other foreign nations all over the world.

"You're going to come back under the Trump administration."

Trump vowed to remedy what he described as the "disgusting failures" of the Biden administration in the energy sector and beyond.

"This will be America’s golden age," he said, "and every problem facing us will be solved."

SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Shannon Bream.



With just two weeks until Election Day, President Trump and Vice President Harris look to energize critical voters that could make or break them.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: November 5th, 2024 will be liberation day in America.



KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will win because we know what we stand for.



BREAM (voice-over): With a race in a dead heat, Trump and Harris make their final pitches to America as polls show both candidates struggling with key voting blocs.



Maryland Governor Wes Moore joins us exclusively on the vice president's full court press to shore up support from Black men, and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin on the commonwealth's battle with the DOJ over efforts to purge non-citizens from its voter rolls.



Then, our legal panel discusses the election battles taking shape and the litigation that could take center stage after the ballots are counted.



Plus --



BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Well, this is not the end of the war in Gaza. It's the beginning of the end.



BREAM: Fallout from the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks.



Our Sunday panel on whether his death puts new pressure on Israel and Hamas to restart ceasefire and hostage release negotiations, straight ahead on "FOX News Sunday".



(END VIDEOTAPE)



BREAM (on camera): Hello from FOX News in Washington.



We begin with some of your top headlines.



At least seven people are dead and six critically injured after a crowded ferry dock collapsed on an island off the coast of Georgia Saturday. Many were elderly descendants of slaves who were at an event honoring their ancestors.



Israeli forces say they struck Hamas targets in northern Gaza and Hezbollah facilities around Beirut this weekend. Iranian backed Hezbollah militants fired rockets into northern Israel and launched a drone that came down near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home. He was not there at the time.



President Trump is set to crisscross Pennsylvania with a number of events today while Vice President Harris is focusing on battleground Georgia. In a moment, we will talk with Governors Wes Moore of Maryland and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.



But, first, we've got team coverage on the campaign trail. Alex Hoff with the Vice President in Atlanta and Mark Meredith covering President Trump in Pennsylvania.



Mark, we start with you. Good morning.



MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning to you.



Former President Trump is going to be all over Pennsylvania today, determined to gain any momentum he can in this battleground state and the candidate himself is also pushing back against reports promoted by Democrats, including his opponent, that he's exhausted in this final stretch of the campaign.



Overnight, Trump rallying thousands of his supporters in Latrobe, that's outside of Pittsburgh. He told the crowd that he believes voters in Pennsylvania have an ally in him and that he believes they should also send a message to Washington.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: So you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough, that you just can't take it anymore. Vice President Kamala, you're fired! Get the hell out of here. You're fired!



(END VIDEO CLIP)



MEREDITH: Our latest FOX survey finding Trump leading Vice President Harris overall when it comes to voter preference. But in the battleground states which will determine this outcome, Harris has the advantage by about six points.



I mentioned we're going to see Trump at the town hall here where I am, but he's also going to be stopping at a McDonald's somewhere in this state today, clearly an effort to counter an attack by Vice President Harris. She completely -- she repeatedly talks about her time working at McDonald's as a young woman and Trump says he wants to show how it's done -- Shannon.



BREAM: We look forward to the video, Mark. Thank you very much for that report.



Joining us now, Alexandria Hoff, live in Atlanta, with the other side of the ticket.



Hey, Alex.



ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Shannon. Yeah, the vice president is welcoming both entertainment and political star power to give her campaign a final boost of enthusiasm. Yesterday afternoon, pop star Lizzo helped at a get out the vote rally that happened in Detroit, and then here in Atlanta, Usher voiced his support for the vice president. At her evening rally here in Atlanta, Harris said this about her competitor's rally style.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



HARRIS: Have you noticed, he tends to go off script and ramble? And generally for the life of him cannot finish a thought, and he has called it the weave. But I think we here will call it nonsense.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



HOFF: Well, Harris did praise Georgia's historic early in-person vote totals in just five days, more than 1.3 million ballots have been accepted. Coming up on Thursday, former President Obama will travel to Georgia to campaign with the vice president for the first time side by side. Former First Lady Michelle Obama will do the same in Michigan next Saturday.



And Harris will also be joined by former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. That's going to be a series of moderated conversations. Those will take place across Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan -- Shannon.



BREAM: Critical states.



Alex Hoff reporting from Georgia -- Alex, thank you very much.



Joining us now, Maryland Governor Wes Moore.



Governor, welcome back to the show.



GOV. WES MOORE (D), MARYLAND: It's great to be back with you.



BREAM: Good to have you.



Okay. So let's start here. A lot of headlines the last few weeks about Black voters specifically and the campaign's efforts to try to reach them.



Here's some FOX News polling and it shows us that while the vice president clearly maintains a large lead with this group over President Trump, we now show her lowest level of support with Black voters since she became the nominee at just 67 percent. Both President Biden, Secretary Clinton, they were in the 90s.



Now you have said Black voters, not monolithic. You got to get out there and earn their vote.



Why are these numbers trending away from vice president?



MOORE: Well, I think, you know, we have to understand that Black voters are sophisticated, and Black voters need to hear, you know, what is the vision? What is the ideas? And what is the -- what are the values that we know that we can base our votes off of?



And there's a natural skepticism that I think a lot of Black voters have and not necessarily about the vice president, not about -- about a Democratic Party? It's about pace of progress in America, is that the pace of progress in America has not been even, and it has not been fair.



And that's why I think this past week for the opportunity agenda for Black men that the vice president released was so important, because it is detailed policy positions as to what a Harris-Walz administration can do to be able to advance economic opportunities for Black men and focus on work and wages and wealth, and being able to have an opportunity to pass something off to your children besides debt.



Black men need to be -- you know, you have to be able to go and make your case, you have to be able to go and make your argument, and I think that's exactly what the vice president is doing now.



BREAM: So let's talk about that agenda this week really aimed at specific needs within the Black community. She's talked about forgivable business loans to help people encourage entrepreneurship, also grants that would go to public school programs specifically for young Black men.



MOORE: Yeah.



BREAM: But the vice president knows that courts across the country, including the Supreme Court, have said that they -- they tend to strike down anything that looks like it's got a race-based preference. A "Wall Street Journal" reporter pressed on that issue and reports this -- the campaign now says the programs listed under the Black men agenda will be open to all Americans on a race-neutral basis.



So some feel like this is a bit of a bait and switch saying, we're going to give specific needs to this voting bloc we need to make progress with, but actually this isn't specifically for your group.



MOORE: I think what we end up seeing with policy is that the disparities are so distinct when you're looking at everything from maternal -- maternal health to economic advancements, to the racial wealth gap.



You know, the fact that in this country, we have a 10 to 1 racial wealth gap, we're all very clear that we don't have a 10 to 1 racial wealth gap because one group worked 10 times harder, that there have been policies that have put in place to make that happen.



And so when you're looking at the opportunity agenda that's being laid out about what can we do to actually create measurements of home ownership and providing first-time -- providing capital to first-time home buyers, how that, you know, $25,000, the work can be done around addressing procurement policies and procurement laws, and ensuring that Black-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, et cetera, women-owned businesses are getting the type of resources and supports that they need to be able to grow and thrive. We know that while -- that while these are going to have a distinct impact on the African-American community, the Latino community, women, et cetera, and groups who have historically been left behind, we know that there's a way that you can address policy measures on a broad scale basis, but that will have a distinct impact on groups that historically have been disenfranchised in the past.



BREAM: So, Georgia, "Politico" went down to Georgia, of course, one of the critical swing states. The vice president there today attending church services and other events. They went down to talk to key battleground voters down there, primarily Black voters.



Here's what one 72-year-old man told him he's never voted for a Republican presidential candidate before but he's going to this time.



And this was his explanation. He says: Everything is so high now, groceries are high, clothes, everything, gas. Four years ago, it wasn't that high. And so, people see the difference in Kamala Harris and Trump, and they want some of what they had four years ago, and I do, too.



So how do you rebut this perception that people have about their own personal circumstances and the way they've experienced life under these two different administrations?



MOORE: No, I would say the frustration is real. And I'd say to that person that I understand that we have seen over the process of the past really six-year period that we've seen inflationary growth, and it's not even that things are getting less expensive, they're just not growing as fast. So I think that frustration is real. And I think we have to acknowledge that and we can't shy away from it.



The thing that I would say though when you're looking at the policies that are being laid out by the two candidates, where you have a vice president who's focusing on things like being able to lower costs of groceries, being able to lower cost of medicine, being able to focus on creating more pathways for home ownership and increasing inventory and making people giving people opportunity to own more than they owe, versus what we've heard from Donald Trump when it comes to economic policies -- things like the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which would not only add trillions of dollars to the national -- to the national deficit.



When you're looking at the over the next decade, there'll be the largest transfer of generational wealth that we have seen in our globe's history. If you look at the Trump tax cuts, that is not only going to concentrate that level of wealth and people who benefited generationally from wealth, it'll make closing things like wealth gaps absolutely impossible.



So that person I would just say, I hear you and you're right. But if you look at the policies that are being laid out, one fundamentally addresses the issues of basic affordability for everyday Americans, and one makes affordability almost a laughingstock.



BREAM: Well, President Trump's team, of course, you know will say based on IRS data coming from the IRS that people across all brackets benefited under the tax cuts that are going to expire if this new Congress, whoever is running it, decides not to actually extend them, and also unemployment for Black Americans hit a record low under President Trump before COVID.



MOORE: Yeah.



BREAM: They're going to point to that a success as well.



MOORE: Yeah.



BREAM: Now, I want to talk about the Obamas. They're wildly popular in your party and I would say beyond that, too, with a number of groups.



President Obama though is getting some backlash for his tough love that he delivered out on the campaign trail recently. It didn't go well with everyone, and that includes Stephen A. Smith who was not a Trump fan.



Here's what he had to say.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



STEPHEN A. SMITH, TV/RADIO HOST: You're President Obama, how do you ignore that? Inflation, the cost of living, the price of gas, the price of groceries, and this belief that there's an elevated level of sensitivity towards them as opposed to Black folks struggling, if not starving, in this country. Yes, that plays a role, too.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



BREAM: Makes clear he loves President Obama. He is voting for the vice president but he worries about how that message is landing.



MOORE: Yeah, yeah, and I think what the president, you know, was saying is, is that there can be two things that can exist at once, right? That we do still have a measure of sexism in our society that has to be thought about and addressed. We do have measurements of people feeling like there's economic pressures.



We're not watching wages raise fast enough, something that the vice president has actually been talking about, about how can we raise wages for individuals. And then also was saying that having an economic policy that focus on things like apprenticeship programs and trade programs and getting people back into a workforce, having an economic policy that focuses on things like helping our entrepreneurs, be able to gain the capital that they need to go from turning an idea into a growing and a thriving business. That all those things can be true and things we have to be able to address.



We have to make America more affordable for individuals. We have to make ownership more real for people within our -- within our communities. And frankly, we have to be able to address the level of skepticism and cynicism that a lot of African-Americans feel about, do they see themselves in this idea of American progress?



We can do all those things simultaneously.



BREAM: Well, and we know you're busy on the campaign trail, doing those things for the Harris-Waltz ticket. Thanks for dropping in, Governor. Always good to see you.



MOORE: It's my pleasure. Thank you.



BREAM: And joining me now, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin.



Governor, good to have you on the show today.



GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R), VIRGINIA: Yeah, Good morning, Shannon. Thank you for having me.



And thanks for giving us an opportunity to talk about this most important topic in Virginia right now which is the Department of Justice suit when we're trying to make sure that only citizens vote in Virginia and we're trying to stand by our Constitution and our law.



BREAM: Yeah. They have instituted a lawsuit against you. They've done it in Alabama as well, saying this purge goes in violation of the 90-day quiet period that federal law that says you can't do systemic or large purges within 90 days.



Here's part of their lawsuit. They say systemic removal programs are more error-prone than other forms of list maintenance and eligible voters placed on the path to removal days or weeks before election day, may be deterred from voting or unable to participate in the election on the same terms that they would have but for the commonwealth's error.



You say this is not a mass purge. It's not systemic and you -- apparently, your team has uncovered something else involving the DOJ on this specific case.



YOUNGKIN: Yeah. To be clear, this is not a purge. This is based on a law that was signed into effect in 2006 by then-Democrat Governor Tim Kaine, and it starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMVs and self-identifies as a non-citizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process, individualized, not system -- not systematic, an individualized process based on that person's self-identification as a non-citizen to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don't, they come off the voter rolls.



And, by the way, they have one last safeguard which is they can come and same-day register and cast a provisional ballot. And so, to des -- to describe this as something that's a purge is completely inaccurate. It's wholly consistent with the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and Virginia law.



And just recently, of course, what we found was that back in 2006, the then Justice Department actually approved of this law and said that it is not only further -- further constitutional, but we have given it thorough review and we're OK with you moving ahead with it.



And now, 25 days last week before the election, a Justice Department decides they are going to bring suit after this law has been in effect for 18 years, administered by Democrat and Republican governors. And this is the reason why I believe that Americans and Virginians wonder what the Justice Department is up to.



It's been in effect for 18 years. It's been applied universally by Republican and Democrat governors. And now, all of a sudden, when Virginia is getting tight, it launches a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Virginia when we are trying to make sure that citizens vote, not non- citizens.



BREAM: Well, here's a couple of questions to follow up to that. You talk about the DOJ giving approval back in 2006 or early on in conjunction with when this law was actually passed, as you note, under Democrat Senator who's now -- or excuse me, now Democrat Senator, he was a Democrat governor. But has it been used within that 90-day quiet period before? Is that why the DOJ is honing in on it this time?



YOUNGKIN: It had been used within the 90-day quiet period most recently by Democrat Governor Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam. And they said nothing about it at the time.



The reality is that this is not a purge. It is not systematic. It is individualized. And it starts with someone identifying as a non-citizen and then ending up on our voter rolls, as I said, either purposely or by accident.



And the reality is, how can we as a nation and how can I as a governor allow non-citizens to be on the voter roll? This is just not right. It's not just constitutionally correct. It's common sense.



BREAM: OK, so we know a federal judge, by the way, nominated by President Trump down in Alabama of similar suit with the DOJ. They've got a different program, but the judge there did put Alabama's program on hold, but did say if you have individualized cases, you can take those individuals off. You just can't do anything systemic.



So it'll be interesting to see what a federal judge decides with respect to Virginia. How far are you guys prepared to fight this if you lose?



YOUNGKIN: We're going to fight it because we're right. And again, this is not a systematic process. This is individualized. And it starts with someone who, in fact, declares that they are a non-citizen. And of course, there are multiple safeguards. They get 14 days to affirm they are a citizen. And if they don't, they can same-day register and cast a provisional ballot. This is constitutionally correct. It's consistent with everything that Virginia stands for. And on top of that, it's common sense.



Listen, elections in the United States should be decided by citizens and non-citizens just shouldn't be on the voter rolls. And we're going to make sure that elections in Virginia are fair and accurate and safe. We have paper ballots. We have counting machines, not voting machines. We have great custody laws, and we're going to make sure that we have the cleanest the cleanest voter rolls in the country.



BREAM: And of course, we all know it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. I want to get to the campaign itself, because that's why this is such a big issue. You have campaigned for President Trump this week in a sit down with our own Bret Baier. This is what the Vice President had to say about President Trump.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT & DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office worked with him in the situation room and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



BREAM: She cited retired General Mark Milley, who served, of course, in the Trump administration. He is quoted in Bob Woodward's new book saying this. "He is the most dangerous person ever,' meaning President Trump. 'I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental decline and so forth, but now I realize he's a total fascist. He is now the most dangerous person to this country."



There are ads with quotes from former Trump staffers, people who served under him, saying similar things. Why should Americans not have some concern if people who worked closest with President Trump are describing him this way?



YOUNGKIN: I think what this whole line of attack on President Trump reflects is the fact that we have a candidate in the Democratic Party who is unable to really convey a future vision for the country and what she's going to do to attack the most important issues. And so what do they do? They actually have to revert to old adages about what they have been calling him for a long time, which is sadly the lie that he's unfit for office.



And the reality, of course, is if they would just focus on what voters are focusing on, which is the economy, the border, national security, and of course, feeling safe in our own country because of the number of illegal immigrants that have come across the border and changed every state into a border state.



Shannon, I'm a governor in a state that is purple. It just is. And I travel around the Commonwealth consistently listening to voters. And what I hear over and over and over again is a massive concern about their economic future, their ability to afford, groceries and gas and tuition and to buy a home or make their rental payment. What I hear over and over and over again are major concerns about the millions of people who have come across the border and the hundreds of thousands of violent criminals that have come across the border just identified two weeks ago by senior ICE -- senior ICE officials. And what I also hear is major, major concerns about safety.



And these are the topics that President Trump is talking about. And the reason why the other side can't talk about them and they want to distract everyone is because they have demonstrated over the last three and a half years they don't have any answers. They've unleashed unprecedented inflation that has been a gut punch. Every time anybody walks into a grocery store, they've allowed millions upon millions of illegal immigrants to come across the border and turn every state into a border state.



And what's happened around the world is just a representation of a weak presidency, a weak vice presidency and a weak America. Americans and Virginians want strength back in the White House and they want someone who will stand for a strong economy and build one that lifts up all Americans like we had before.



High growth, low inflation, not low growth and high inflation where people can get great jobs and manufacturing comes back to the United States. This is the future that Virginians and Americans are talking to me about. And that's why we see President Trump surging in the polls around the country.



BREAM: Well, the message about what to accomplish sounds very much like the one that Governor Moore gave us as well. So we will see which one is more convincing to voters as they have been voting and they can -- continue to head to the polls ahead of November 5th.



Governor, thanks for your time.



YOUNGKIN: Shannon, thank you for having me. God bless you.



BREAM: You too.



All right, from the campaign trail to the courtroom, Trump and Harris both beefing up their legal teams in anticipation of both pre- and post-election challenges.



Our legal panel on what it means for the transfer of power. They're live next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JOSH MCKOON, GEORGIA REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN: You work for the best outcome, but prepare for the worst. So we've got our legal team in place. We're certainly prepared for a close election to deal with those post- election legal processes you go through.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



BREAM: All right, GOP Georgia Chair Josh McKoon already preparing his team for a potential post-election legal showdown, not alone. Democrats are also gearing up for litigation that could take center stage before and after the ballots are counted.



Let's talk about it with our legal eagles, Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law Professor, and Tom Dupree, former Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Welcome back, gentlemen.



TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you.



JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.



BREAM: OK, so you heard the conversation I was having with Governor Youngkin about what's going on in Virginia and the DOJ suing there. Here's what the "Wall Street Journal" editorial board says about this. "Mr. Youngkin is being sued for doing what any governor is supposed to do. Many Americans have doubts, some justified, some not, about the integrity of their elections. But Mr. Garland's 11th hour intervention will do nothing but stoke them."



What do you make of this case, Tom?



DUPREE: Yeah, you know, it's interesting. This is a super aggressive approach that the Biden administration is taking, one that I think breaks with prior departments of justice in terms of their suing states right before the election on this basis. As the Governor explained, this is something that Virginia governors have done before. It's hard to quarrel with the notion that non-citizens should not be voting in federal elections.



And instead of suing Virginia, you would hope that the Justice Department would recognize that this is an issue and that our elections need to have not just fairness and truth, but also just the perception of fairness so that people have assurance and confidence that non-citizens are not voting. And you would hope that the Justice Department, instead of suing Virginia, would work constructively with Virginia to ensure that the voter rolls don't contain non-citizens who are improperly on those rolls.



BREAM: Yeah, so Jonathan, I want to get your comment on that, but also to the other side of this. Florida is suing DHS because they said, listen, we're trying to work with the feds to clean up our voter rolls, but you guys have immigration information that we need and you're not turning it over. The Florida Secretary of State said this, "We're calling on the federal government to dismantle the barriers blocking the states from obtaining critical information needed to prevent non-citizens from voting in our elections."



So they're saying we're going to the feds to try to get this information. You won't give it to us.



TURLEY: Well, that's a complaint that various states have made and they've made this complaint that, look, at every stage, the Justice Department and the administration has harassed these states on voter identification and other laws. And this is an extension of that.



When it comes to Virginia, the key here is that they don't know who these voters are. So they're not trying to purge some group. These are people that either failed to say they were citizens or said that they were non- citizens. And the question for the state is what do you really expect us to do here?



But the other thing is that the law itself is quite reasonable. These people get a warning. This is, look, there might've been a mistake. Let's correct it. You've got 14 days. And even if that doesn't happen, they can still go in and do a provisional balloting.



And so the question is why the Department of Justice decided to go with the nuclear option here. And a lot of these states are saying this is par for the course. This is what it's been like. Every time we try to do any type of identification, voter identification laws, we get hit with these types of opposition and they won't give us information we need to protect the elections.



BREAM: Yeah. I'll be very interested to see how all of these cases turn out and whether we have -- we're likely to get a decision in Virginia pretty quickly, I would think because Alabama has been decided down there.



OK. I want to talk to you about to the federal case that we've all been following. The January 6th Special Counsel, Jack Smith case against President Trump, clearly not getting to trial anytime soon, but the release of information, which is from Jack Smith's side of things, not the defense side. We don't have that out there just yet. There's been a trickle of that information coming out.



Now, Judge Chutkan, who's overseeing it, said this in an order allowing the release of more information. She said, if the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute or appeared to be election interference.



She went on to say that any argument about what needs to happen before shouldn't happen before the elections, not relevant to her courtroom.



DUPREE: Oh, look, there's a bit of an Alice in Wonderland approach to that, needless to say. But the bottom line is that that evidence that actually was released was in a word anticlimactic. There was nothing in there was about 2000 pages, heavily redacted material, nothing in there that we didn't already know.



So I think all the talk about is she going to be interfering with the election? The answer is no, because there was nothing in there that was new. I think the significance of this release is that it signals the final pre-election chapter in the whole January 6th prosecution.



In other words, nothing more is going to happen between now and the election. There's a straight shot to the election. We'll see what happens on election night, and then the world will probably change depending on whether former President Trump is elected or not. But as far as the litigation goes, this is the final chapter before the election.



BREAM: Is it, though? It does provoke headlines and people want to know what's in there. And it certainly reignites the conversation about this January 6th.



TURLEY: Well, the whole statement of the court was curious. You know, she admitted that this was procedurally irregular. And then she went ahead and yielded to it and said, I'm still going to do it.



Now, there's no trial scheduled. There's no need to have this unsealed. This could have all been filed, left under seal. It was the judge that decided at the encouragement of Smith to release this publicly. And you compare that to like Judge Merchan in New York who said, look, we're just too close to an election. We're going to wait until after the election.



I think the judge is dead wrong here. And I think that she has fueled this view of critics that this is like opposition research that's -- that's being fed through a court docket.



BREAM: OK. We don't have much time, but I want to touch on the fact that both of the parties, both of the candidates, the campaigns, they have really geared up. There are already hundreds of lawsuits in a lot of critical states all across the country.



"The New York Times" notes this about these huge teams, these legal teams that have been built up. The legal arms race, it's the new reality of American elections since Mr. Trump's election victory in 2016. The battle over whose votes count, not just how many votes are counted, has become central to modern presidential campaigns.



Final thoughts from, a little bit from each of you. Start with you, Jonathan.



TURLEY: Well, we've seen this in every presidential election. You have the ramping up. As elections get closer, the number of lawyers increase. And some of this litigation are really placeholder lawsuits.



The key about the stuff happening now is that the first round is the only round. If you get an injunction, it's unlikely in places like Alabama, Virginia you're going to get a second bite at that. And we're seeing a lot of them maneuvering, but some of it's also place holding cases where they're saying, oh, we filed. We had concerns before.



And then we're going to see the real action unfolding on election day and afterwards. But the indications are, we're going to have an act of legal season.



BREAM: All right. Quick thought.



DUPREE: And look, my sense is we know that we're getting close to the election because the lawyers are flooding the zones and --



BREAM: Here, darn lawyers.



DUPREE: Here, I think it is the new reality, right? It's like these are elections. Unfortunately, at least in some states, are getting decided in the courtrooms, not at the ballot boxes. That's not the way the founders drew it up. It's not the way it should work. But I do think it is the new reality we have to confront.



I think both parties recognize this new reality and they're taking steps to ensure that their votes are counted. And we will see.



I hope all of this gets wrapped up before the election, but I do fear there could be more post-election litigation to come.



BREAM: I think we all know that's coming.



OK. Gentlemen, great to see you. Thanks for coming in today.



TURLEY: Thank you. Thanks, Shannon.



BREAM: Up next, the epic battle to gain balance of power on Capitol Hill. We're going to break down the possible paths for the parties in the Senate with our Sunday panel. And as key voting groups ship their alliances, which candidates tends to benefit most.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BREAM: All right. We're back with a closer look at the fight for control of the Senate.



Currently, Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate with 51 seats when you add in the independents that caucus with them. Republicans are hoping to gain control by picking up some of the seats you see here in yellow. Those will be critical. Thirty-four seats total are up for grabs.



Democrats face an uphill battle. You've got incumbents fighting to hold on to seats in six different states, Montana, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and of course, Pennsylvania.



While independents in Arizona and West Virginia are not seeking re- election, and, by the way, Maryland's race kind of competitive too.



Now, on the flip side, Republicans would need to capture only two seats to take control. Only one of President Trump wins re-election more on that in a minute.



But early on election night, the GOP is expected to pick up this prize for their column, West Virginia. They're also mounting a very strong challenge in Montana. You see how that flips the overall number.



But let's take a closer look at a couple of those seats that we mentioned there. And we'll start with West Virginia.



Former Wheeling Mayor, Glenn Elliott, and current Governor, Jim Justice, are facing off for a seat that's in play because of the retirement of Independent, Joe Manchin. Fox News Power Rankings rate this race as solidly Republican.



Now, let's look at Montana. Incumbent Jon Tester is facing a stiff challenge from Trump-backed Republican candidate, Tim Sheehy. Recent polling put Sheehy up by eight points.



But Ohio, a much tighter race, much less certain. You've got incumbent Sherrod Brown facing Trump-backed Bernie Moreno.



Currently, this is the only Senate toss up in our Fox News power ratings. If the map ends up 50/50, as you know, the newly elected vice president, whoever that is, is going to be the one casting those tie breaking votes.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



BREAM: So let's talk about it now with our Sunday group, "USA Today" White House correspondent, Francesca Chambers. Marie Harf, former State Department spokesperson. Former U.S. Army Intelligence Captain, Jeremy Hunt. And Josh Kraushaar, editor-in-chief of "Jewish Insider."



Have magically made it back to the desks after our little show and tell.



All right. Josh, which of the Senate races do you think is really -- are there any surprises that you see on the horizon?



JOSH KRAUSHAAR, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JEWISH INSIDER: Well, look, Republicans have a lot of good reasons to feel confident about their chances of retaking the majority because of what you just showed on the map, Montana and West Virginia looking like very, very strong Republican pickups.



The big question for me is that there are so many states in these purple battleground states. They're all neck-and-neck, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, with Elissa Slotkin and Mike Rogers.



These are the matchups that are going to determine whether Republicans have a really good night or whether, you know, perhaps we're in a much more evenly divided Senate where -- you could see coattails on either presidential, for whoever wins the presidential campaign.



FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, USA TODAY WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And if I could just take it a step further, Republicans are now saying they think that they're having a good night if they pick up both that Montana and the Ohio seat. Those are two red states that could hinge on the presidential election. They think that they're having a really great night if they pick up those blue wall states.



On the flip side, Democrats are saying that they think that even if Vice President Kamala Harris goes on to lose those blue wall states, that the way the polling sits right now, the fact that in Pennsylvania, as well as Wisconsin, you've got incumbents on the ballot, that they can still pull out the wins in those Senate races.



BREAM: Well, and it's interesting that we've seen a number of Democrat Senate candidates who are using President Trump in their ads and not in a negative way. I mean, we've seen Senator Casey, Senator Baldwin and Congresswoman Slotkin, who's running for that Michigan Senate seat, using Trump in a way like, oh, look, we work together. They signed my legislation. That's interesting in those blue states.



JEREMY HUNT, FORMER U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENT CAPTAIN: Exactly. I mean, if you have Democrat Senate candidates who are using, you know, president -- using imagery of President Trump in a -- in a positive way, basically, that is not looking good for Vice President Harris in a lot of ways.



But I do think, too, on the Republican side. I think one thing that we learned in 2022 is that candidate quality matters, right? And I think that with someone -- look at we mentioned Montana earlier Tim Sheehy, someone who's a Navy SEAL who, you know, got back from combat and is -- and, you know, had a very successful business.



I mean, people who are -- we need better messengers, you see better results And I think that's one of the reasons why this -- why the race is so close there and in West Virginia. I mean -- so I think those are -- those are going to be kind of critical things that Republicans have to do moving forward, is making sure we have candidates, especially, I mean, I'm a little biased as a veteran. I think veteran candidates are great, people who have served their country. And I think that makes a big difference and will make a big difference on election day.



BREAM: Yes. How much do you think that these Senate races will impact the top of the ticket? Because there's always conversation, Marie, about down ballot, but there is a lot of talk about how the up ballot could actually be a difference maker.



MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: That's true. I mean, there's a big question about how many split ticket voters still remain out there. And I actually think on the Republican side, on the Republican Party side, there's probably a lot.



We know that a lot of Republicans don't want to vote for Donald Trump, but maybe they want to vote for Dave McCormick. Maybe they want to vote for Mike Rogers.



I agree that candidate quality matters. What is so interesting to me about the Montana race is that Tim Sheehy now, in multiple accounts, has lied about whether he was shot in combat. He said he was. Now it turns out he shot himself accidentally while visiting a national park in the United States. So he's under a ton of fire in Montana.



I wonder if in the last 16 days, those numbers will shift a little more towards Tester because of his line in this case.



But when you look at a Sherrod Brown in Ohio, my home state, for example, I think he is going to win. I think he is -- he is beloved in that state. He has -- he has bucked the tide of Democrats losing in that state.



And you will see people in Ohio vote for Donald Trump and vote for Sherrod Brown. I don't think there are a ton of those voters, but in some of these close states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, in particular, I do think there are a lot of Republicans and Independents who do not want to vote for Donald Trump under any circumstances, but might vote for a Republican in the Senate, and that's why Democrats are pretty nervous about the Senate right now.



BREAM: Yes. And so there's also -- there are nerves on all sides about all kinds of things. The ground game, there are worries now that the -- that the Trump campaign has outsourced some of the get-out-to-vote, door-to- door, more retail politics kind of thing.



"Wall Street Journal" says this, Republicans in swing states are rushing to shore up their ground game in the final stretch of the campaign, fearing that former President Donald Trump's outsourcing strategy has faltered and won't drive enough voters to the polls in key battlegrounds."



Jeremy, you know, we can talk about these specific voting blocks and groups all day long, but if they do not get off the couch, register and actually vote, that's what matters.



HUNT: That's exactly right. I mean -- so I mean, I'm from Georgia and we are getting tons of ads. I mean, you look at the --



BREAM: Nonstop, I'm sure.



HUNT: Nonstop. I get texts constantly from random numbers like, please leave me alone. And if you text, no, it does not work.



BREAM: You too. Yes.



HUNT: But anyway, you know, but that's because, you know, we're in a swing state. But none of that matters if you don't get people to, you know, actually vote.



You can pump hundreds of millions of dollars into ads, hundreds of millions of dollars into, you know, text campaigns, digital, all those things. It does not matter if you can't get people to actually register and then go vote.



One thing that we've seen, especially in my home state of Georgia, I've talked to a lot of the leaders who are -- who have specifically focused on this issue, not just this year, but for the last several years trying to see how do we improve the ground game, how do we improve the door knocking.



So I'm confident in, you know, in my home state. I think there are other states where it's, you know, there are some concerns and just some of the, you know, some of the relationships between the different party leaders.



I think it's going to be important for Republicans to be able to come together and actually employ a ground game that makes a difference on election day, because we know that Vice President Harris has legions of folks, you know, who are -- who are going out there and are -- and are very well-versed in the ground game. So -- but that's what it comes down to. And I think we have to be able to perfect on that.



BREAM: Well, and not that there aren't nerves on the other side, because here's some of the headlines about Democrats, how they're feeling. Reuters, "Harris campaign shifts strategy as anxiety rises over Trump gains." "New York Post," Pennsylvania dem's rip campaign, Harris campaign just weeks before election, calling it AWOL, being out-messaged. "POLITICO" says, "Dems see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in Pennsylvania."



Josh, quick comment from you on that.



KRAUSHAAR: Yes. Look, actions speak as loudly as polls. And when you have Kamala Harris trying to reach out to African-American men in the final few weeks of a campaign, it shows she's worried about her base.



When she's trying to win over Republicans, she's going to be in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney this week. Maybe she needs that extra boost from an unusual constituency to push her over the top.



It does seem like after avoiding the press for so much of the campaign, she's been doing a whole lot of interviews. On one hand, that's a good thing. I'm glad she's talking and doing interviews.



On the other hand, it shows she's need a -- she needs to make up some ground and she's worried about where the polls show.



BREAM: Well, she is welcome to come on FOX NEWS SUNDAY, anytime.



OK. Panel, don't go far.



Just days after the leader -- after IDF took out the leader of Hamas, Israel's prime minister is facing new pressure to wrap up the war in Gaza. We'll take you live to Israel and then debates.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



BREAM: The conflict between Israel and Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Gaza continue to escalate despite hopes that the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar might restart peace negotiations.



Trey Yingst joins us live from northern Israel with the very latest.



Hello, Trey.



TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Shannon, good morning.



The northern front heated up this weekend with Hezbollah launching hundreds of rockets over the border and Israel resuming air strikes against Beirut. Smoke could be seen rising from the Lebanese capital as Israeli fighter jets targeted the Dafia (ph) neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold. Large explosions could be felt throughout the city as the Iran-backed group vowed in recent days to keep fighting Israel and escalate its attacks.



That's exactly what we've seen on the ground with an uptick in rocket fire here in northern Israel. On Saturday, one man was killed by shrapnel just across the bay from our position. A Hezbollah drone also slipped passed air defense, slamming into the residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was not home at the time.



With Israeli ground forces continuing to go after Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, an additional reserve brigade has been called up to fight. New video released by the IDF shows Hezbollah's underground infrastructure being blown up. And on the southern front, that does remain active as well, with new ground fighting and strikes ongoing in northern Gaza. Two Israeli soldiers were killed, as well as dozens of Palestinians according to local reports.



Overnight, the IDF released a video showing former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a tunnel beneath Gaza with his family the day before the October 7th massacre. More information is expected to be declassified following Sinwar's death last week. With no diplomatic solution on the horizon to end the war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to the region on Tuesday for meetings.



Now, the big x factor here in ongoing ceasefire conversations is Iran. The Israelis are expected to launch an attack following the ballistic missile attack against Israel earlier this month.



Shannon.



BREAM: All right, Trey Yingst in Israel for us today.



Trey, thank you very much.



We are back now with the panel.



"The Hill" reports this about what comes next in the wake of Sinwar's death. It says, "The Biden administration has sought to craft a day after scenario for the Gaza Strip absent Hamas leadership, to include ideas of a multinational Arab security force and a Palestinian civil administration. But Netanyahu has held back on endorsing any of these ideas."



Francesca, I mean this is a real kind of legacy conversation for the Biden administration wanting to get this thing wrapped up.



CHAMBERS: And right now what the U.S. sees as the most important imperative is getting to that ceasefire deal. They believe that this is the best possible chance that they're going to have this now that Yahya Sinwar is dead, that they say there is a unique opportunity to try and get these talks restarted right now. They believe that that's the best way to get the hostages back alive at this time.



But as we talk about the ticking clock on President Biden's legacy in roughly three weeks from now, either Vice President Kamala Harris will win this election and that will be largely viewed as a reaffirmation of President Biden's worldview, or Donald Trump will win this election and it will be interpreted as a rejection of Biden's worldview and foreign policy.



So, whatever President Biden is going to do, he's got a short amount of time to do it. And that's partly why you saw him overseas this past week in Germany.



BREAM: Yes, our colleague, Andy McCarthy, writing over at "National Reviews" says this about this administration's attempt to try to persuade folks in the Middle East to follow their vision.



They say, "Attempts by the American administration and its fellow progressives in European chancelleries to stop Israel from conclusively defeating the jihadists only ensure that the world will continue and many more hostages will be taken."



They suggest, Marie, deference to Netanyahu, who has been executing this thing in a way he wants to, taking out the leadership of Hezbollah and Hamas. Stand back and let him do his thing.



HARF: Well, I mean, to be clear, the reason Israel - one of the main reasons has been able to have such success against Hamas and Hezbollah is the large amount of American weaponry that the Biden administration has continued to send them, even in the face of some significant, I think misguided, but significant domestic political pressure. So, the U.S. has stood by Israel throughout this entire process.



Tony Blinken, right now, is negotiating with the Israelis, with Ron Dermer, a key Netanyahu ally, with the Emiratis, and the Saudis and the Egyptians to try and come up with a day after plan. What does Gaza look like without Hamas in charge? How do you get to a place where Israel is secure, there is no terrorist threat coming from Gaza, where the hostages importantly, including American hostages, can come home? And there is a different path forward for the Palestinian people, who have suffered in Gaza tremendously as we know.



And so I agree that there's a small window here, but I think that at least some Netanyahu confidants and the Arab states are now focused on what this might look like. And when President Trump goes on stage and says he's calling Prime Minister Netanyahu, telling him not to listen to Biden, trying to get him involved in our political election, that is a very concerning thing for those of us who believe support for Israel should be bipartisan and should be an honest and open conversation and not part of our political game here.



BREAM: Well, and there's been a lot of conversation this week about a letter that went over - "Axios" reporting on this letter from Secretaryies Blinken and Austin to Israeli leaders saying, "The Biden administration sent the letter to Israeli leaders Monday demanding Israel take steps within 30 days to improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza or risk the supply of U.S. weapons to Israel being affected."



I mean, Josh, that - that happening before Sinwar was taken out.



KRAUSHAAR: Yes, there's been sort of a schizophrenic approach where I agree with Marie that the Biden administration and its policy has been largely supportive of Israel, but every so often you hear these - this pressures coming from the administration that they need to put more humanitarian aid into Gaza, that they are worried about any strike against Iran, which is continuing to be - to dominate the news. And also the issue of Rafah. The administration, Biden and Harris both in the spring told Netanyahu, don't go into Rafah, which is where Sinwar was found, and which is where some of the most effective counter-terrorism operations have taken place since then.



So, that's - that's - that's the challenge. They've been worried about escalation, but they also have affected the Israeli's ability to do - and finish the job.



BREAM: A quick, final word to you, Jeremy.



HUNT: Yes, I mean, that's exactly right. I mean thank God that Israel did not listen to the - to the Biden-Harris administration on this saying don't go into Rafah. We had all the social media, all eyes on Rafah. Well, guess what, we know now that Sinwar was hiding, like a coward, hiding among civilians there. And thank God that Israel still went in. They've been decisive, even though this Biden White House has been indecisive from the start.



BREAM: Well, and, Marie, as you mentioned, Secretary Blinken is there and trying to get the talks restarted and getting those hostages home is the priority.



Panel, thank you very much. We will see you next Sunday.



Up next, world-renowned chimpanzee expert Dr. Jane Goodall has spent decades as a research pioneer. As she turns 90, she is not slowing down. My conversation with her, next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



BREAM: Dr. Jane Goodall, known for her pioneering research with chimpanzees, says her priority now is to inspire the next generation. I talked with Dr. Goodall about her life's work. It is our Sunday special.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



JANE GOODALL, PRIMATOLOGIST: We need young people to grow up knowing about the importance of the environment.



BREAM (voice over): As a child, Dr. Jane Goodall knew she wanted to work with animals. Inspired by the book "Tarzan," she decided she wanted to travel to Africa.



GOODALL: I saved up the money being a waitress. Finally got there and met the late Lewis Liki (ph). He wanted someone to study chimpanzees. I'm the first person every. And that study led to understanding the need to conserve chimpanzees and their forest habitat with everything living in it.



BREAM (voice over): In 1960, at just 26, and despite pushback over her lack of experience, Goodall began observing chimpanzees in the wild, with not much more than binoculars and a notebook.



Over the last 60 years, Goodall became one the world's leading primatologists and conservationist, pioneering groundbreaking research, including the discovery that chimps make and use tools.



GOODALL: Everything in nature is interrelated. So, the importance of biodiversity, the mixture of species that make up an ecosystem.



BREAM (voice over): In 1977, the Jane Goodall Institute was founded to broaden chimpanzee research and protection, conserve their environments and educate local communities and the world.



At age 90, Goodall isn't slowing down, continuing to inspire and teach younger generations.



GOODALL: And so that's led to me traveling the world 300 days a year and meeting with people, giving lectures, meeting decisionmakers, talking to young people.



BREAM (voice over): Goodall is also spearheading the Vote Nature Initiative.



GOODALL: Voting nature. Yes, a vote is important. Look at the candidates and ask yourself, which one is most likely to care about my future. And so, you know, I've been going around with - with this sign just telling people, vote for nature. That's your future. It's the future of your children and their children. And it's the future of the very planet on which we depend.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



BREAM: Dr. Goodall's life and work are also the subject of an award-winning new documentary entitled "Reasons for Hope."



That is it for us today. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Shannon Bream. Have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.

Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair with President Bill Clinton shook the nation, is now offering 25 ways to “calm the f—k down” before the election — including an eyebrow-raising recommendation to relieve stress by reading literature on feminism and abortion and through having “sex” — a suggestion seen as tone-deaf given her own controversial past.

In a recent piece in Vanity Fair, Lewinsky offers a slew of tips to ease election season stress, covering topics from playing board games to spending time outdoors. However, her closing recommendation — a suggestion to use sex as a “distraction” — appears ill-suited given her own past.

Lewinsky, who has called for Donald Trump’s indictment, begins the essay by taking aim at the former president and the right:

I don’t know about you, but to me the Democratic convention—which took place two months ago—seems like it happened in a far-away, feel-good time warp. Ever since, the 2024 election cycle has been brutal. And barely a day goes by without some alarming MAGA-world flare-up (Donald Trump calling January 6 a “day of love”; threats of vigilantes going after FEMA workers) causing me to chew what’s left of my cuticles.

Aside from urging early voting, her election stress-busting list includes activities like mahjong, tennis, UNO, charades, New York Times Games (Wordle, Connections, crosswords), the social-bluffing game Blood on the Clocktower, coloring, large puzzles, and knitting — citing an article which suggests that “engaging in repetitive and rhythmic motions while knitting can help induce a state of relaxation and reduce stress levels.”

She also lists decluttering, costume planning, Netflix, podcasts, online courses, “danc[ing] your ass off” and “shak[ing] your booty,” meditation, activism, and reading — with recommended books focused on feminism and abortion, which she describes as “one of the most vital issues on the ballot this year.”

For political engagement, Lewinsky encourages knocking on doors, “writing postcards to swing state voters,” donating, and supporting voter mobilization groups like Vote Save America and Her Bold Move — a nonprofit which insists that “men shouldn’t be making laws about women’s bodies.”

She concludes her list with the provocative suggestion: “And if all else fails, there is always sex!”

For many Americans who look to the upcoming election as a turning point for the country, Lewinsky’s remarks feel not only trivial but poorly timed.

Amid pressing issues like inflation and public safety, her list of election distractions — including games, coloring, and even sex — has struck some as tone-deaf.

Previously she has advocated for sex worker-led funding to support advocacy, community care, and the rights and safety of sex workers.

Despite attempts to rebrand herself as a mental health advocate, Lewinsky’s name remains forever associated with one of the most infamous scandals in modern American history.

Ironically, former President Bill Clinton said that his high-profile affair with Lewinsky was one of the things he did during his presidency to “manage my anxieties,” according to The Daily Mail.
The Democratic Party needs to get competitive with Republicans in battleground North Carolina to turn out more voters before Election Day, says a former political consultant from the Tar Heel State.

Thomas Mills is publisher and founder of PoliticsNC, a website described as "Analysis, commentary, and opinion of North Carolina and national politics from the perspective of a center-left, 30-year veteran of the campaign battlefield."

Mills, who worked on the direct mail team for the Democratic National Committee in 2004, identified two problems that Democrats need to address, quickly, to compete in the state: early voting and low African American voter turnout.

"They [Republicans] seem to be on the right track right now. Democrats, on the other hand, need to boost their turnout. I mean, what we don't know is how people are voting," Mills told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. "Some of these Republicans that are going to the polls may not actually be voting for Republicans. So, until we count the votes, we don't know a whole lot."

Mills said that this cycle, Republicans are voting at "levels much higher than they have in the past."

NORTH CAROLINA VOTERS WILL DECIDE ON AMENDMENT TO EXPLICITLY BAR NONCITIZENS FROM VOTING IN ELECTIONS

"The big question is, ‘What is driving the GOTV vote this cycle?’ They [Republicans] historically have not put any emphasis in North Carolina on early voting. In fact, in 2020, they actually told Republicans not to vote early, to vote on Election Day," Mill said. "This year, they've taken a different tack. And they're actively telling Republicans to go vote early."

Mills added that Republicans appear to be leading in early voting, which started on Oct. 17, but that until every ballot is counted, the parties won't know whether these early votes represent any new voters.

"Right now, they have more votes than Democrats," he added. "The question is, are these voters that would have been voting on Election Day that are voting early, or are there new voters in the group that they're hoping are going to push their margins up?"

Early voting gives operatives the opportunity to go after less frequent voters, but North Carolina is not seeing a ton of new voters coming into the electorate this cycle, Mills said.

BALANCE OF POWER: HELENE COULD SHIFT POLITICAL WINDS TOWARD TRUMP, NORTH CAROLINA, LAWMAKERS SAY

The other key issue that could "hurt" Democrats in the battleground state, according to Mills, is low turnout among Black voters, a key voting bloc among Democrats.

"Historically, African-Americans have been a pretty major part of the Democratic coalition, and they make up somewhere around 20% of the overall vote, and they vote at roughly 90% for Democrats. And what I saw when I was looking, comparing early votes from 2020 to 2024, is, a few days ago, they were down by about 67,000 votes or so from 2020, which four days into the early vote is not a catastrophe, because there's going to be probably more than a million African Americans voting."

According to Mills, African Americans do not appear to be changing their voting behaviors, but there is rather a "depressed turnout" among the demographic.

"If Democrats want to get them in the polls, they need to start trying to figure out what those are and getting them to go vote," he said. "They have time to fix it, but they do need to figure out what the issue is, where the problems are and increase turnout."

Hurricane Helene recently made a deadly sweep across the southeast, impacting several counties in North Carolina ahead as the state was preparing for early voting to begin. Mill said he believes the event will have some effect on voter turnout, but that it won't hurt either party.

"I think when you have a natural disaster like that, it does affect turnout some because of accessibility, but more because people have either left the area because they don't have water, they don't have power, or they're just too concerned with trying to take care of basic needs," he said. "They're not thinking about voting."
A 22-year-old former Democrat National Convention (DNC) delegate has announced she is calling it quits with the Democrat party.

Audrey McNeal, who was a DNC delegate in 2020 and 2024, made the announcement Friday in a video she posted on social media, the Daily Caller reported Sunday. In the clip, McNeal said she is planning to vote for former President Donald Trump (R) and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) on Election Day, which is November 5.

“In 2020, I was elected at 18 to become one of the youngest delegates to the Democratic National Convention on behalf of my district. And in 2024, I was elected again to return to the DNC as a delegate. But this year, I’m casting my ballot for Donald Trump,” she told viewers:

McNeal continued:

You see, after I was elected in March which was before Joe Biden’s debate, I wanted to go to the DNC because I wanted answers on free speech issues, the border, and the economy. However, reflecting on my time at the DNC I realized it was no longer the party of free speech and civil liberties it used to be. In fact, Patrick Henry once said, ‘The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.’ And for the rulers of the Democratic Party elite to install Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee via stripping the vote of 14 million Americans including their own delegates such as myself, well that was a decision and a transaction that was concealed. And now I’m happy to say that I’m officially joining the Republican Party as a constitutional conservative.

It is interesting to note that recent Gallup polling showed more Americans either identify as Republicans or are more in line with the GOP than Democrats, Breitbart News reported.

In addition, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (I-HI) recently announced she is joining the Republican Party during a Trump rally in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The Breitbart News report continued:

“It is because of my love for our country and specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican Party and bring it back to the party of the people and the party of peace, that I’m proud to stand here with you today President Trump and announce that I’m joining the Republican Party,” Tulsi told the crowd. “I’m joining the party of the people, the party of equality, the party that was founded to fight against and end slavery in this country. It is the party of common sense and the party that is led by a president who has the courage and strength to fight for peace.”

Regarding McNeal’s announcement, her reference to Henry is important because he was one of America’s Founding Fathers. He is also described as a patriot, orator, governor, husband, father, grandfather, and friend, according to the website about his home known as Red Hill.

“He is best remembered for his speech given at St. John’s Church in 1775, in which he cried ‘give me liberty or give me death!’ to the charged crowd, urging them to Revolution,” the site noted.

“But he is also the man who fought for and won the Bill of Rights, which preserved individual liberties in the fledgling nation, and still does today. He was a five-term governor of Virginia, as well as its first governor,” it continued.

According to George Washington’s Mount Vernon website, “Patrick Henry was one of the bright lights of the United States’ revolutionary generation.”
Edgar Allan Poe wrote that the scariest monsters are the ones which lurk within our souls.

But what about the souls which lurk in the halls of Congress?

The U.S. Capitol is more than 200 years old. And any building which has been around for two centuries, is stocked with legends and ghosts. This time of year, people flock to pop-up haunted houses "on the hill." But when it comes to Washington, DC, there is only one haunted House (and Senate) on "the Hill." So allow me to spook you with tales of the Capitol macabre as we descend into the Congressional catacombs.

Four grand staircases occupy each quadrant of the Capitol. But the steps in the southwest portion of the building on the House side tell perhaps one of the most grotesque stories in Congress.

And we’re not talking about one of the big omnibus spending bills.

Rep. William Taulbee, D-Ky., served in Congress in the late 19th Century. And just like today, the Capitol teams with journalists, chasing lawmakers for a quotation or information about legislation. But Taulbee had a problem. Reporter Charles Kincaid wrote for the Louisville Times. Kincaid penned an article about Taulbee’s dalliances titled "Kentucky’s Silver-Tongued Taulbee Caught in Flagrante or Thereabouts."

After the article, Taulbee didn’t seek reelection but stuck around in Washington, pushing various causes – long before "K Street" became a thing. But Taulbee and Kincaid would often run into one another at the Capitol. Taulbee was a lot taller than the diminutive Kincaid and would sometimes physically harass the scribe.

The pen may be mightier than the sword. But it’s certainly not as powerful as a pistol.

In February, 1890, the two men encountered one another near the House chamber. Kincaid produced his firearm and shot the former Congressman in the face. Taulbee bled profusely as he headed down the marble stairwell.

Many lawmakers come to Washington, intent on leaving a mark on the body politic. But as it turns out, it was Taulbee’s body which left an indelible mark on the U.S. Capitol.

You see, the composition of human blood and the Georgian, white marble used to make the stairwells of the building don’t exactly mix. Splotches of Taulbee’s blood covered the staircase every few feet from the second floor to the first. Some markings look like shapes in a Rorschach test. Taulbee died the next day from his wounds. But his plasma is forever a part of the U.S. Capitol, permanently staining the staircase.

As a result of his fate, Taulbee doesn’t think much of reporters. Even to this day. And it’s believed that Taulbee sometimes makes himself known by tripping members of the Congressional press corps.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the Capitol in the summer of 2019. He had just met with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. However, word broke that day that the attendance-starved Tampa Bay Rays might try to work out an agreement to play some of their home games in Montreal. The Montreal Expos abandoned Canada in 2005 to become the Washington Nationals.

Trudeau was a fan of the Expos. There’s even a picture of a boyish Trudeau in the stands at Olympic Stadium in Montreal with his father, late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

It would be a scoop if the younger Trudeau weighed-in on the prospects of Major League Baseball returning to Montreal.

Trudeau walked down a spiral staircase not far from where Kincaid killed Taulbee. I tried to get a comment from Trudeau. But for no apparent reason, I tripped over the lip of a step and cascaded in front of the Canadian leader. I didn’t drop the microphone. I also knew that I could break my arm or hand if I tried to catch myself.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER

Fortunately, I studied martial arts for years. One of the things they teach you is how to fall. I quickly adjusted my weight so I plunged onto my right shoulder and rolled. My feet flew up in the air. This was all caught on tape by my photographer Robert Fetzer.

"Oh Chad! Chad! Chad! Chad," yelled Fetzer, as I plopped directly in front of Trudeau.

I was uninjured and Trudeau extended an arm to assist me. But I had already sprang back to my feet. Alas, Trudeau didn’t answer my question about the Rays and Montreal and went on his way.

But there was no logical reason why I tripped there. I’ve stood by those stairs hundreds of times. I’ve never been caught by the lip of the lower stairs.

A possible explanation?



Perhaps the ghost of William Taulbee saw to it that I keister over teakettle in front of the Canadian Prime Minister.

CANADIAN PM TRUDEAU SAYS 'THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO' AS HIS PARTY LOSES LONG-HELD SEAT IN QUEBEC

However, there is only one Capitol haunting which surpasses the Taulbee tripping tale.

But only by a whisker.

It’s the legend of the demon cat.

Capitol Police officers and even 19th century watchmen claim they’ve seen a phantasmic feline prowl the hallways of the Capitol before national emergencies. Especially war and assassinations.

Purr-portedly.

That said, no one spotted the demon cat before 9/11 or the 2021 Capitol riot.

CONTINGENT ELECTIONS: WHAT THEY ARE, AND WHAT TO EXPECT IF 2024 TRIGGERS ONE

Maybe the demon cat – like all cats – only has nine lives.

But I can take you to a place where the demon cat is said to have walked.

Go to the first floor of the "mini" Rotunda on the Senate side of the Capitol near the Old Supreme Court chamber. If you learn against one of the columns near that room and look down, you might just see several paw prints permanently etched into the floor. However, the light must catch the prints just right. You could stand right on top of the prints and never spy them.

Supposedly the demon cat signed its initials in an obscure Senate stairwell in the basement. Scrawled into the concrete are the initials "DC."

However, this evidence is up to interpretation. Could the DC stand for "District of Columbia?" How about "direct current?" Maybe even, "Detective Comics."

I warned you we would descend into the Congressional cat-acombs.

AMERICAN CULTURE QUIZ: TEST YOURSELF ON HIT TV SHOWS, SPORTS STARS AND HALLOWEEN

The Capitol features a cornucopia of stories about spooky voices, departed workers singing late at night and even one tale of a senator rocking in a chair, reading legislation. The Capitol Rotunda and Statuary Hall (the old House chamber) are dotted with life-life renderings of statesmen, inventors, heroes and scientists. It is said that after midnight the statues sometimes come alive to debate one another.

In the House of Representatives, that’s not a "Special Order" speech but a "Spectral Order."

But sometimes the best ghosts in the Capitol are the ones you conjure in your mind’s eye. Abraham Lincoln sitting at a desk toward the back of the old House chamber. Lyndon Johnson roaming the Senate floor. Scenes of presidential inaugurations from years gone by at the Capitol.

The ghosts of the republic in fact haunt the halls of Congress.

And in many cases, those phantasms aren’t ghosts.

They’re American history.
Vice President Kamala Harris is back in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, where she spoke before a Philadelphia church congregation and subsequently came under fire from social media commenters for allegedly unveiling a "new accent" during the event.

"BREAKING: Kamala Harris unveils a new accent at a black Philadelphia church," popular conservative X account "End Wokeness" posted Sunday accompanied by video of Harris at the event.

Harris traveled to the Church of Christian Compassion in Philadelphia on Sunday morning, where she spoke to the predominantly Black congregants, telling them that in just nine days, voters will "have the power to decide the fate of our nation for generations to come."

"Here in Pennsylvania, right now each of us has an opportunity to make a difference. Because in this moment we do face a real question. What kind of country do we want to live in?" she said. "The great thing about living in a democracy is we the people have the choice to answer that question. So let us answer not just with our words, but with our works."

HARRIS MOCKED ONLINE FOR BREAKING OUT ANOTHER 'NEW ACCENT' AT CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS EVENT

Harris cited the Book of Psalms in her remarks, including saying: "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the mornin’. The path may seem hard, the work may seem heavy, but joy cometh in the mornin’ and church morning is on its way."

Critics on social media pounced on clips of Harris quoting Psalms, saying she debuted a new "pastor" accent, comparing her inflection to Martin Luther King's tenor.

KAMALA HARRIS RALLIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY REPEATING SAME SPEECH IN DIFFERENT ACCENTS

Harris has previously been accused by critics of unveiling new "accents" while on the campaign trail, including one last month when she spoke before the Congressional Black Caucus, and another "accent" that was compared to "Foghorn Leghorn" during a Labor Day rally in Detroit when she spoke to blue-collar union workers.

"Since when does the vice president have what sounds like a Southern accent?" Fox News' Peter Doocy asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last month following her Detroit speech that was compared to the "Foghorn Leghorn" cartoon character.

WHITE HOUSE DISMISSES QUESTIONS ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS' NEW 'SOUTHERN ACCENT:' 'JUST INSANE'

"I have no idea what you’re talking about," Jean-Pierre replied.

"Well, she was talking about unions in Detroit using one tone of voice, she used the same line in Pittsburgh, and it sounded like she at least had some kind of Southern drawl," Doocy pressed.

KAMALA HARRIS CALLED OUT FOR 'STRANGE' ACCENT: 'IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE'

"I mean, do you hear the question that you’re – I mean, do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?" Jean-Pierre pushed back. "You know what they care about? They care about the economy, they care about lowering costs, they care about health care. That’s what they want to hear… democracy and freedom… I’m not going to even entertain some question about… it’s just. Hearing it sounds so ridiculous. The question – I’m talking about the question – is just insane."

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign regarding the Philadelphia speech and critics who lambasted the VP for unveiling the "new accent," but did not immediately receive a reply on Sunday afternoon.

Pennsylvania is again a key battleground state this election cycle, after Trump won the state in his successful presidential election in 2016, and President Biden claimed the state in 2020. Both Trump and Harris have repeatedly crisscrossed the state in recent months as they work to lock up votes in the state that will likely determine the overall outcome of the election.

Harris will hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia later Sunday, while Trump will join a rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden Sunday evening.
Former President Donald Trump will hold a massive campaign rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden on Sunday, – just nine days before voters cast their ballots.

The event, which was first-come, first-serve, sold out within hours of being announced.

The 19,500-seat venue is home of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers.

The Trump campaign says the program includes political icons, celebrities, musical artists, and friends and family of former President Trump who will all discuss how he is "the best choice to fix everything that Kamala Harris broke."

ELON MUSK, DANA WHITE TO APPEAR AT 'HISTORIC' TRUMP MSG RALLY

"This epic event, in the heart of President Trump's home city, will be a showcase of the historic political movement that President Trump has built in the final days of the campaign," the campaign said in a press release.

Elon Musk and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White will attend the rally Sunday.

Musk has already hit the campaign trail for Trump, delivering a memorable speech in Butler, Pennsylvania , earlier this month, when the former president returned to the same site where an assassination attempt was made on his life on July 13.

White, who has been a close friend of Trump for years and played a role in him reestablishing the mixed martial arts company in the early 2000s, introduced the former president at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, telling the crowd the stakes have never been higher .

Other notable attendees this Sunday include former Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, political commentator Tucker Carlson and former Democrat presidential nominee turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard.

High-profile names from the political world include Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.

TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY AT NEW YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY

Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump as well as the former president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will also feature.

From the music world, Death Row Records founder Michael Harris Jr. is set to appear, as will singer Lee Greenwood and opera singer Christopher Macchio.

The Garden hosted the Republican National Convention (RNC) in 2004 and the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in 1924, 1976, 1980 and 1992.

Then-President Ronald Reagan, in his 1984 re-election landslide, was the last Republican to carry New York in a White House race.

"We're making a play for New Jersey. We're making a play for Virginia," Trump said at a rally earlier this month, before adding that he's also aiming to compete in Minnesota and New Mexico.

Earlier this year, during a campaign stop at an Upper Manhattan bodega, Trump said he would "straighten out New York."

"We're going to come in — number one, you have to stop crime, and we're going to let the police do their job. They have to be given back their authority. They have to be able to do their job," Trump said. "And we're going to come into New York. We're making a big play for New York, other cities, too. But this city, I love this city."

This will be Trump’s second big rally in the state of New York.

Trump held a rally at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, Long Island, last month. More than 60,000 tickets were requested, far exceeding the venue's 16,000-seat capacity. Thousands of supporters who were not admitted to the venue watched him speak on large screens outside.

TRUMP ADVISER UNPACKS WHY FORMER PRESIDENT IS HOLDING RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE STATE WEEKS FROM ELECTION

Trump also held a rally in the Bronx over the summer at Crotona Park, which had a permit allowance of 3,500 people. The New York Post reported the Bronx rally drew up to 10,000 supporters.

Meanwhile, more than 20,000 people attended his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend.

The campaign also said they saw more than 100,000 people at the former president’s rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, in May.

Trump previously said New York has "gotten so bad in the last three years, four years."

"And we're going to straighten New York out. So running for president, we're putting a big hit in New York — we could win New York," Trump said.

While it is unlikely deep blue New York flips red in the White House race, another rally in the state may help Republicans down the ballot as they try to hold on to their House of Representatives majority in November's elections.
On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson stated that he guarantees that if 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump wins the 2024 election and implements a mass deportation policy, it will “turbocharge the sanctuary city movement in blue state, blue city communities, just like it did during Trump” and before the Trump administration, which will make it harder to go after people who are real dangers to national security and public safety.

Johnson stated, [relevant remarks begin around 6:45] “When we talk about mass deportation, that’s, frankly — that’s a bumper sticker. You have to have priorities. The criminal gang members from Venezuela, I want to see ICE ERO out there focusing, looking for those guys versus focusing on somebody who has been in this country twelve years, who runs a bakery somewhere, who hasn’t committed any crimes, who has got U.S. kids born in this country.”

Co-host Lawrence Jones then cut in to say, “Mr. Secretary, they can’t, because there are sanctuary [cities] that have non-detainer status. And so, when those ICE officials try to go there, you have Democrat cities that run those departments and say, no, we’re not going to cooperate with you.”

Johnson responded, “And if you embark on a policy of mass deportation in this country, that will, I guarantee, turbocharge the sanctuary city movement in blue state, blue city communities, just like it did during Trump, during — and even before Trump. And so, the key in going after public safety threats, national security threats, is working effectively with local law enforcement, so when they’re released from local jails, they go straight into ICE custody.”

Leftists suffered a meltdown Friday after the editors of the Washington Post announced they would no longer endorse in presidential races starting with this year’s contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

“The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election,” read a note from the Post’s publisher and editor-in-chief, William Lewis. “We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.”

The decision to refrain from making a presidential endorsement this year means Harris will be the first Democrat on the ticket in more than 30 years not to receive the explicit support of the D.C. paper’s editorial board. In September, Harris also became the first candidate for president who failed to receive the endorsement from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters which has endorsed every Democrat since 2000.

Washington Post presidential endorsements by year:



• 1992: Clinton🟦

• 1996: Clinton🟦

• 2000: Gore🟦

• 2004: Kerry🟦

• 2008: Obama🟦

• 2012: Obama🟦

• 2016: Clinton🟦

• 2020: Biden🟦

• 2024: NO ENDORSEMENT🚨



This is devastating news for Kamala Harris. — Corey A. DeAngelis, school choice evangelist (@DeAngelisCorey) October 25, 2024

The Washington Post’s announcement Friday was met with outrage among left-wing readers and columnists, including several who write for the paper.

“Jesus christ,” wrote Post columnist Karen Attiah on X just minutes after her paper’s announcement.

Jesus christ. — Karen Attiah (@KarenAttiah) October 25, 2024

In another post to X, Attiah shared a statement she signed with more than a dozen other columnists for the Washington Post demanding the editors endorse Vice President Harris.

“This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020,” wrote the 17 opinion columnists. “An independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn’t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution.”

The joint statement was signed by Max Boot and Jennifer Rubin, the latter of whom had just cheered the resignation of a Los Angeles Times editor two days prior when the west coast publication similarly declined to endorse in this year’s presidential contest.

“I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,” said LA Times editorials editor Mariel Garza in an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.”

“Bravo. All respect,” Rubin wrote on X in respond to Garza. “and where are the rest of them?”

Federalist Senior Editor Mark Hemingway wrote, “now that [Washington Post] is not endorsing, resigning from the paper seems like the honorable thing for [Rubin] to do.”

The Washington Post’s union guild also published a statement that staff were “deeply concerned” about the paper’s decision not to issue a formal endorsement.

“According to our own reporters and Guild members, an endorsement for Harris was already drafted, and the decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos,” the Guild said. “We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers.”

“Star Wars” actor Mark Hammil was similarly incredulous about the Washington Post’s no-endorsement this election cycle and posted a screenshot on X of a canceled subscription.

“Just canceled the newspaper that told us ‘Democracy Dies In Darkness,” Hammill wrote, calling on his more than 5 million followers to do the same.

They’re doing to Elon Musk in 2024 what they did to Mike Flynn in 2017. Now as then, it’s a direct challenge to the rule of law and to democratic procedure. And yes, Donald Trump, too, is a target, albeit indirectly.

On October 24, the Wall Street Journal headlined, “Exclusive: Elon Musk’s Secret Conversations With Vladimir Putin: Regular contacts between world’s richest man and America’s chief antagonist raise security concerns.”

The article detailed alleged conversations between Musk and Putin on such ultra-sensitive matters as whether or not Musk’s Starlink satellites can connect to Taiwan, and various proposals for settling the Russia-Ukraine war. As of this writing, the Russians have denied the story, and Musk has had no comment.

Yet assuming the conversations are true and are being characterized accurately, a key question jumps out: How did the Journal get this information?

The article is bylined no fewer than five reporters, citing “American, European, and Russian sources.” It’s possible that these quotes could have been pieced together by people in the room, second-hand memoranda of conversations, and so on. However, the simplifying and clarifying logic of Occam’s Razor suggests that the most likely source is intercepts. That is, wiretaps—someone with technological means listening in.

Such intercepts are done routinely, world-wide, by the National Security Agency (NSA). Back in 2013, we learned just how comprehensive and effective this surveillance can be from the disclosures of Edward Snowden, an American NSA contractor who then fled to Russia, where he lives to this day. One needn’t approve of Snowden’s treacherous actions to acknowledge the bottom line: The NSA strives to listen to everything, anywhere, all the time.

Can the U.S. government really do all this? Is Uncle Sam that good? That’s unclear. Yet reports hold that the Kremlin is using analogue typewriters—you know, with clacking keys and ribbons—as a way of safeguarding its secrets from electronic eavesdropping. Yet “snail mail” devices do less good if leaders still communicate on the telephone or by webcam.

Meanwhile other countries—starting with Russia, but also including China and Israel—are constantly questing for similar interception capabilities. It’s likely, too, that some corporations have developed their own capability. Mark Zuckerberg, who should know, puts tape over the built-in camera on his personal devices.

On October 25 came reports that foreign malefactors had targeted the phones used by top officials in both presidential campaigns, including the candidates. With what effect? Nobody knows–at least not yet.

Yes, it’s an endless game of cat-and-mouse, all conducted in a wilderness of mirrors. (We should also keep in mind that tales of technological wizardry can be misdirection, designed to cloak the reality that humint is actually doing the skullduggery. After all, if counter-intelligence authorities are convinced they should be hunting for a tech bug, they might be overlooking the human mole.)

So if the sources and methods are murky, we’re left to ponder another aspect of the Journal’s October 24 scoop: the motive. Here we can apply the the question even older than the Romans: cui bono? That is, follow the principle that he who benefits from an act is the most likely cause of the act.

So who would benefit from hurting Musk? Since Musk has emerged as a full-auto MAGA Trump supporter, it’s easy enough to deduce that the strongest motive is with the Biden-Harris administration. After all, it wishes to see Kamala Harris win the upcoming election (with perhaps a few exceptions who don’t count much anymore).

Toward that goal, hitting Musk might help. As of now, it’s impossible to prove or disprove this hypothesis, and yet the current fact-pattern endorses it—as does a past fact-pattern.

That pattern—the “intelligence community” disrupting a Donald Trump-related process, with Russians in the mix—showed itself nearly a decade ago, during the two-month transition between the Obama and Trump presidencies.

On November 18, 2016, the president-elect named retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn to be his national security adviser. But then, on January 12, 2017, The Washington Post reported, “According to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29,” to speak of classified matters. The tone of the story was that this was a bombshell. The Post warned darkly about violations of the Logan Act and other potential breaches of law and national security.

Back then, this author smelled a rat. A few days later, here at Breitbart News, I observed, “Trump administration officials are getting the Deep State treatment.” Focusing on the question as how the Post got wind of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations—which surely came from intercepts—I added, “Such disclosures aren’t legal, but once again, nobody in Washington, D.C., seems to care.”

This was, of course, during the time that “Russiagate” accusations were flying. Amidst that frenzy, Flynn was driven out of the White House after just three weeks. Later that same year, 2017, he pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak. Flynn’s view of the case, shared by experts, is that he was entrapped by James Comey and his “Crossfire Hurricane” operation. (On November 25, 2020, Trump pardoned Flynn.)

Thinking back on that time, when Trump was struggling against the Deep State, we should recall Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) cynical comment to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow: “Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” Speaking of Trump, Schumer continued, “So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he’s being really dumb to do this.”

Of course, what Schumer called “dumb,” others would call “courageous,” Trump fighting the good fight.

Today, another gutsy businessman, Elon Musk, find himself targeted. Only instead of the Washington Post, it’s now the Wall Street Journal. The latter newspaper is owned, of course by Rupert Murdoch, who has been mostly hostile to Trump.

And while Murdoch’s views of Musk are less clear, it seems fair to speculate that the media mogul isn’t pleased to see Musk helping Trump.

Indeed, Murdoch could well be personally jealous of Musk, now that Musk’s X site has eclipsed the Journal, and also Fox News, as the leading vehicle for right-leaning opinion and activism. (Another Murdoch property, the New York Post, has endorsed Trump, although only after a quest to find a different Republican presidential candidate.)

So what will happen in the wake of the Journal story? Already, the usual suspects are jumping on it. Alexander Vindman declared, “Elon is just another useful idiot for Putin and the Russian security services to deploy.” Vindman added, “The problem is Elon has access to many national secrets.” Keith Olbermann called for the federal government to sever all links to Musk.

Without a doubt, plenty of lefty lawyers—including some at the U.S. Department of Justice—are combing through the Journal story with an eye toward some sort of legal action. And of course, we don’t know what, if anything, the Journal has yet to drop.

In the meantime, righty lawyers—including those who work for Republicans lawmakers on Capitol Hill—might be asking questions of their own: First, is it smart for U.S. government agencies to be tipping off the world as to their surveillance capabilities? Second, it is it legal to violate the privacy of Elon Musk American citizen? Third, is the intel community once again seeking to influence a presidential election? That’s illegal, even though it seems to happen a lot.

Former President Donald Trump and podcast host Joe Rogan covered a lot of ground in a sprawling three-hour conversation released online Friday night, but they kept returning to election integrity issues.

They spoke several times about mail-in ballots and voter identification. The United States should return to all paper ballots, Trump said. When ballots go through the mail, things can get “messed up,” he said, adding that paper ballots are less expensive than voting machines.

Trump and Rogan both questioned why anyone would not want a law that requires voters to show identification before they vote.

“It is one of the most bizarre and polarizing ideas that’s promoted by the left,” Rogan said.

The only reason they don’t want voter ID, Trump said, is because Democrats want to cheat.

“It is the only thing that makes sense,” Rogan said in agreement. At times like this, they finished each other’s sentences.

Voters don’t want Democrat policies like open borders and men playing in women’s sports, Trump said, adding voters never ask him to implement those policies.

“We have to have fair elections,” Trump said, so voters can live under the policies they want.

So-called election denial was a common posture among losing Democrats in the past, Rogan said. Hillary Clinton and Al Gore believed they won past races. In the years since the 2016 election, Clinton has continued to claim she was robbed of the presidential seat calling Trump an “illegitimate president.”

Hillary Clinton: "Trump knows he's an illegitimate president." pic.twitter.com/Ru3ktSgi5T — The Hill (@thehill) October 6, 2019

“Look at these sleaze bags in Congress that are Democrats, they’re still denying 2016,” Trump said.

Election Fraud has become a forbidden topic, Rogan said, and anyone who talks about it is in danger of being labeled an election denier, but many Americans feel something was amiss in the 2020 election.

“If you ask me, ‘What is the amount of election fraud in this country, is it 0 percent?’ No one thinks it’s 0 percent, Rogan said. I’ve never met one person — not a super liberal or a right-wing conservative — not one person thinks it’s 0 percent.”

Rogan then asked Trump to explain his views on the 2020 election.

“You’ve said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020. How do you think you were robbed?” Rogan said. “Everybody always cuts you off, but I’m going to allow you to talk.”

Some voting rules were changed without legislative approval, Trump said, mentioning extending the voting time, and counties receiving unsigned ballots as examples.

The FBI denied that Hunter Biden’s laptop belonged to him, calling it Russian misinformation.

“You say you have all this evidence that 2020 was rigged. Why haven’t you put this evidence in a consumable form?” Rogan asked.

Trump said there have been books written on it.

“We have an author named Hemingway, who is a great writer,” Trump said. “She wrote a book on it,” referring to The Federalist’s Editor in Chief, Mollie Hemingway, and her book Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized our elections.

Often critics say Trump’s complaints about the election results were heard in court, but Trump said judges never heard the merits of the cases.

“They would say, ‘You don’t have standing,” Trump said. They didn’t rule on the merits. The merits never got there. The judges didn’t have what it took to turn it over.”

The FBI denied that Hunter Biden’s laptop belonged to him, calling it Russian misinformation.

“You say you have all this evidence that 2020 was rigged. Why haven’t you put this evidence in a consumable form?” Rogan asked.

Trump said there have been books written on it.

“We have an author named Hemingway, who is a great writer,” Trump said. “She wrote a book on it,” referring to The Federalist’s Editor in Chief, Mollie Hemingway, and her book Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized our elections.

Often critics say Trump’s complaints about the election results were heard in court, but Trump said judges never heard the merits of the cases.

“They would say, ‘You don’t have standing,” Trump said. They didn’t rule on the merits. The merits never got there. The judges didn’t have what it took to turn it over.”

Beth Brelje is an elections correspondent for The Federalist. She is an award-winning investigative journalist with decades of media experience.
Late-night comedian Stephen Colbert to Vice President Kamala Harris: “Polling shows a lot of people, especially independent voters, really want this to be a change election. And that they tend to break for you in terms of thinking about change. You are a member of the present administration. Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?”

Harris: “Sure. Well, I mean, I’m obviously not Joe Biden.”

Colbert: “I noticed.”

Harris: “And so that would be one change. Also, I think it’s important to say, with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump. And so, when we think about the significance of what this next generation of leadership looks like were I to be elected president, it is about — frankly, I love the American people and I believe in our country. I love that it is our character and nature to be an ambitious people. You know, we have aspirations, we have dreams, we are — we have incredible work ethic.”

Not exactly music to the ears of the 79% of likely voters who according to a recent Marquette University poll think the country is on the “wrong track.” (RELATED: LARRY ELDER: There’s A Reason Why Kamala Harris Is Able To Run Away From Interviews)

When it comes to trust, voters give the edge to Harris over former President Donald Trump. This is why Harris’ alleged summer job at McDonald’s becomes relevant. Will she not only renounce previous positions on things like fracking, Medicare for all, promising to sign a reparations bill, and mandating the ending of the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, but to make herself more relatable, will she fabricate a job at a burger joint?

Harris said nothing about working at McDonald’s when she ran for district attorney, attorney general of California, the U.S Senate or when she ran for president last election cycle. She wrote nothing about this experience in her books (more about this later). But suddenly, she remembers she once tossed fries at McDonald’s.

But, with apologies to Wendy’s, where’s the beef? Trump, “without evidence,” wrote The New York Times, accuses Harris of lying. Trump, who staged a clever photo op by cooking fries and working the drive-through window at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, said: “It was a big part of her resume that she worked at McDonald’s — how tough a job it was. She … made the french fries, and she talked about the heat: ‘It was so tough.’ She’s never worked at McDonald’s.”

If Trump said he fed pigeons in Central Park, The New York Times would demand proof and assign a battery of reporters to debunk his story. But when it comes to Harris’ McDonald’s tale, the burden of proof switches to Trump. Where’s her evidence? She offers none, other than her suddenly and conveniently rediscovered fond memories. McDonald’s offered no corroboration: “[We] and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s …”

What next? Will Democrats demand Trump be indicted for working at McDonald’s without a hairnet and pressure President Joe Biden into appointing a special prosecutor?

Harris describes her upbringing as “middle-class.” But according to The Daily Signal, this daughter of a tenured Stanford economics professor father and biochemist mother got admitted to law school under a program for students with “educational disadvantage, economic hardship, or disability.” What? And she wants student loan forgiveness on top of reparations? (RELATED: LARRY ELDER: Why Kamala Harris Is The Grim Future Of The Democrat Party)

As to Harris’ book and accusations of plagiarism, The Telegraph writes: “Kamala Harris has become embroiled in a second plagiarism row after she was accused of copying a Republican’s congressional testimony. The vice-president was last week accused of taking more than a dozen sections of her book ‘Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer’ from other sources, including a story once told by Martin Luther King Jr.”

“Now, fresh allegations have emerged that the former prosecutor lifted more than 1,000 words from the testimony of a Republican state attorney when called as a witness before Congress,” the report continued.

Not good days before the election.

This brings us to Harris’ home state newspaper, the Los Angeles Times. After endorsing every Democratic presidential candidate since 2008, the paper has declined to endorse her. It made no endorsement.

But at least the Times did not call her “the black face of white supremacy.”

The enthusiasm in Arizona is palpable as Republicans boast a voter registration advantage, Senate candidate Kari Lake said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday, predicting a “big number of Democrats” will come out for former President Donald Trump.

“From what I understand, the Republicans actually have their greatest advantage ever in voter registration against Democrats,” host Matthew Boyle observed. “It’s in Arizona. It’s a 6.8 percent lead in voter registration. But, I mean, I think that shows that America First, this movement, is making the Republican Party stronger than it’s ever been before.”

“It’s a huge lead, nearly seven percent lead over Democrats,” Lake said, identifying Arizona as a Republican state, as the people have “wrapped their arms around this America First agenda, because we’ve seen how it worked.”

She said the people of her state, particularly, are “feeling the effects of this Kamala Harris regime.”

“We’re feeling it the worst. It’s the hardest on us because we have a wide open border, and we don’t have anybody in the governor’s office doing anything about it. We still have people pouring across our border. We have the inflation that’s hit us one of the hardest in the nation, especially in places like Phoenix and Mesa and Tucson, where housing prices and rent prices have shot up. We’re on the top. Those three cities are in the top ten for rent prices going up high in this country. And so we’re really feeling the effects of that,” she said, explaining that they are also feeling the effects of crime.

“We’ve watched crime spike. We have the fastest growing homeless population in the country, here in Arizona,” she said, explaining that she fears it will worsen if Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats win.

“And I fear, by the way, we’re going to see the homeless population skyrocket if Kamala Harris were to win, because there’s so many people who are just hanging by a thread right now. They can barely get through the week with this economy in the shape that it’s in, and I fear that some really good, hardworking people are going to fall into homelessness if we don’t turn things around,” she said.

“So we are embracing the America First movement. We saw how great President Trump was. He gave us a good economy, he gave us a strong border and safe streets. And we really want to get back to that here in Arizona and … as your senator, I’m going to embrace that America First agenda as well and help President Trump get that through, so that all of our lives can be made better,” Lake promised.

She and host Matt Boyle also discussed the early voting numbers in her state.

“In terms of — first off, the Republicans are leading, but it’s also a swing of nearly 20 points. I think it’s like 17 percent or something on that away from the Democrats, towards the Republicans as compared with the 2020 election,” Boyle noted.

Lake said the enthusiasm is palpable.

“We’re taking our bus tour to voting centers. And, you know, we have to stay 75 feet back, but we take the bus tour there, and it is almost like — I don’t want to say party atmosphere, but people see the bus and they come after they vote, they come running over, and they’re celebrating the fact that they just voted. They recognize the historic nature of this election, and they’re so excited to say, we just voted for you. We voted for President Trump. And there’s a feeling of elation, like we are going to turn this around. We’re going to take our country back and make it — and bring our best days out ahead of us,” she said, emphasizing these “huge numbers.”

She said even in places like deep blue areas of Tucson, many Democrats have come to her saying they are voting for Trump because, “‘We can’t take this anymore. I’m working two jobs. I can’t take the wide open border. The crime is out of control. The businesses are boarded up.’ I mean, the people who are Democrats are coming over in droves. I believe we’re going to see a big number of Democrats in Arizona vote for Trump and vote for Kari Lake because they recognize the Democrat Party is not the old Democrat party,” she said.

LISTEN:

“I mean, when you go to Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy Jr., abandoning the Democrat Party, stepping over into the America First Republican movement, that says a lot, and we’re seeing evidence of that on the ground here in Arizona as well,” Lake said, while warning Republicans that they cannot get comfortable.

“But we cannot take our foot off the pedal. We’ve got to keep it going,” the Senate hopeful added.

Democrat Senate candidate Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) is “100 percent” in line with Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday just over a week out from election day.

“He’s literally voted for all of the problems that we have right now. He’s voted to make the problems and make them worse,” she said, explaining that this is about protecting the border, making streets safe again, restoring the economy, and bringing back peace and prosperity — “not war and poverty.”

“And that’s everything that’s on the line. It could not be more of a stark difference between what we’re getting on the ballot, whether it be at the top of the ballot between Kamala Harris and President Trump, or in this Senate race between Ruben Gallego or me, Kari Lake,” she said. “He’s voted 100 percent of the time in line with Kamala Harris. He’s voted for open borders. He’s voted to put federal dollars into sanctuary cities. He co-sponsored the legislation you might remember in the summer of 2020, the George Floyd legislation. He co-sponsored that. He wanted to get rid of the filibuster to push that through, and it would have defunded the police nationwide and gotten rid of qualified immunity for our officers. It would have made all of our streets more dangerous. And he was also for, you know, children being able to get sex change operations behind their parents’ back.”

“This is crazy stuff,” she said, explaining that people are “finally learning about my opponent.”

“He spent $100 million lying, doing an extreme makeover. He’s not telling people in his ads that he is the most radical Democrat in all of Congress. Nobody really knew who he was, so he’s been trying to reinvent himself and act like a moderate,” she said, noting “he’s lied about his backstory, just as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have lied about a lot of the particulars” of their backstories.

She went on to provide some very specific examples.

“He didn’t tell the people of this state that his father is a convicted felon drug trafficker with ties to the cartel. That’s a pretty big thing to keep out of your story, especially when you’re living in a border state and you voted to empower the cartels, not confront them; you voted to give the power more to the cartels, to traffic drugs, traffic children, smuggle human beings across our border,” she said, explaining that he also “tried to keep his divorce records hidden.”

“And we found out that he served his wife divorce papers a few days before Christmas and told the judge she’s days away from giving birth, and left her there to deliver their firstborn alone while he ran off with a D.C. lobbyist, and then they got married, the D.C. lobbyist, and ever since then, he’s been pushing all of her legislation,” she said, noting there are 38 pieces that she was pushing that he has “shepherded through Congress.”

“His priority is his wife’s lobbying firm, not the people of Arizona. He’s got a past of defrauding Latino immigrants out of their life savings, and he says he cares about Latino immigrants? He says he cares about women, he treats women that way? You know, when people are waking up to the fact that he’s lied about everything, and as they learn more about Ruben Gallego, they are realizing they cannot vote for him,” she said, reminding listeners that he also voted to impeach former President Donald Trump twice.

“These people are — they’re relentless, and they won’t stop in their hatred toward President Trump. But he goes beyond that. He called Trump voters the worst people in the world. He called us dumb, and now he wants to represent us. How does he represent a group of people — more than half of our state — if he hates us? And he calls this, the border wall, ‘the dumb, stupid border wall.’ And now he’s trying to act like, well, maybe we need the border wall. It is a reinvention,” she said.

LISTEN:

“They’re reinventing themselves just for the election season, and we know the second they would get in office, they would turn right back to heading us down this road. I don’t even say to socialism. I say to communism, because I really think that’s what their end goal is, to take away our Constitution and to destroy this republic,” Lake added.

I almost hate to do it again, since I have already written twice previously about Camila Thorndike, the recently hired “climate engagement director” for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. But Thorndike is turning out to be a bountiful provider of quotes that clearly illustrate the kind of alarmist radicals who would be guiding climate and energy policy in a Harris-Walz administration.

The first strong clue about Thorndike’s proud politically left leanings can be found on her LinkedIn page, where she invited followers to join her in an online event called “Progressive Mobilization for the Planet,” which was hosted Tuesday by radical Democratic Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Ro Khanna of California. (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: The Hard Life Of Being A Harris Climate Engagement Director)

The literature for the event reads, in part: “We will be hearing from leaders including U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, about the stakes of this election for the planet – and why Vice President Harris is the only choice. We’ll also be joined by Mark Ruffalo and Sophia Li who will rally us for the final stretch.”

Wow, Khana, Jayapal and Mark Ruffalo, all rolled into one. It almost gives you a Chris Matthews-like tingle down your leg, doesn’t it?

Khanna, of course, served as co-chair for Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ unsuccessful 2020 presidential run. So, he and Thorndike are probably well acquainted, given that Thorndike worked as Sanders’ energy and environment legislative assistant from May 2021 through August 2022. As if that wasn’t a good enough way to burnish her progressive climate credentials, Thorndike left Sanders’ office in September 2022 to serve in several roles for Rewiring America, a left-wing advocacy group that pushes to electrify everything and eliminate oil and gas.

Those past experiences set Thorndike up as the perfect “climate engagement director” for the final weeks of the Harris-Walz effort.

Thorndike’s X feed is a treasure trove of anti-fossil fuel views. In one X post from October 2021, she wrote, “It’s week one as Director of Policy Programs for Rewiring America. This team, this mission — lucky me!! Onwards with the clean energy revolution. Down with the fossil dictators and oligarchs. Let’s electrify everything.” Mind you, her reference there to “fossil dictators and oligarchs” is targeting executives at America’s oil, gas and coal companies, not Vladimir Putin, Iranian Mullahs, or the leaders of the House of Saud.

Thorndike’s feed is filled with re-tweets of posts from an array of anti-fossil fuel luminaries, and she seems especially fond of old radical Bill McKibben. She re-tweeted one McKibben post from Oct. 11 that reads: “Now that the world’s richest man has fully thrown in with America’s most dishonest politician, it’s clear this election is about one thing only: can our imperfect democracy stand up to this wave of money and lies?”

For the record, The Washington Post reported Monday that “Harris has a huge cash advantage over Trump,” and the “Harris campaign and its allied committees raised more than $1 billion in the third quarter.” Much of that money was raised from billionaires and not a few of the “fossil fuel dictators and oligarchs” referenced by Thorndike herself, many of whom are in fact Democrats.

Oh.

But it gets even more extreme. In May 2022, Thorndike tweeted her belief that “the fossil fuel industry’s ecoterrorism is … great birth control” that causes children to “die young.” In December 2021, she said the fossil fuel industry is “a death cult” which “quietly murders every day.”

Oh.

Everyone has an absolute right to hold strong opinions on key issues impacting our society, and energy and climate policy is no exception. But this kind of extreme demonization of the other side on any issue is beyond the pale, even though it does unarguably place Thorndike right in the mainstream of current Harris-Walz messaging. After all, the campaign’s closing argument appears to consist of various iterations of the former President “Donald Trump is Hitler” nonsense.

Because Vice President Harris has remained so steadfastly obtuse regarding her real positions on energy policy, voters are left to form their own judgments about how things might go. One way to do that is to look at the nature of the people who will be formulating those policies. (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: Which Kamala Harris Should Voters Believe?)

So, we should thank Thorndike for all the clarifying comments.

Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of inaction as Christian Armenians faced ethnic cleansing at the hands of Muslim Azerbaijanis last year — inaction that was spurred by a network of Azerbaijani foreign agents with ties to the Democratic Party.

On Sept. 19, 2023, Azerbaijan invaded the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited primarily by Armenian Christians, beginning a swift offensive effort that led to almost all 120,000 inhabitants of the territory fleeing westward for fear of death. Shortly after the Azerbaijani military launched its assault, foreign agents paid by various arms of Azerbaijan’s government began blasting out thousands of emails to lawmakers and key players in the Biden-Harris administration attempting to squash domestic backlash to the attack on Armenian Christians, according to Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) records.

While Azerbaijan currently retains six U.S. firms to do its bidding, BGR Government Affairs and the Friedlander Consulting Group did the heavy lifting running cover for the Caucasian oil state following its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh, FARA filings show. In the months following the offensive, BGR sent hundreds of emails, arranged meetings and made phone calls advocating for Azerbaijani interests. Friedlander Consulting, meanwhile, sent thousands of emails and organized meetings between key policymakers and members of the Azerbaijani government in the wake of the attack.

Both Mark Tavlarides, the primary BGR lobbyist working for Azerbaijan, and Ezra Friedlander, the head of Friedlander Consulting, have considerable ties to the Democratic Party. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)

Tavlarides served in the Clinton administration first as a legislative staffer in the Department of Defense and later as director of the White House National Security Council, according to his LinkedIn page. He has also donated nearly $30,000 to primarily Democratic political committees this election cycle, disclosure forms show.

Friedlander, meanwhile, has a history of working in Democratic politics in New York City, according to his company biography, and often reposts pro-Democratic messaging on his X account. Friedlander emphasized that his firm is “fully bipartisan and has reached out and worked with the entire spectrum of ideological and geographical political establishment to a fault.”

“These men, women and children, terrified for their lives, left behind entire worlds: their schools and shops; their fields, flocks, and vineyards; the cemeteries of their ancestors,” Harvard University professor Christina Maranci wrote of the exodus of Armenians spurred by the Azerbaijani offensive. “The United States and the European Union speak loftily of universal human rights, but did nothing for nine months while the people of [Nagorno-Karabakh] were denied food, medicine, fuel, and other vital supplies.”

Friedlander, whose firm receives $41,666 per month to represent the Azerbaijani government, started his public relations campaign for the country just days after it began to push ethnic Armenians out of their homes — setting up a meeting between House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer of Alabama with the Azerbaijani ambassador on Sept. 27, 2023, to discuss “developments in the South Caucasus,” disclosures show. The following day, Friedlander began working to arrange meetings between Azerbaijani embassy staff and various congressional offices, including, among others, those of Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Democratic Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Vance, in an October 2023 congressional memo, raised concerns over the “the rapid overthrow of the ceasefire agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan and the exodus of an ancient Christian community.”

Friedlander’s actions were preceded by Democratic New Jersey then-Sen. Robert Menendez introducing a Senate resolution on September 21, 2023, requesting humanitarian assistance for displaced Armenians, calling for the United States to sanction the Azerbaijani officials who orchestrated the attack and laying out actions to deepen America’s strategic ties with Armenia. The Azerbaijani foreign agent acted quickly, emailing virtually every Senate office eight days later urging them to oppose the resolution eight days after it was introduced, disclosures show.

It is unclear what Friedlander sent to these senators, however, as there are no emails included in his firm’s FARA disclosures that mention the Senate resolutions or that match the date of those communications. Regardless, the resolution never made it out of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, according to legislative records.

The resolution, which was co-sponsored by a bi-partisan coalition of senators, pointed out how Azerbaijan had indiscriminately used rockets and cluster bombs against civilian targets and maintained a blockade that stopped roughly 90% of food from entering Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to killing Armenian civilians, the invading Azerbaijani forces also destroyed Armenian churches and desecrated cultural heritage sites.

“The notion of Christians being persecuted in the Karabakh region or any other region in Azerbaijan is false,” Friedlander told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Even the Prime Minister of Armenia publicly stated that literally days after the mass exodus last September. The guilty party was the illegal separatists who encouraged the Armenian population to leave. The world has forgotten that it was the Armenians who illegally occupied Karabakh although it is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan and in fact hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis that were forcefully expelled from Armenia and from Karabakh are still listed as international displaced persons by the UN, which issued four resolutions calling on Armenia to leave Karabakh.”

In one communication to policymakers, Friedlander stressed that Christians in Azerbaijan are allowed to celebrate Christmas in Azerbaijan. Freedom House, however, gave Azerbaijan a religious freedom score of zero in 2023, pointing out that faith groups must register with the government and are subject to surveillance. Members of religious communities that attempt to operate without government approval have been subject to torture and imprisonment.

Tavlarides, the Azerbaijani foreign agent working for BGR, began his work for the country in November 2023, reaching the staff managers of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees to discuss the Armenian Protection Act of 2023, legislation that would bar Azerbaijan from receiving U.S. security aid for the next two years, disclosures show. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent shortly after but has since stalled in the House amid an aggressive lobbying campaign from Friedlander.

“This bill actively harms the normalization process between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” a mass email Friedlander sent to hundreds of House offices in February reads. Friedlander went on to deny that Azerbaijan engaged in ethnic cleansing and to remind lawmakers of Azerbaijan’s close relationship with Israel.

Tavlarides is a donor to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Friedlander is a practicing Jew who frequently posts about his support for Israel. Israel and Azerbaijan have a strong strategic relationship, with the latter providing the former with oil in exchange for guns.

In addition to attempting to influence lawmakers on behalf of the Azerbaijani government, Friedlander and Tavlarides also worked to influence the Biden administration’s response to the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, according to disclosures. The latter sent Assistant Secretary of Defense Rheanne Wrikkala an email in February expressing opposition to Senate Resolution 540, which would have requested that the Secretary of State provide a report investigating if Azerbaijan has engaged in human rights abuses and assessing if security assistance to the Caucasian nation should continue.

Tavlarides’ letter stressed Azerbaijan’s support of Ukraine and Israel, the country’s history of cooperation with the United States and the importance of America maintaining commitment to its allies, without mentioning the humanitarian abuses in Nagorno-Karabakh, disclosures show. He sent similar communications to a number of House offices. Tavlarides also reached the State Department on behalf of the Azerbaijani government in January, asking it to oppose amendments to the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that would restrict military assistance to the country, probe its relationships with Iran and Russia and call on it to release all prisoners of war and captured civilians.

Tavlarides also attempted to arrange a meeting between the Helsinki Commission, a U.S. agency that handles some European diplomatic affairs, and the Embassy of Azerbaijan, records show.

Friedlander, meanwhile, contacted the State Department in early 2024 and the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2023 to provide them with information about Azerbaijani cultural events, according to disclosures.

Tavlarides and Friedlander often extended offers to connect government officials with Azerbaijani diplomats at the end of their emails. Tavlarides did not respond to a request for comment.

Even as Azerbaijan escaped sanction for its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh thus far, it has continued to expand its influence network in D.C., FARA filings show.

As the House considers legislation to strip Azerbaijan of American military aid, the country’s embassy hired Skyline Capitol to represent it in June, agreeing to pay the firm $50,000 per month for its services. Skyline Capitol is led by the recently-retired Republican former Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, who sat on the House Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Committees. Stewart’s firm specializes in defense and foreign affairs lobbying.

After leaving Congress, lobbyists tend to leverage the connections they made while on the hill to deliver better representation to their clients which, in this case, happens to be a nation experts have accused of ethnic cleansing.

“Foreign governments don’t deserve a veto over U.S. human rights policy — a core American value,” Armenian National Committee of America executive director Aram Hamparian told the DCNF. “Azerbaijan, in particular, should not be allowed to enforce a gag-rule against American condemnation of its ethnic cleansing of at-risk Armenian Christians.”

Azerbaijan is allegedly asking lobbyists not to represent it without registering under FARA, which would mean that the American public would not be privy to what agents of the foreign nation were saying to officials, Politico reported Thursday night. Two lobbyists, speaking anonymously, said they had declined to work with the country because they believed it was prompting them to violate federal law.

A representative from the Azerbaijani Embassy stressed that the country’s “work with the companies is within the respective U.S. legislation.” They also accused Armenia of ethnic cleansing and argued that Azerbaijan has a tradition of multiculturalism and religious tolerance.

The Department of Defense, White House and BGR did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.

Democrat-aligned groups have been boosting voter turnout efforts through “downright dystopian” means such as free rent checks, gift cards, birth control, and “pole dancer” parties, sparking concerns over their efforts to attract young voters while raising questions about fairness as the DOJ focuses on Elon Musk’s America PAC over its recent sweepstakes.

As the 2024 election approaches, Democrat-affiliated groups continue deploying highly unconventional methods to boost voter turnout, particularly among younger voters in key swing states.

From monetary incentives to street fests, these get-out-the-vote (GOTV) tactics are funded by shadowy networks of left-wing donors and nonprofits, in efforts pushing the boundaries of legal and ethical voter engagement and bordering on outright bribes.

In Philadelphia, for example, the nonprofit The Voter Project hosted a series of events offering $2,000 rent checks and free Target shopping sprees to participants who check their voter registration. The group has also distributed comic books and backpacks, targeting young voters in Democrat-heavy neighborhoods.

The tax-deductible nonprofit has even organized $10,000 grants to community groups as part of its effort to bolster early voting.

“We are registering tens of thousands of voters, signing up tens of thousands to vote by mail, and we are maximizing early vote,” boasted Kevin Mack, the group’s far-left strategist.

Last week, the Washington Post reported that “Democratic groups have started paying at least $160 to more than 75,000 voters who agree to contact dozens of their friends and relatives with requests to support Kamala Harris.”

According to the report, the initiatives are run by a “vast, shadow” network of partisan groups operating under nonpartisan banners. Largely funded without public disclosure, these local and national networks have quietly prepared for years to mobilize unlikely voters in key states.

These efforts, which have included events distributing free items like tampons, birth control, and even beer, extend beyond giveaways.

The outreach strategies include large-scale cultural events designed to make voting feel more like a festival than a civic duty. Daybreaker, a dance party series, has hosted raves near voting centers with free food, live music, and in some cases, both “poll dancers” and “pole dancers” to draw in disengaged voters. These tactics are seen as ways to appeal to voters who might otherwise skip the polls.

Similarly, ShowUpStrong24 has hosted block parties and community events with music, local food, and entertainment, aiming to make voting a social activity.

In Phoenix, a group called Vote for Abortion drove through the city distributing free emergency contraceptives and feminine hygiene products to promote a midday concert featuring Lauren Jauregui, along with DJs, local influencers, and actress Busy Philipps.

Critics, including both conservative and some progressive outlets, question the ethics of such aggressive GOTV strategies.

The left-leaning New Republic called the tactics “downright dystopian,” accusing Democrats of offering cash and perks instead of making meaningful policy reforms to attract voters.

“Democrats are so desperate to reunite with young voters that they’ve resorted to paying them,” the left-wing outlet states, noting that Vice President Kamala Harris faces dwindling support from young voters. “Somehow, throwing money at the problem seems easier than making substantial policy changes.”

In response to such efforts, Chris LaCivita, a top Trump adviser, stated in June that “the only way a weak, failed, and corrupt leader’s allies can entice a populace to continue four more years of disastrous policies is to get them liquored up,” adding that Democrat “liberal financiers” will abandon young, black, and Hispanic voters after the election, “throwing block parties” now but later “ignoring their interests as they always have.”

The efforts, though, seem effective, with groups like The Voter Project claiming their initiatives will drive up youth turnout by over 100,000 in Pennsylvania alone.

Reports indicate that Democratic donors and strategists have dramatically escalated their GOTV efforts in 2024, funneling hundreds of millions into mobilization campaigns in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Much of this funding flows through local nonprofits and networks that operate independently of official Democratic campaigns, allowing them to reach specific voter segments while skirting public disclosure requirements.

However, despite their scale and visibility, these groups have faced little federal scrutiny. Operating under nonpartisan tax exemptions, many avoid disclosing their donors or budgets, blurring the line between legitimate outreach and ethically dubious voter incentives.

The DOJ and Musk’s America PAC

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently issued a warning to billionaire Elon Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC over its own voter sweepstakes, which promises registered voters in swing states a chance to win up to $1 million.

The DOJ cautioned that Musk’s sweepstakes could violate federal voting laws, despite lawyers arguing that the PAC does not directly pay people to vote or register. The DOJ’s actions have raised eyebrows, especially given the lack of similar scrutiny on the extravagant and high-spending GOTV efforts from left-wing groups.

Senator Tom Cotton was quick to call out the hypocrisy, questioning why the DOJ was targeting Musk while turning a blind eye to Democrats’ ongoing GOTV initiatives.

“Left-wing organizations often promote voter-registration sweepstakes,” he wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, questioning why the Justice Department is “singling out” Musk for something Democrats have been doing for years.

Cotton’s criticism, including accusations that the Biden-Harris administration is engaging in “political retribution,” echoes a broader frustration from conservatives, who argue that while Musk’s PAC faces scrutiny, Democratic groups are allowed to continue their lavish GOTV efforts unchecked.

Some on the right have also pointed to figures like LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, who has funded multiple groups using giveaways and social events to increase turnout among Democratic-leaning voters.

While Musk’s America PAC is limited to a single sweepstakes, Democratic-aligned initiatives have crafted expansive voter turnout infrastructures, using everything from cash incentives to celebrity appearances and door-knocking campaigns to reach disengaged youth.

As the DOJ closely scrutinizes Musk’s efforts while taking a largely hands-off approach to Democratic-backed campaigns, concerns mount over fairness in federal election oversight.
It is time that chief executive officers stand up and speak out about policy issues that impact their bottom line. Most CEOs seem to be supporting Vice President Kamala Harris because that is the safe way to go. A Yahoo Finance analysis of federal campaign filings through early June found that CEOs of 98 of the nation’s 100 largest companies had yet to financially support either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

The choices at that time seemed perfectly clear. It was between an incumbent who delivered a smothering regulatory state with exploding inflation and one who – prior to the historic pandemic – presided over a nation with low inflation, low unemployment and a growing economy driven by the 2017 Trump tax cuts and a more favorable regulatory agenda. (RELATED: DENNIS E. NIXON: The Border Is Going To Be Worse Under Kamala Harris)

By September, after the party conventions, 88 current and former business leaders came off the sidelines and endorsed Harris, a candidate even farther to the left and with less experience than Biden and with no apparent foreign policy experience to manage a world on fire. According to their statement of support, “With Kamala Harris in the White House, the business community can be confident that it will have a president who wants American industries to thrive.”

This month, American businessman Mark Cuban, former American Express Chairman and CEO Ken Chenault and other current and former corporate chiefs launched Business Leaders for Harris. “Her economic agenda is pro-growth, committed to supporting small and medium-sized business and reducing red tape and other barriers to innovation,” their website states. This statement simply cannot be validated by examining the Harris platform.

You have to wonder what alternate universe these business leaders inhabit. This is the same Kamala Harris who accused businesses of gouging consumers and has endorsed price controls as the solution to the high-inflationary forces that the Biden-Harris administration created because of excessive government spending. To make matters worse, Harris announced support for trillions of dollars in new taxes. Far from being pro-growth, price controls – coupled with excessive taxation – perversely skew markets, harming businesses and exacerbating supply shortages.

There’s nothing pro-growth about these policies.

At the national level, we’ve been down this path before. President Richard Nixon’s freeze on prices and wages in 1971 provided some temporary inflation relief, but at the cost of a decade of slow growth and a resumption of high inflation. They’re a top-down, socialist policy prescription that has consistently failed.

Another destructive policy Harris has endorsed is taxing unrealized gains, requiring some taxpayers to pay capital gains each year whether or not an asset has been sold. The consequences of such a policy are entirely predictable and will lead to capital flight from the United States to more tax-friendly countries and draining America of its innovators.

To understand the global implications of this policy, we only need to look at the tax- and regulatory-driven migration of people, businesses and capital from states like California, New York and Illinois to Texas, Florida and North Carolina.

But it’s not just major policy initiatives like price controls and taxation that strangle businesses and kill the economy. It’s also the destructive growth of regulations that increase costs for everything from food to furnaces. Research by the American Action Forum found that Biden administration regulations have added nearly $1.4 trillion in costs to American businesses. By comparison, Trump era regulations had an impact of approximately $30 billion.

Some business leaders may favor Harris’ positions on social issues, but no business leader can say with a straight face that she is pro-growth and a champion of American business. There is an irony in venture socialist CEOs, whose multinational corporations can afford the compliance costs of the Biden-Harris regulatory state and may actually benefit from the elimination of competition, pretending to advance the interests of small- and medium-sized businesses that will continue to wither under a Harris administration consolidating more economic and political power in the hands of the privileged.

Elections are about choices, and the 2024 presidential election is no different. Clearly, there are many business leaders who have shown support for Kamala Harris. But I doubt any of them would hire her to lead their company.

Stores across America are shutting down left and right as shoppers are unable to afford to spend money on non-essentials.

CNN Business reported on Friday that so far in 2024, major retailers have said they are closing down 6,189 stores. That number surpasses the 2023 total of 5,553, per Coresight Research, the article said.

“Chains are on track to close the highest number of stores in 2024 than any year since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic decimated the industry.”

The outlet continued:

Closures have picked up this year because the retail sector’s sugar high of 2021 and 2022 — when consumers were snapping up new couches, televisions and clothing — has ended. Companies have raised prices higher than many consumers can afford and interest rates have soared, making it more expensive to borrow money for big-ticket items or to get a mortgage or a car loan. Consumers have reached their breaking point and are pulling back on items they don’t absolutely need.

In addition, smaller chains are struggling to keep up with businesses such as Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Home Depot that present shoppers with lower prices, per Fox 8. The outlet also noted that even so, Big Lots is planning to close over 350 stores.

“Additionally, years of overexpanding and failed strategies are coming back to bite some chains. Retailers big and small have expanded much more than they probably should have,” the article said.

In September, Breitbart News reported that middle-class Americans suffering under inflation in President Joe Biden’s (D) economy had become too poor to shop at dollar stores.

Breitbart News’s John Carney explained:

The Biden-Harris administration, with its reckless fiscal expansions and ideological hubris, has forced consumers into a corner. It was inevitable that even the affluent would feel the blow; and now, with Dollar Tree’s stock plunging nearly 25 percent, the axe has finally bitten into the grain.

More recently, retail expert and former Target Vice Chairman Gerald Storch said, “It’s very clear that consumers are running out of money.”

“They’re increasingly stressed by inflation and the exhaustion of their pandemic-era savings. When you take a look over the last several years, what you see month after month, everyone talks about, the consumer’s still spending,” he said. “They might be, but they’re spending less than the growth of inflation.”

Former President Donald Trump (R), who is campaigning against Vice President Kamala Harris (D) for the presidency in the November election, is enjoying a large polling lead over her regarding the economy and inflation, Breitbart News reported on Friday.
Top podcaster Joe Rogan explained Friday during a three-hour unscripted interview with former President Donald Trump how the 2024 Republican nominee’s unique path to the White House in 2016 involved saying “a lot of wild shit.”

Trump commented he always attracted more publicity than others without trying, prompting the host of “The Joe Rogan Experience” to reflect how establishment media contributed to Trump’s surge in popularity and ascension to the presidency.

“Oh, I can definitely tell you. You said a lot of wild shit,” Rogan laughed. “You said a lot of wild shit, and then CNN, in all their brilliance, by highlighting your wild shit, made you much more popular.”

Rogan also told Trump how voters exhausted by carefully scripted political rhetoric were drawn to the then-Repiblican candidate’s perceived authenticity.

Wow 😂 TRUMP: “I always got more publicity than other people…I don’t know exactly why?” ROGAN: “You said a lot of wild shit!” pic.twitter.com/ybf0zYSIh8 — Russell Brand (@rustyrockets) October 26, 2024

“People were tired of someone talking in this bullshit, pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn’t agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that’s him,” Rogan said.

Rogan then pointed to Trump’s large rallies and compared his delivery to that of a standup comedian — for which he said no politician was comparable.

“You need at least the attitude of a comedian when you’re doing this business. This is a very dangerous business, first of all. It’s a very tough business,” Trump said.

Rogan also ripped the media for brushing the two assassination attempts on Trump’s life out of the news. The GOP nominee, however, said he would “rather not talk about” the incidents. (RELATED: Biden Will Not Appear With Kamala Harris Before Election Day: REPORT)

Trump also admitted to the major podcaster how his biggest mistake as president was appointing people he later reflected should not have been selected for certain positions in his administration.

“The biggest mistake I’ve made is I’ve picked some people — I’ve picked some great people, but you don’t think about that — I picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked,” Trump said, specifically naming his former chief of staff, John Kelly.

Vice President Kamala Harris was asked the same question during a Wednesday town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper. The 2024 Democratic presidential nominee said she made many mistakes, initially comparing herself to a parent.

Harris eventually settled on highlighting a strength instead of a weakness, only to say it would be a weakness to lack the said strength.

“In my role as vice president, I mean, I probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well-versed on issues and I think that is very important. It’s a mistake not to be well-versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question,” Harris said with a smirk at the CNN host.

Harris backed out of an interview with Rogan on Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.

Rogan previously revealed he had concerns how interviewing Trump could “help him.”

“By the way, I am not a Trump supporter, in any way, shape or form,” Rogan said during a July 2022 appearance on the “Lex Fridman Podcast.” “I have had the opportunity to have him on my show, more than once, and I have said no every time. I don’t want to help him, I’m not interested in helping him.”

After the former president survived an assassination attempt at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, however, Rogan reconsidered his position.

“Once they shot you, I was like, ‘He’s got to come in here,'” Rogan said. “It’s all about timing.”

Trump opened the long-anticipated interview with Rogan — which garnered over seven million views overnight after being uploaded Friday night — by revealing how winning the presidency was more “surreal” than his being shot in the ear.

“When I was in and won and was in the White House, essentially, well, first of all, it was very surreal,” the former president said. “It’s very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn’t surreal. That should have been surreal.”
With less than two weeks until Election Day, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are working to score points with a critical voting bloc - young Americans.

While Trump has made strides with the voting group, Kamala Harris was called out by a Gen Z conservative influencer, who claims young women are tired of being "pandered" to by the campaign.

"I'm a young woman, and I'm being constantly pandered to on the campaign trail. About the only thing I'm allowed to care about, according to Kamala Harris, is a woman's supposed constitutional right to an abortion," influencer Isabel Brown said on "The Faulkner Focus."

HARRIS CAMPAIGN FACES WARNING SIGNS WITH YOUNG VOTERS IN ARIZONA: REPORT

Brown added there is a "clear disconnect with where the culture of America is today, not just economic issues, but I think we're looking for someone who can truly bring a new generation of leadership to Washington, new ideas, a fresh perspective. And that's not happening with the Kamala Harris regime."

The sitting vice president has benefited from major celebrity endorsements and rode post-Democratic National Convention hype through the past weeks of campaigning. In the final stages of the 2024 race, she has shifted her strategy to focus on a media blitz while still struggling to address tough questions on her tenure in office and policy plans.

"I think Kamala Harris is still coasting on vibes and coconut memes when all we want to hear is how is she going to make life more affordable for everyday Americans. The forgotten men and women in this country who feel left behind by the political elites," content creator Link Lauren told host Harris Faulkner.

"Shockingly, Usher, Lizzo, Eminem, they don't really seem to be selling the Democratic Party," Brown added.

‘KAMALA ERA’: DNC LAUNCHES TAYLOR SWIFT-THEMED CAMPAIGN IN PITCH TO YOUNG VOTERS

The panel of young voters pointed to other issues like the economy and the southern border as top-of-mind concerns heading into Election Day.

"I'm reminded of why I should vote for President Trump every single time I go to a grocery store. Every time I fill up a gas tank, I think this is something that is on the minds of every single voter, every single time they swipe their credit card under this administration," RNC youth advisory council co-chair CJ Pearson said.

"We need young people to vote because it's our future on the ballot. If we don't make our voices heard, who will speak for us?" - CJ Pearson

"I've got a lot to complain about these days. Whether it's runaway inflation, record high gas prices, or an economy where Americans can't even focus on how they can thrive because they're too busy focusing on how they can survive under the Kamala Harris, Joe Biden administration," he continued.

Cortland County, N.Y. legislator Reed Cleland pushed back during the panel, arguing the country "can't afford" another Trump presidency. He pointed to the former president's tax cuts and foreign policy decisions, claiming Harris has "laid out an agenda for working people."

"Presidential elections matter. State elections matter. Local elections matter. Local officials make decisions on a day-to-day basis that affect people's lives every single day. There are races up and down the ballot," Cleland concluded.

According to a recent NYT/Siena poll, 25% of young voters say the economy is the top issue facing the country. The second-biggest issue among the voting bloc is abortion at 19%. Other issues include inflation and the cost of living, immigration and the character and competence of the candidates.

"There are millions of young people who feel disenfranchised and disenchanted with the entire political process," Lauren argued.

"They feel like these adults we elected to lead by example, they're the ones who racked up $35 trillion of debt. They're the reason we have an immigration crisis, wars around the world, housing crisis, chronic disease crisis. But they're also millions of young people who I think are looking at Donald Trump for the first time and saying he looks like the change agent in this election. Kamala Harris very much looks like politics as usual."
Washington Post staffers are revolting after the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper announced it wouldn’t endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

On Friday, Post publisher and CEO William Lewis announced the paper would not be making a presidential endorsement this year, nor in any future presidential election. "We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates," Lewis declared.

Shortly after, the Washington Post Guild released a scathing statement condemning the decision.

"We are deeply concerned that The Washington Post – an American news institution in the nation’s capital – would make the decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election. The role of an Editorial Board is to do just this: to share opinions on the news impacting our society and culture and endorse candidates to help guide readers," the Guild said.

THE WASHINGTON POST ANNOUNCES IT WON'T BE ENDORSING IN 2024 RACE OR 'IN ANY FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION'

"The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis – not from the Editorial Board itself – makes us concerned that management interfered with the work out of members in Editorial," the Guild continued. "According to our own reporters and Guild members, an endorsement for Harris was already drafted, and the decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos."

The Guild added: "We are already seeing cancelations from once loyal readers. This decision undercuts the works of our members at a time when we should be building our readers’ trust, not losing it."

The Guild put up a post with a link encouraging action, saying, "Are you a Washington Post reader concerned with today’s decision for the Editorial Board to not endorse a candidate this election cycle? Send a letter to CEO and Publisher Will Lewis and Editorial Page Editor David Shipley."

Post editor at large Robert Kagan resigned because of the decision, and former executive editor Martin "Marty" Baron denounced it as "cowardice."

"This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. @realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others). Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage," Baron wrote on X.

Washington Post columnist and associate editor Karen Tumulty reposted Baron's message.

Post climate change reporter Brianna Sacks also retweeted Baron and wrote in reaction to the news of the decision, "We won a Pulitzer for public service for our coverage of the Jan. 6 insurrection."

A former high-level Washington Post employee also sided with Baron's sentiment, calling out the "feckless" decision.

"It very disingenuously draws false equivalencies," they told Fox News Digital. "This is not, for example, Kamala Harris vs. Mitt Romney. This is Kamala Harris against someone who tried to disenfranchise the electorate last time."

"And if you're going to decide that it's not the role of an editorial board to endorse, then don't endorse. Don't endorse for Senate. Don't endorse for House. Just don't endorse," they continued.

The ex-staffer has been hearing from distressed former colleagues, saying they are "shocked" and "deeply disappointed," and said current staffers think the explanation that was given is a "fig leaf."

"I'm hearing that they are being absolutely flooded with subscription cancelations," the source said.

They told Fox News Digital, "I have never been honestly ashamed of The Post until today. ‘The first mission of a newspaper is to tell the truth as nearly as the truth can be ascertained.’ That's from Eugene Meyer's Principles of The Post. Today's decision is an abject abdication of those principles."

LOS ANGELES TIMES WON'T ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2008: REPORT

The former Post employee warned of the "chilling effect" this could have on the newsroom as a result.

"You know this is an editorial issue. There really was a church/state divide. But I do know that there are people in editorial who have roots in the newsroom and so it stings," they said. "And I think people in the newsroom are thinking ‘if they killed an endorsement, can a news story be far behind.’ And Lewis has certainly expressed willingness to at least try that. If Trump wins, who in their right mind would want you to cover that administration for The Post, looking over your shoulder all the time to see if the publisher or owner is going to to be miffed. There's a chilling effect on the mission of the place that this move sends."

Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah took to X to scold her employer.

"Today has been an absolute stab in the back. What an insult to those of us who have literally put our careers and lives on the line, to call out threats to human rights and democracy," Attiah wrote.

In its own coverage of the news in the Style section, The Post reported, "The decision has roiled many on the editorial staff, which operates independently from The Post’s news staff, a long-standing tradition of American journalism designed to separate opinion writing from day-to-day news coverage."

Health care reporter Fenit Nirappil tweeted of the report, "Our news side continues to report fearlessly. Even when it’s about our own bosses."

He included images of two particular quotes:

"An endorsement of Harris had been drafted by Post editorial page staffers but had yet to be published, according to two sources briefed on the sequence of events who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — according to the same sources."

"This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty. Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners)," former Post executive editor Martin Baron, who led the paper while Trump was president, said in a text message to The Post. "History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage."

LA TIMES EDITOR RESIGNS OVER THE PAPER NOT ENDORSING HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT: 'NOT OKAY WITH US BEING SILENT'

A source close to Washington Post leadership claimed to Fox News Digital that Bezos was not involved in the decision. However, a separate source spoke with Fox News Digital and believes otherwise, citing The Post's own reporting claiming the billionaire directly intervened.

"A non-endorsement would have made sense if it had been announced before the nominees were known. But doing it 11 days before the election suggests Bezos is worried he’d lose government contracts if Trump wins. So it signals intimidation works," a current Post staffer told Fox News Digital. "Trump certainly caused trouble for Bezos in his presidency by killing a big cloud computing contract and messing with the Amazon postal contract. So he knows how expensive a second term might be if Trump were mad at our coverage."

The staffer also said Baron is "regarded as a hero" for his X post, adding "he framed the stakes just right."

As far the Post's current leader, Lewis, the source said he has "lost the newsroom."

"I wouldn’t trust a word Will Lewis or any of his people say," the staffer told Fox News Digital. "He lost the newsroom over the summer. He never shows his face anymore. We get weekly rah-rah emails. That’s it. He used to wander the newsroom but apparently knows he’s not welcome."

A Post spokesperson declined to comment further but reiterated it was a "Washington Post decision."

11 Post opinion columnists wrote a statement calling the decision a "terrible mistake."

"The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake. It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 275 years. This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020," they said.

"There is no contradiction between The Post’s important role as an independent newspaper and its practice of making political endorsements, both as a matter of guidance to readers and as a statement of core beliefs. That has never been more true than in the current campaign. An independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn’t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution."

It was signed by Perry Bacon Jr., E.J. Dionne Jr., Lee Hockstader, David Ignatius, Heather Long, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Catherine Rampell, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin and Karen Tumulty.

The Post published an image by editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes titled "Democracy Dies in Darkness" that was just what looked like black paint strokes.

Famed Post Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein issued a statement saying, "We respect the traditional independence of the editorial page, but this decision 12 days out from the 2024 presidential election ignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. Under Jeff Bezos’s ownership, the Washington Post’s news operation has used its abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger and damage a second Trump presidency could cause to the future of American democracy and that makes this decision even more surprising and disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process."

LA TIMES UNION BEGS READERS NOT TO CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT PAY THEIR SALARIES AFTER BLASTING OWNER

In the political world, former Biden adviser Susan Rice wrote multiple posts expressing her outrage.

"As a DC native and lifelong subscriber to the Post, I’m disgusted. You have lost us," she wrote, then added, "So much for ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’. This is the most hypocritical, chicken s[---] move from a publication that is supposed to hold people in power to account."

She responded to a report of a Washington Post editorial board member blasting the decision, saying, "So what are they going to do about it? The whole Post editorial department should walk out."

"This is what Oligarchy is about. Jeff Bezos, the 2nd wealthiest person in the world and the owner of the Washington Post, overrides his editorial board and refuses to endorse Kamala. Clearly, he is afraid of antagonizing Trump and losing Amazon’s federal contracts. Pathetic," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote.

Fox News Digital’s Scott Whitlock and Alexa Moutevelis contributed to this report.
President Biden took aim at former President Trump at a campaign event in Pennsylvania Saturday, using his remarks to cast his predecessor as an anti-labor leader who, if re-elected, would renege on some of the union's hardest-fought gains.

Speaking at an event in Pittsburgh, Biden repeatedly described Trump as a "loser" who doesn’t care about union workers and would gladly do away with benefits like health care and pension plans if he won the presidency a second time.

"Donald Trump is a loser," Biden told the audience. "He’s a loser of a candidate, and he’s a loser of a man.

"I’ve never been this direct," Biden added. "But I tell you what, [Trump] is about making sure you push people down. He thinks the way you get ahead is to push people down."

His remarks were tailored specifically to union workers in Philadelphia, a group that has until recently been a reliable bedrock of support for Democratic candidates. But labor politics have shifted in recent years, especially in Rust Belt states, to favor Trump, many workers citing his accessible rhetoric and appeal to working-class voters.

Some longtime unions have altogether declined to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, citing the split ideology among their members.

Many also remain lukewarm about Harris’ campaign, viewing her as doing little to win their vote in the months since entering the presidential race.

BIDEN STUMBLES THROUGH EVENT, REFERS TO FORMER REP. GIFFORDS IN PAST TENSE: 'NOTHING WRONG WITH ME'

Biden’s speech Saturday attempted to rectify that, even as most of his remarks were focused on criticizing the former president, whom he noted has tried "51 times" to eliminate health care coverage for union employees.

"The last thing we need is for Trump to get elected, to take away all the things we've done," he said. "How many of you have pensions now? How many of your families have pensions?" Biden asked.

Trump, he said, "opposes it."

He also made an indirect swipe at Tesla founder and Trump ally Elon Musk, criticizing an unnamed "illegal worker" who has used his funds and public persona to stump on behalf of the former president.

"Turns out the wealthiest man in the world, now [Trump’s] ally, was an illegal worker here," Biden told the audience, though he stopped short of mentioning Musk by name.

PHILLY'S FIREFIGHTERS UNION BACKS BOB CASEY'S RIVAL IN SENATE RACE

The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request from Fox News Digital for clarification about the president's remark.

Musk is one of Trump’s highest-profile supporters and has donated more than $118 million to a super PAC supporting his re-election.

The unsparing criticism in the speech was something new from Biden, now a lame-duck candidate in his final two months of the presidency.

And that knowledge may have invigorated the outgoing president, whose voice got louder and stronger as his speech continued.

"There is more to do, and Kamala is going to make it happen," Biden said, imploring the crowd once again to vote in the Nov. 5 election.

"I can think of no man who has thought less of the American worker," Biden said of Trump. He is a man with "no character," and who "doesn't give a d--- about union members."
Former President Donald Trump made his case to major podcaster Joe Rogan and his listeners why he is the superior 2024 presidential nominee Friday in a highly-anticipated episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience.”

As the two filmed their three-hour unscripted discussion in Austin, Trump spoke about launching the U.S. Space Force during his first term before he highlighted billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Starlink endeavors. Trump noted Musk proudly endorsed him and urged Rogan — who he said is “not a Kamala person” — to do the same.

“He gave me the nicest endorsement too. Tough. He said, ‘The country’s gonna fail.’ You should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala,” Trump said as Rogan broke out into laughter.

“Kamala! You’re not a Kamala person,” he told Rogan. “I know you. I’ve watched you! I know him better than he — you know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife.”

Trump claimed to Rogan he watched the podcaster for years before expounding on Musk’s Starlink, his own economic leadership and the tax cuts during his first term as president.

The GOP nominee was then pressed on Harris’s comparing him to Adolf Hitler, prompting Trump to blast his opponent and the Democratic Party for their escalatory rhetoric. He also suggested Harris should take a cognitive test. (RELATED: ‘You Said A Lot Of Wild Sh*t’: Joe Rogan Explains Trump’s Unique Path To The Presidency)

“Once they shot you, I was like, ‘He’s got to come in here. It’s all about timing,” Rogan remarked, sitting across from Trump 11 days before Election Day.

“The timing is good,” Trump responded.

“The timing is perfect,” the podcaster added.

Trump said Harris would be “laying on the floor comatose” if she did Rogan’s show, but the podcaster suggested the vice president may appear before Election Day.

“Could you imagine Kamala doing this show?” Trump asked.

“I could imagine her doing this show,” Rogan interjected, telling Trump he will continue to try to book Harris and would talk to her like a “human being.”

Trump: Can you imagine Kamala doing this show? Rogan: I could imagine her doing this show. Trump: She’d be laying on the floor. Rogan: She was supposed to do it. And she might still do it.

Harris backed out of an interview with Rogan on Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.

The Democratic nominee visited Texas on Friday, the same day as Trump. Harris held a rally with pop icon Beyoncé — who had previously been rumored to be appearing at the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago.

Following the interview with Rogan which garnered 11 million YouTube views in 13 hours, Trump spoke at a Friday night rally in Michigan. He blasted Harris for putting on a star-studded show at the same time Israel was launching a strike on Iran in retaliation for its Oct. 1 missile attack.

“The Middle East is like a tinderbox: it’s ready to explode, people being killed at levels that we’ve never seen before. And that’s taking place right now,” Trump said.

“Nobody is in charge; Joe Biden is asleep. Kamala is at a dance party with Beyoncé,” the Republican nominee stated as rally-goers erupted with boos.
During his closing monologue on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher called for 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris to admit the left went too far on crime, rioting, DEI, immigration, and education and to clearly push back on teachers’ unions.

Maher began by saying, “With only a couple of weeks to go, it’s not too late for Kamala Harris to do what many have been calling for her to do since she became the candidate, have a Sister Souljah moment.”

He added, “Kamala could make her own Rev. Wright speech and ask all white Americans to please understand, as much as you can, how much, in 2020, the sight of a black man being slowly murdered with a white cop’s knee on his neck would affect you, if that was the history of your race. I think most Americans would be sympathetic, and then admit that, in 2020, the left got a little carried away. Carried away, like most of the merch at this shoe store. … Looting was rebranded as justice shopping. We stopped arresting shoplifters. ‘Antiracist Baby’ was a bestseller. Corporations took DEI to ludicrous lengths. We opened our hearts to all who wanted to come here, and then also our borders. Portland decriminalized all drugs and Seattle set up a no-cop zone until they had to reverse course on both. Standardized testing was dropped until schools saw how dumb that was.”

Maher continued, “And yet, the head of the teachers’ union in Chicago still maintains that testing is ‘junk science rooted in white supremacy.‘ And her union tweeted during COVID, when many Americans felt we could have gotten back to normal sooner, that ‘the push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism[,] and misogyny.‘ No, it was rooted in reading, writing, and arithmetic. The teaching of which is apparently job none in Chicago, because only about one in four students in the city are proficient in either math or English, and absenteeism is off the charts. The teachers there want a raise now, and, look, I’m always all for all teachers always getting a raise everywhere — I hate kids, I can’t imagine being around them all day — but I also think Kamala Harris could have a moment if she trotted out her favorite phrase and said, let me be very clear: Our schools need to do better. Our kids need to be in school, and when they’re there, they need to have the phones off and the brains on, learning the basic things we used to teach. And the idea that testing is rooted in white supremacy is, in itself, a racist belief that says black children can’t compete with white children on tests, which they surely can.”

He concluded, “When Kamala says, we’re not going back, the undecided voter thinks, no, I don’t want to get on the short bus back to Trump town, but I also don’t want to go back to 2020. Please, God, don’t make me sit through another one of those corporate-mandated sensitivity training sessions. When the Harris campaign launched, they got great traction by calling Trump and Vance weird. That was good. Weird was working. People are tired of weird. And ever since Donald Trump decided to dominate our f*cking lives, the Democrats’ argument has been, we’ll restore normal. Well, if what you’re selling is, let’s be normal again, here’s an idea: be normal. America doesn’t need a revolution, it needs fixing.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters Saturday that he does not believe former President Trump is a fascist, while defending the Republican presidential nominee the day before a major rally at Madison Square Garden.

Adams and other city leaders held a press conference at the New Yew City Police Department headquarters on Saturday afternoon to discuss security measures before the campaign rally in Manhattan.

During the press conference, a reporter asked Adams if he believed Trump is a fascist, as others have said.

“I’ve heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like Hitler and fascist,” Adams said. “My answer is no. I know what Hitler has done and I know what a fascist regime looks like.”

He suggested everyone dial down the temperature, adding he strongly disagrees with those who say Trump should not be allowed to have a rally at Madison Square Garden.

“This is America. This is New York, and I think it’s important that we allow individuals to exercise their right to get their message clear to New Yorkers,” Adams said. “Our job as a city and as a police department is to make sure they can do that in a peaceful way.

“When people called me a fascist and other terminologies, I didn’t like it and I don’t think it’s fitting to anyone to state that the former president is equal to being Hitler,” he added.
Top Democrats are worried about Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances Nov. 5 while most polls have the presidential race locked in a dead heat, according to Axios.

Less than two weeks to go, top Democrats are already discussing who is to blame for a loss to former President Donald Trump: the vice president or President Joe Biden for failing to drop out of the race earlier, Axios reported based on conversations with officials inside her campaign and top Biden administration officials. Democrats expressed concern to Axios that in her shortened campaign the vice president hasn’t defined herself enough and has cast too many different arguments against Trump.

“She is who she is,” one longtime Democratic strategist told the outlet. “Let’s hope it’s enough.”

“Going down?” a top Democratic official sent in a text to Axios.

The Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the states that make up the “blue wall,” especially in Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)

As top Democrats worry the vice president hasn’t done a good job making the case for why she should be president, many were impressed with a line she used during a CNN town hall Wednesday, Axios reported.

“Just imagine the Oval Office in three months … It’s either Donald Trump in there stewing — stewing! — over his enemies list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list,” Harris said.

“Better late than never,” a top Democrat told Axios, with another adding, “it’s good. We’re not dead yet.”

During that same town hall, the vice president said she believed Trump was a fascist, citing comments his former chief of staff John Kelly made to The New York Times and the Atlantic. Earlier that day, Harris gave impromptu remarks on the articles in which Kelly claimed that Trump would rule like a fascist, said Hitler “did some good things” and wanted generals like the Nazi dictator.

The Trump campaign has denied both stories.

The Atlantic story also alleged that Trump disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. Former officials, the Trump campaign, the veteran’s family and their lawyer all went on the record to deny the story.

“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said about the stories. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.

“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued.

In the final weeks of the campaign, Harris’ message has shifted to criticizing Trump and the threat he poses to the nation. Biden’s campaign message was similar and centered around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president ended his bid for the White House, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the “threat to democracy” slogan, Axios reported.

Harris is poised to make her closing argument for new leadership Tuesday at the spot Trump spoke at before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to NBC News.
Several employees for the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post resigned after their papers’ respective editorial boards refrained from endorsing a presidential candidate.

LA Times’ billionaire owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, blocked the editorial board’s plan to endorse Kamala Harris, Semafor reported Tuesday.

Mariel Garza, the paper’s editorials editor, resigned the next day.

“I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent” Garza told the Columbia Journal Review (CJR). “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.”

Two more members of the editorial board followed. Veteran reporters Robert Greene and Karin Klein resigned Thursday, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

The trend continued Friday when The Washington Post publisher William Lewis declared the paper’s editorial board would not be endorsing a presidential candidate “in this election. Nor in any future presidential election.”

Lewis cited the paper’s responsibility to “provide through the newsroom nonpartisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds.”

The editorial board had reportedly drafted an endorsement for Kamala Harris before the paper’s owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, quashed it, Semafor reported.

Many people, particularly liberals, excoriated the decision, including WaPo’s former executive editor, Martin Baron.

“This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty,” Baron wrote on X.

At least one high-profile member of the editorial board, Robert Kagan (husband to former Biden administration Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland), resigned over the matter, according to NPR. He could be the first of many.

WaPo staff are reportedly “furious” over the decision, Semafor’s Max Tani reported. (RELATED: WaPo Reporters Run Hit Piece On Their Own Editor Before He Takes Top Job)

“Several are contemplating what action to take, ranging from resigning, quitting the board, or a statement. ‘If you don’t have the balls to own a newspaper, don’t,’ one Post opinion employee tells me,” Tani wrote on Twitter.

WaPo staff are “uniformly outraged,” according to NPR’s David Folkenflik.

One voice that’s been noticeably quiet is pseudo-conservative WaPo opinion writer Jen Rubin.

Rubin, who lauded Garza’s LA Times exit, asked “where are the rest of them?” in a Wednesday post.

Journalist Mark Halperin said Friday that mounting “data” suggests former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum against Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris currently trails Trump slightly in all seven top swing states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Halperin, on his 2WAY platform, noted a lack of confidence among Democrats as Harris’ likelihood of defeating Trump in November appears unlikely. (RELATED: Biden Campaigns On Trump Being A Threat To Democracy, But Voters May Not Be Buying It: POLL)

WATCH:

“Unfortunately for blue America, there’s an asymmetry in what’s going on now. We could spend all day, the three of us, trying to get a Democrat on the phone who was super confident, like, ‘We’re going to win.’ We wouldn’t succeed in terms of political professionals, members of Congress, strategists,” Halperin said.” It would take us one call, random dial any Republican in our rolodex, to find someone who said, ‘Yeah, I’m pretty confident we’re going to win.’ Or more.”

“Okay, that’s an asymmetry. It’s just a reality. Some attribute it to cultural differences between the party and there’s something to that,” he continued. “There’s qualitative and quantitative data everywhere you look that things have moved in Trump’s direction and that it will be difficult for her to win, but not impossible. And that is causing a lot of tension in blue America.”

Halperin then pointed to The New York Times/Siena College’s last national poll of the 2024 election cycle, which the outlet published on Friday and found Trump and Harris tied at 48%. The previous NYT/Siena poll published on Oct. 8 found Harris leading Trump 49% to 46% nationally.

“The conventional wisdom has been, even though it may be false, that if Donald Trump is tied or within a couple points in the national poll, he’s going to win. Now The New York Times says it’s possible that Kamala Harris could win the electoral college and lose the popular vote,” Halperin said. “And we’ve talked about Trump over-performing from last time in the big blue states that could make him a bigger popular vote winner, but still lose the electoral college. Possible.”

The poll also found Trump drawing 42% of Hispanic voters and 11% of black voters. Halperin read from an X post from CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein reacting to the poll, which states it “shows Harris basically matching [President Joe] Biden winning 2020” percentages among whites, but “slipping” among minorities, particularly Latinos.

The analyst asserted this data “explains why less diverse Rustbelt states remain the most plausible path for her, as they were for Biden.”

The journalist also read from an X post from pollster and former Bill Clinton adviser Mark Penn, which states, “[The Wall Street Journal] and Forbes polls all show 3 to 4 point movements in the direction of Trump in the last few weeks. This is real movement and momentum going into the close. It is still close but this is a substantial move.”

Halperin also asserted Tuesday that Trump will be elected president on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory “continues.”

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Friday that Republican nominee Donald Trump may possibly “make history” on Election Day by winning the popular vote.

Trump’s recent edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in national polling has indicated that he may be in a position to win the popular vote, Enten said. In such a scenario, the former president would become the first Republican nominee in 20 years to win the popular vote.

“Trump may win the popular vote,” Enten said. “Everyone has been talking about this idea that Trump may win in the Electoral College but Kamala Harris will win the popular vote. But Trump may finally get his great white whale. Harris versus Trump national margin, you mention that New York Times [is] a tie, that’s actually right in the middle of the spectrum when we’re talking about recent polling data. You don’t have to look very far to find Donald Trump ahead nationally. He was up by 2 points in the CNBC poll, up by 3 [points] in the Wall Street Journal poll, very close races within the margin of error.”

“But the bottom line is, with the popular vote, which we really haven’t focused upon, a very, very tight race, John. Fact is Donald Trump is very much in a position [where] he could win the popular, which of course this is something he would absolutely love to do,” Enten continued.

Harris is leading Trump by an average of 1 point in national popular vote polls as of Friday, standing much lower than President Joe Biden’s 9-point lead or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 6-point lead in late October before the elections of 2016 and 2020. The vice president’s narrow lead in national polling indicates that the popular vote is “way too close to call,” Enten said. (RELATED: MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki Says Kamala Harris’ Popularity Has Tumbled Off A Cliff In Blink Of An Eye)

“Harris in the average poll right now is up by 1, well within the margin of error. You go back four years ago, Joe Biden was well ahead of Donald Trump in the national popular vote polls. He was up by 9. Even Hillary Clinton was up by 6 points, so now Donald Trump’s in a position he really hasn’t been before at this point in the campaign where he could truly compete and can truly say at this point that the popular vote is way too close to call,” Enten said.

A Republican presidential nominee has not won the popular vote since former President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004. Bush was the first Republican candidate to win the popular vote in a presidential election since his father, George H.W. Bush, was elected in 1988.

“The fact that the polls are so close, the fact that Donald Trump has a legitimate shot of winning the popular vote is something I think a lot of folks, including in my line of work, really didn’t think could possibly happen when Donald Trump was running last time around. He could make history, not just for Donald Trump, but for a Republican candidate as well,” Enten continued.

The former president is faring well in California, New York, Florida and Texas, which is boosting his chances of winning the popular vote, though those states will not determine a victory in the Electoral College, Enten said.

Trump took the lead nationally over Harris with 47% to 45% in a Wall Street Journal poll published Thursday, while a new CNBC poll found the former president securing a 2-point lead nationally. The former president also held a 0.8 point lead against Harris across every swing state as of Friday, according to RealClearPolling averages.

In a national poll from NY Times/Sienna released Friday, Donald Trump has surged to a one-point lead over Kamala Harris, 47 to 46 percent.

A little over two weeks ago, this same pollster showed the former president losing to Harris by three points, 44 to 47 percent.

That represents a four-point swing in one of the most trusted polls out there.

That particular result is when third-party candidates are included in the survey.

In a head-to-head race with no third-party candidates, this same poll shows the national race tied, 48 to 48 percent.

In the previous head-to-head poll, Trump was again down three points, 46 to 49 percent. So again we have a three-point swing in Trump’s direction.

C-SPAN

This is the final national poll of the 2024 election season from NY Times/Sienna. In 2020, this same pollster’s final national poll said Joe Biden would win by nine points. We are told the final result was Biden winning by exactly half that, at 4.5 points.

Equally important is what has happened in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average poll of national polls. As of right now, that all-important poll is tied at 48.5 to 48.5 percent. Six polls show Kamala with a slim lead. Six polls show Trump with a slim lead. One poll is tied.

Harris has led in the RCP average poll of national polls since August 5 with a consistent lead of two to three points. In a little over a week, she has lost that lead with a steady round of national polls showing Trump edging slightly ahead.

There is just no question where the momentum is. Trump enjoys a small but stubborn lead in all seven swing states. Additionally, the early voting in swing states like North Carolina and Nevada should give the GOP a sense of cautious optimism. Never before have Republicans led in the early vote at this point in any presidential race. At the very least those results do tell us where the enthusiasm is.

Also of note in the NY Times/Sienna poll is that Trump ties Harris on favorability, 48 to 48 percent. Looks like Kamala’s closing argument — Orange Hitler Won’t Let You Kill Your Baby — isn’t working.

Trump winning the national vote would send Democrats right over the edge. It will be a beautiful thing to witness these idiots burn down their own neighborhoods.

The New York Times itself is attempting to grapple with the idea Trump could win the national popular vote, but only in a scenario where CacklyMcNeverBorderCzar pulls off an electoral college upset:

It goes without saying that this shows an extremely close race — and it’s not the only poll to do so. Over the last week or so, several high-quality polls have showed a tied race or even had Mr. Trump pulling ahead. A Wall Street Journal poll, for instance, found Mr. Trump up three points, while CNBC showed him two points ahead. … As a result, I wouldn’t completely write off a Harris win in the Electoral College even if Mr. Trump narrowly won the popular vote. I’m absolutely not saying it’s likely. It may be a bit too much to ask Ms. Harris to sweep each of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan if she’s losing so much ground elsewhere in the nation. It may seem especially challenging in these particular states, as the polls have erred here in recent cycles. One also wonders whether the Arab American and Muslim population in Michigan, angry over the war in Gaza, might just get Mr. Trump over the edge in this scenario.

The race is closer than close and polling accuracy (or a lack thereof) could result in all sorts of outcomes.

But there are a few things we know for sure…

The Harris campaign is acting like a losing campaign — dark and desperate.

The Trump campaign is acting like a winning campaign — happy warriors.

All the damaging leaks second-guessing the campaign’s strategy are coming from the Harris campaign.

The early vote looks good five and six days in when many expected things to level off by now.

Trump has never-ever-ever polled this well.

Ten days and change to go.

John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.
“The View” co-hosts sparred with former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Friday after he suggested that Republican nominee Donald Trump might win in November.

Christie said Harris has had “a bad 10 days” and is still unknown by the public, which he argued may have negative consequences for her on Election Day. The co-hosts heatedly argued that Harris is known by the public because she has been in office for 4 years and added that criticizing Harris is not helping her win.

“I think she’s had a bad 10 days,” Christie said. “There’s an advantage and disadvantage to coming into the race as late as she did. The advantage is she didn’t have to go through all the primaries and go through all that that kind of wears you down a little bit, but the disadvantage is that people don’t know her.”

“She’s been the vice president for almost 4 years, how can they not know her?” co-host Sunny Hostin interrupted, leading Christie to say vice presidents are often not known.

Christie further criticized Harris for not naming a policy that she would do differently from President Joe Biden during her Oct. 8 appearance on “The View,” suggesting her answer was dishonest. Hostin said the vice president is not going to openly criticize Biden, while co-host Joy Behar argued the Republican side is much worse than the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: ‘Don’t Give Me That!’: Chris Christie Pushes Back As ‘The View’ Co-Hosts Gang Up On Him)

Harris has come under fire for not saying what she would do differently than Biden and for her performance during the Wednesday town hall on CNN, where she was accused of delving into “word salads.” Her popularity has waned significantly in a matter of weeks since she started her media blitz, causing Trump to secure a lead in some recent national polls.

The former governor said Harris needs “to close the deal” on the undecided voters who are unsure about her and know they do not want to support Trump. Co-host Ana Navarro then accused Christie of holding Harris to a higher standard than Trump.

“What we’re doing here is exactly what Charlamagne Tha God was talking about yesterday,” Navarro said. “We are holding her to this high standard of her closing message needs to be this, this, this and that. [Trump’s] closing message is Arnold Palmer’s package, dancing for 39 minutes like a whacko-job, making fries at McDonalds, so why don’t you tell him? What about his closing message? What do you think about that?”

“What I think about that is he is who he’s always been, and he’s not gonna gain any voters in these last 10 days,” Christie said.

Navarro said Christie intentionally does not want to criticize Trump’s campaign strategy and instead go after Harris.

“You don’t want to talk about this. You’re spending all this time criticizing Kamala!” Navarro shouted.

“No, I’m not criticizing. Let me be clear, Ana, you go to open your ears. What I’m saying is I’m trying to give her suggestions on how I think she can close the deal. That’s the difference,” Christie said. “The bottom line is, I’m not here to be a cheerleader for her, I’m here to say, based on what I’ve learned in politics over time, what she needs to do is close the deal.”

Christie further argued Republican voters have already made up their minds on voting for Trump, but Harris has the chance to campaign on being a president for all Americans rather than being a partisan Democrat. Navarro argued Republicans should change their minds after Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly, alleged that he “met the definition of a fascist” and praised former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, which the Trump campaign has denied.

Donald Trump might be the next President of the United States — again.

At this point in the race in 2016, after the third presidential debate failed to move the polls, I was convinced that Trump was likely to lose to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

It was only in the last days of October, with FBI director James Comey re-opening Clinton’s email investigation, and massive crowds waiting for Trump in the cold at every stop, that I began rethinking things.

Trump won by surprise in 2016. If he wins in 2024, it will not be a surprise, but a redemption — the most incredible political comeback in American history.

Trump was supposed to be in prison by now, or dead. It was sheer luck — or divine intervention — that a bullet missed his brain and grazed his ear instead. And the slew of legal challenges — civil and criminal, state and federal — were intended to end his political career in shame.

In mid-2022, with memories of the Capitol riot still fresh, and a new conservative champion emerging in Florida governor Ron DeSantis, it was possible to imagine that Republicans would move beyond Trump on their own.

The results of the midterm elections that year, when DeSantis romped to reelection and Trump’s endorsed candidates largely went down to defeat, it seemed that perhaps Trump’s appeal to conservative voters really might be fading.

But Trump’s nomination had already been secured in the early morning hours of August 8, 2022, when the FBI raided the former president’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach County, Florida. The sight of federal agents, armed to the teeth, brushing past the Secret Service to search for missing documents was shocking.

Even Republicans who might have preferred an alternative to Trump began to rally behind him: this could not stand.

The more indictments and lawsuits Trump’s opponents threw at him, the more he rallied Republican support. Conservatives wondered if the “lawfare” tactic was perhaps a clever trap, designed to ensure that Trump would capture the Republican nomination but lose in the general election.

It was a “win-win” situation for Democrats: Trump could end up in prison, and broke — but if not, he would emerge as the worst presidential candidate ever.

If that was the plan, it backfired, for three reasons.

One is that President Joe Biden really has been a failure. He triggered an inflationary spiral with his “American Rescue Plan” in early 2021. He created the migration crisis by reversing Trump’s effective border policies. Then he destroyed public confidence in his administration with the disastrous Afghanistan pullout. And that was all in the first year. Kamala Harris was a part of it all.

Another reason is that Trump has simply refused to quit. The sight of him standing up, bleeding from his head, raising his fist, and shouting “Fight!” is one of the most iconic images in American history, emulating our national character. But Trump did more than perform heroic gestures. He also humbled himself to ask voters for their support. His stint at McDonald’s this week was not just a one-off: he has been doing things like that the entire campaign.

Yet the biggest reason Democrats’ tactics backfired is that the American people reject them. We recoil at the abuse of power and the perversion of justice.

Democrats should have known that, after using the George Floyd incident to arouse civil unrest in 2020.

The perception of injustice became reality in Trump’s cases.

Win or lose, Trump never should have had a chance. The fact that he has come this far is a redemption — for him, and for the nation as well. We, too, can come back from the brink.

Vice President Kamala Harris claims former President Donald Trump will weaponize the government against his political opponents, but Democrats are already targeting one of Trump’s chief supporters – Elon Musk.

Musk’s enterprise has increasingly been targeted since he purchased Twitter in 2022 and began staunchly supporting Trump. Washington’s bureaucracy and thousands of regulations enable officials to target him, experts told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Elon Musk Takes Important Scalp In War On Censorship)

“I think if Harris wins, they will launch multiple criminal investigations of Elon Musk,” former U.S. District Attorney for Utah and Executive Director of Right On Crime, Brett Tolman, told the Daily Caller. “There’s no question.”

Musk’s companies are currently tangled up in numerous battles over federal investigations and regulations. Musk’s companies Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and X are all involved in investigations and regulatory battles with various agencies.

Tolman said other countries could target Musk and his company X, formerly Twitter.

“You have countries that have indicated they’re going to launch an investigation,” Tolman stated. “So, I think it is a pivotal moment for Elon Musk.”

X was recently reinstated after a months-long feud with the Brazilian government over its content moderation policies. But European authorities have indicated they could retaliate against Musk for being too supportive of free speech.

Former Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and author of “The Power And The Money,” Tevi Troy, told the Caller there are risks to Musk supporting Trump – even if he wins. Powerful CEOs have openly allied with presidents in the past, he said, but it can be fraught. (Stream Daily Caller’s documentary ‘Rigged’ HERE)

He pointed to the founder of Time Magazine, Henry Luce.

“Luce put his thumb on the scale in the way few CEOs have done history,” Troy said. “He was very anti-Franklin Roosevelt and tried to defeat him in multiple elections, unsuccessfully.”

Luce also backed Dwight Eisenhower for president in 1952 and directed his magazine to write favorably of the future president. There are parallels between Luce and Musk’s support for presidential candidates, Troy told the Caller. He emphasized that Time’s reputation suffered because it was viewed as biased, and that such action opens it up to unequal enforcement of the law.

“They can pick on an individual company or individual CEO and say, we’re going to enforce every regulation against this guy, right?” Troy said. “So if Harris wins, that’s a potential danger.”

It is not unique for federal agencies to target Musk’s businesses during the Biden-Harris administration.

“There are countless examples of the DOJ acting with their hands on the scale,” Tolman told the Caller.

Last year, the Department of Justice sued SpaceX for allegedly discriminating against refugees and asylees in the hiring process, according to a DOJ press release. (RELATED: Biden Admin Relies On Elon Musk’s Starlink To Restore Internet After Previously Rejecting Its Bid For Award)

“You saw a drastic change that started to occur with Obama and now Biden,” Tolman told the Caller. “It’s unrecognizable, the department right now.”

The DOJ also set its sights on the construction of Musk’s Texas home and launched an investigation last September, according to TechCrunch.

“I’ve never seen the DOJ act and behave this way before,” Tolman emphasized.

The DOJ is not the only agency targeting Elon Musk – the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) allegedly tried to influence an independent assessor to “punish” Musk’s platform, according to the House Judiciary Committee.

Since Musk acquired Twitter, the FTC has sent 16 demand letters to X Corp, according to legal documents from 2023. That was an escalation from the 28 demand letters issued in the over ten years prior to Musk taking over.

Musk was recently blasted by Democrats for handing out $1 million checks to signees of his pro-Constitution petition every day before Nov. 5. The petition was launched by his “America PAC” to support the First and Second Amendments.

Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the initiative “deeply concerning.”

“It’s something that law enforcement could take a look at,” he added.

Musk stated online that signees of his petition do not need to be aligned with a particular political party. He added they do not even have to vote to qualify.

Yesterday, reports from CNN and the New York Times said the DOJ sent a letter to Musk’s America PAC, warning that the $1 million check giveaway could violate federal law. The letter was reportedly sent from the DOJ’s public integrity section, an entity involved in matters pertaining to election law, according to CNN. (RELATED: Legal Group Sues State Department, Seeks Records On Biden-Harris Admin’s Alleged Censorship)

“The scales of justice are supposed to be, you know, even balanced,” Tolman told the Caller. “[The] DOJ is supposed to be blindfolded and just administer the law regardless of who it is.”

Another risk to Musk could be brewing in the form of “Russian interference” allegations. Former and current officials in the U.S., Europe and Russia claim that since late 2022 Musk has had “regular contact” with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a Wall Street Journal report published Thursday. The article notes that Musk’s companies have government contracts, and the billionaire has a security clearance.

Allegations of ties to Russia have been weaponized in the past against the Democrats’ political opponents, most notably against Trump. “Russian collusion” later proved to be false when special counsel Robert Mueller stated he did not find cooperation between the Russian government and Trump’s campaign.

Sources told the Caller there are too many regulations on the books – and they could be weaponized against Musk.

“[There are] agencies in agencies, committees and lawmaking bodies, or rule making bodies that are within those agencies,” Tolman told the Caller. “So it’s turned into a massive web – there needs to be incredible changes.”

He added that Trump implemented a rule which mandated agencies must slash two regulations before passing a new one, and that there have been efforts by some officials to cut back on unnecessary government regulations, but it will take a president who is outside of the system to get something done. (RELATED: Supreme Court’s Move To Gut Administrative State Tees Up Trouble For Biden’s Green Power Plant Rules)

“It’s going to take someone that is actually willing to do that,” Tolman said. “The power of the bureaucrats – it’s real and substantial.”

There are 438 federal agencies. America is 248 years old. That’s nearly 2 agencies created per year over the lifetime of the country. — America (@america) October 17, 2024



Government regulations have dramatically expanded over the past 150 years, Troy told the Caller.

“When Rockefeller was building his monopoly, there was no regulatory body or regulatory rules to stop him, and now the government has rules on just about everything a company can do,” he said.

He said CEOs need to pay attention to federal regulations and understand where the company stands with the federal government. “If you’re not paying attention to that and staying on top of it, you’re not going to be a successful CEO in the current era,” Troy said.

He stated that because there are so many regulations, the government does not have the resources to enforce every single one. However, it can choose which laws to enforce and who to target, which Troy called “selective enforcement.” (RELATED: It Only Took Eight Months For Biden’s Administration To Churn Out $1.2 Trillion In New Regs)

That selective enforcement could conceivably serve as a blueprint to target other powerful Trump supporters should he lose the election. Musk isn’t the only Silicon Valley mogul to shift toward support for Trump in recent years; others, like Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire, San Francisco billionaire David Sacks, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen are among the numerous millionaires and billionaires who have backed Trump.

They, too, could face additional regulatory hurdles not unlike Musk.

Troy said Democratic rhetoric demonizing figures like Musk serves as a greenlight to target them.

“The rhetoric criticizing Musk from senior leaders in the Democratic Party made very evident to bureaucratic enforcement types that going after Musk would be a costless and potentially praiseworthy activity,” he said.
Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued with the liberal hosts of ABC's "The View" on Friday's show after he insisted that Vice President Harris still had more work to do to convince voters to support her. There are just 11 days until Election Day.

Christie suggested that undecided voters still didn't "know" Harris and that she had failed to distinguish herself from President Biden and his policies.

"Ten days ago I would've told you that she's going to win. And I think she's had a bad ten days," he began.

"There’s advantages and disadvantages to coming into the race this late. The advantage is she didn’t have to go through all the primaries and go through all of that that goes on that wears you down a bit. But the disadvantage is people don’t know her," he said.

JOY BEHAR TELLS CHRIS CHRISTIE TO ‘SHUT UP’ FOR FAILING TO EXPLICITLY SAY HE'LL VOTE FOR HARRIS

"She's been vice president for four years!" co-host Sunny Hostin cut in. "How could they not know her?"

Christie defended his comment by saying that the job of vice-president keeps you out of "focus" from the public, before co-host Joy Behar also interrupted.

"Why do they keep accusing her of doing nothing when she was vice president?" Behar exclaimed. "What did Mike Pence do?"

Christie went on to say that Harris needs to make clear to voters what she would do differently from President Biden, after she's struggled to answer this question in multiple interviews.

"I watched you guys that day. When you asked her, you know, ‘what would you do different than Biden?’ She didn’t say it. I got to believe there are things she would disagree with him on. You’re human beings and she is a bright woman with a mind of her own and she clearly is going to have times where she looked at President Biden and said, 'Eh, I wouldn’t do that.' Say it!" he said.

"They've had a successful administration though, and she's not going to throw him under the bus," Hostin pushed back.

"There's a difference, Sunny, between throwing him under the bus and saying, I had an honest disagreement with someone on x., whatever it is. You can have an honest disagreement with someone you have enormous respect for," Christie said.

"Compared to the other side, that's nothing!" Behar retorted.

Christie said "the point" he was making was that undecided voters will not make their decision on whether they "hate Trump enough" but whether they feel confident that Harris would make a good president.



"They're open to her. She’s got to close the deal and that’s why I think, even now ten days out, it’s too early to say someone or the other is going to win," he said.

Later in the segment, fellow co-host Ana Navarro lashed out at Christie, saying that he was "holding to her a higher standard" than Trump by saying she hadn't honed in on her closing message to voters.

"You're spending all this time criticizing Kamala!" she said.

"I'm not criticizing," Christie said.

"Sounds like criticism to me," Navarro reacted.

"Well then you've got to open your ears. What I'm saying is trying to give her suggestions on how I think she can close the deal. That's the difference. The bottom line is, I'm not here to be a cheerleader for her…she has an opportunity to go up," Christie responded.
HOUSTON, TX - With 11 days to go until Election Day and two leading national polls indicating a dead heat in the race for the White House between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the major party nominees hold campaign events in Texas where they'll elevate two combustible issues as they make their closing arguments.

Harris, who has long leaned into the issue of reproductive rights, will blame Trump for an extremely restrictive abortion law in Texas, as she holds what's expected to be a large rally in Houston.

Trump, who has spotlighted illegal immigration ever since he launched his first White House run nine years ago, was in Austin to make comments on border security.

DO HARRIS OR TRUMP HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN THIS KEY CAMPAIGN METRIC

While Texas isn't one of the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and are likely to determine if Harris or the former president wins the 2024 election, it is home to a key Senate race that's among a handful that will decide if the GOP wins back the chamber's majority.

Conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz joined Trump at the afternoon event in Austin, while Democratic challenger Rep. Collin Allred will speak at the Harris rally hours later.

The stop by Harris in Houston is the first time in decades that a Democratic Party standard-bearer will hold a major campaign event in Texas in the home stretch ahead of Election Day.

MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP AT THIS STAR-STUDDED POLITICAL RALLY

The trip doesn't mean the Harris campaign thinks Texas is in play in the White House race. Even though Biden narrowed the gap to a five and a half point deficit in the 2020 presidential election, top Harris advisers don't harbor any illusions about flipping the state.

Instead, the trip is about elevating abortion, which has been a winning issue for Democrats ever since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court in the summer of 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had legalized abortion for decades.

Harris will reiterate her message that Trump, who named three conservative justices to the high court during his four years in the White House, is to blame for the abortion law in Texas, where the procedure is banned after six weeks of pregnancy.

Ahead of the rally, the Harris campaign unveiled a new ad that uses a clip of Trump taking credit for his role in the blockbuster Supreme Court abortion decision, as well as another commercial that features a Texas couple directly impacted by the state's ban.

And Harris will discuss the importance of reproductive rights in the 2024 election in an interview while in Texas with Brene Brown, a popular podcaster with a predominantly female audience.

The Harris campaign says the vice president will be joined at the rally by a number of people who will share their stories of the consequences they have faced due to the Texas abortion ban.

Expected to perform at the rally are legendary singer, songwriter and guitarist Willie Nelson and entertainment superstar Beyoncé, who is considered a cultural icon. Beyoncé's hit song "Freedom" has been adopted by the vice president as her campaign trail anthem.

Trump, at his event in Austin, argued that Harris had "picked the wrong place" to visit as he alluded to her stop in Houston.

"Today she’s in Texas to rub shoulders with woke celebrities," he charged.

Harris, speaking with reporters in Houston on Friday afternoon, chided Trump for his comments, arguing that "it's just another example of how he really belittles our country."

For Trump and Republicans, immigration and border security has been a winning issue, as they have blasted President Biden and Harris for three and a half years for the influx of migrants across the southern border.

Trump, who has repeatedly pledged to conduct mass deportations if he wins back the White House, charged during a campaign event in Arizona on Thursday that as a result of Biden administration immigration policies, the U.S. is "like a garbage can for the world."

While in Texas, Trump will also sit for a recorded interview with extremely popular nationally known podcaster Joe Rogan.

Youngkin vows to fight judge's halt to voter roll cleanup

A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to halt its removal of potential noncitizens from state voter rolls, a decision expected to restore the voting rights to some 1,600 residents ahead of Election Day.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told Fox News shortly after the ruling that his administration is planning to file an emergency stay for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to block the injunction, which he noted was handed down just 11 days before the election.

He added that his administration would appeal it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , if necessary. …Read more

LAS VEGAS, Nevada — For thousands of attendees at a Trump rally Thursday in Las Vegas, volunteers stood ready to collect mail-in ballots on-site.

The strategy is a major shift for Nevada Republicans, who opposed the legalization of ballot harvesting in 2020. Now, conservative activists and GOP operatives are leaning into the new rules, asking voters to bring ballots to rallies and doing whatever it take to make it easy for Republicans get their votes in early.

“We don’t like early voting, but it’s how the game is,” Turning Point Action Las Vegas field representative Schayden Gorai told the Daily Caller News Foundation, explaining these are “the rules that the Democrats have set.”

Early voting numbers have been strong for Republicans, who lead Democrats by nearly 24,000 votes between in-person and mail ballots as of Friday morning. If Democrats can’t change the current margins, which have them up in mail ballots but trailing Republicans by 25% for in-person early voting, longtime Nevada political reporter and editor of The Nevada Independent Jon Ralston wrote Thursday night the party is in “big, big trouble.”

Take a deeper look at Nevada — and what it could mean for the rest of the country. Ds aren’t showing up for @KamalaHarris. If that happens around the country, the missing red wave of 2022 could show up in 2024 as a tsunami. These are the in-person early voting stats for 2024… https://t.co/S5gf6hYUzb pic.twitter.com/tQfR19c2oE — Victor Joecks (@VictorJoecks) October 25, 2024



Former President Donald Trump — and others who spoke at the Turning Point sponsored rally Thursday, including Vivek Ramaswamy, Charlie Kirk and Tulsi Gabbard — urged supporters in the crowd to get out early and bring others along.

Prior to the rally, a text blast was sent out letting attendees know about the ballot drop off option. Fliers and other messaging likewise encouraged supporters to bring their ballots.

Republicans launched the new approach when Trump spoke in Reno earlier this month. Now that more people know about the option, campaign staff say the method is gaining some traction.

“We had a whole envelope full of ballots dropped off today, which is really exciting to see,” Halee Dobbins, GOP communications director for Nevada and Arizona, told the DCNF during the rally. “The margins are always close, but we don’t want to leave one vote on the table.” (RELATED: Tailgates, Apps And Marylanders: Conservatives’ Strategy To Win In Southern Pennsylvania)

While many voters maintain reservations about mail ballots, the messaging is landing with some.

Jennifer McGrath, a Las Vegas resident of two years who has volunteered for the Trump campaign, appreciates the convenience of dropping off her ballot while she’s already at the rally. She said it helps her avoid the risk of an issue coming up on election day that prevents her from making it to the polls.

“I also received a receipt which lets me know how to check on the status of my ballot,” she said. “That way within about 48 hours I will know that my ballot has been delivered to the vote center and counted.”

The collection at the rally is only part of a broader strategy Turning Point calls “ballot chasing.”

“We’ve hired full time staffers here, especially in congressional district three, in our low propensity targeted districts and precincts to help to get out that vote,” Gorai said.

At around 20 “Super Chase” events in the past month, volunteers and staffers partnered together to door knock and ensure voters have what they need.

“That might be taking them to the polls, helping them to get the ballot in the mail, helping them to take that to a drop box, whatever it might look like,” Gorai said. “Whatever is easier for the voter is how we approach that ballot.”

While there has been a more aggressive effort to secure ballots, those working with the Trump campaign believe the GOP’s election integrity efforts have also given voters the confidence to turn out in greater number.

The state party has pushed poll watchers to Clark and Washoe county locations and launched a hotline in southern and northern Nevada.

“I think just having a presence, Republican voters knowing that there are volunteer poll watchers at these locations monitoring the process, I think it really helps those folks,” Nevada GOP executive director Alex Watson told the DCNF. “Just knowing that we have people there that have the best thoughts in mind for the election, making sure it’s safe, secure for everybody.”

Nicole Kelly, a political and election law attorney who served as the Republican National Lawyers Association’s Nevada Political Director in 2022, told the DCNF that highlighting how GOP lawyers are involved in the process has given voters faith issues will be handled in timely manner, not just after election day.

Nevada State Democratic Party spokesperson Carlos Perez criticized Republicans in a statement to the DCNF for “participating in the same legal process they’ve been telling lies about for years.” (RELATED: Election Litigation Could Shape The Race In Battleground States. We Won’t Know Until The Votes Are Cast.)

“As we’ve said all along, this election will be close and Nevada Democrats will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure we elect Democrats up and down the ballot,” Perez said.

Watson believes the main driver of Republicans turning out to vote early is genuine enthusiasm.

“People want to go out and vote for the president,” Watson said. “We’re seeing the messaging really hitting on like the economy and inflation, and I think that’s been a winning message for us, especially in this state. We’re a tourism-based economy, so we get hit hard when the inflation is high and the economy is bad.”

Trump voters who spoke with the DCNF at the rally and early voting sites consistently named the economy and immigration as top concerns. Multiple who voted early said they just wanted to get it out of the way.

One first-time voter said she has been a long-time Trump supporter but choose to finally vote because it’s been “so bad” the last three years. “We need to make a change,” she said.

A 32-year Democrat who has lived in Las Vegas for nearly four decades told the DCNF he switched his registration this year to vote for Trump in the caucus.

Republicans messaging aims to motivate voters by assuring them their vote will make an impact and making sure they understand how crucial it is in a swing state like Nevada.

“You’re at the center and at the heart of this election,” Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Las Vegas voters Thursday. “I truly believe that how this state goes is how the election is going to go.”

As Vice President Kamala Harris slips in the polls, the Democratic National Committee/Harris campaign/mainstream media fusion talking points become even more absurd.

Claiming that J.D. Vance and Donald Trump were “weird” did not work — especially given the genuinely odd behavior of vice presidential candidate Tim Walz and would-be First Gentleman Doug Emhoff.

Nor was the next Harris meme convincing that the frenetic and non-stop Trump was somehow “exhausted,” “senile” and “confused.” Voters know the workdays of the younger Harris are usually far shorter — or sometimes not workdays at all.

But Harris also falsely claimed the physically and mentally challenged President Joe Biden was, in her words, “absolutely authoritative” and “very bold and vibrant.”

Now Harris asserts that Trump is a “fascist,” a “dictator” and “unfit” for office. But this new talking point will also not stop the Harris campaign’s hemorrhaging — and for a variety of reasons.

First, voters see the election as a conflict of two absolutely antithetical visions.

On the one hand, is the prior Trump 2017-20 concrete record: border security, no major wars abroad, calm in the Middle East, a deterred Russia, Iran and China, low inflation, low interest rates, lower crime, lower taxes, strong deterrent military — and opposition to mandatory electric vehicle mandates, biological males competing in women’s sports and the woke/DEI agenda.

On the other hand, is the Biden-Harris 2021-2024 record: the unchecked entry of 12-20 million illegal aliens and a destroyed border. People still struggle under Biden-Harris’s earlier hyperinflation and high interest rates. The horrific regional wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue. Biden-Harris embraces the unpopular DEI/Woke agenda.

Harris herself knows that the Biden-Harris years were a failure. That is why she has shed almost all of their hard left-wing agendas — policies she has embraced for much of her adult life.

So suddenly, in the last 90 or so days, Harris has completely flipped and flopped.

Now she is for more of, not defunding, the police. She pivots for a secure border, not 20 million illegal aliens pouring across it. Harris brags about fossil fuel energy, not banning fracking, and for increasing, not cutting, defense.

In fact, several endangered incumbent Democratic senators in swing states are claiming more allegiance to Trump’s issues than identifying with Harris and her unpopular record as vice president.

Voters likely conclude that if Trump doubles down on his record, while even Harris and many senators temporarily piggyback on it, then it must be more effective and popular than Harris’s own.

Second, Harris now claims Trump is a fascist and insurrectionist.

But mouthing ad nausaem “January 6th” no longer persuades voters that Trump is a danger to anyone. They recall that Harris bragged of the far more violent demonstrations of 2020 — at least 25 killed, $2 billion in damage, 1,500 law enforcement officers injured, 14,000 arrested — that the unrest would not and “should not” stop, while drumming up support to bail out jailed violent protestors.

Nor does the slur that Trump is a fascist resonate. The Obama and Biden-Harris administrations weaponized the CIA and FBI to interfere in the 2016 and 2020 elections by peddling the fake Steele dossier and suppressing all the embarrassing news about Hunter Biden’s incriminating laptop.

Trump certainly did not coordinate, as Biden did, with local, state and federal prosecutors to wage lawfare prosecutions to destroy his political opponents. He did not use the FBI to partner with social media to suppress the news.

Neither Trump nor his supporters tried to remove Biden from state ballots.

The Republican House majority did not impeach Biden twice despite the Biden family’s corruption and Joe Biden’s unlawful, decades-long removal of classified papers to several insecure private residences.

Trump and the Republicans never coercively removed the party’s primary-winning nominee. They did not nullify the will of 14 million primary voters. And in backroom fashion, they did not anoint a candidate who had never entered a single primary in her life.

Nor did Trump support packing the Supreme Court. He does not seek unconstitutional means of destroying the Electoral College. He is not demanding an end to the Senate filibuster or the creation of two new states to obtain four partisan senate seats.

Third, as for Trump being “unfit” and lacking “decorum,” it depends on what were the Biden-Harris standards?

Having a trans activist reveal his breasts on camera at a White House “pride party?”

Biden’s reportedly calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an “f—ing a—hole” and “son of a b—ch?” Bragging about locking Trump up, while waging lawfare against him?

Unleashing son Hunter Biden with impunity to shake down foreign governments?

The election will not be decided on these empty talking points or fake media-generated narratives.

Instead, only two criteria matter: Which candidate’s past record and current agenda best appeal to voters? And which candidate seems the most authentic and genuine?

Americans’ support for a secure border is “pure racism,” a Democratic Party organizer in Ohio told an undercover journalist, according to an Ohio online news source.

“I’m all for just like, open the f… border,” organizer Kevin Oyakawa allegedly told the undercover journalist.

Oyakawa was hired by the Democrats’ Ohio Coordinated Campaign to boost voter turnout for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rep. Emilia Sykes (D-OH), Ohio.news reported.

Oyakawa continued, according to the report:

I don’t give a shit about who comes in here — we don’t need Border Patrol. But the issue with even talking about immigration here in Ohio is that it’s a losing issue for Democrats here for no fucking reason other than people’s pure racism. So that’s why it’s probably really hard to find anything about where she [Sykes] stands on it. In terms of the way that she talks to the public, if she has to address immigration, she starts losing.

Nationwide, Democrats — led by Kamala Harris — are trying to downplay their pro-migration policies in the 2024 election, amid rising public opposition to their wealth-shifting economic policy of Extraction Migration.

Ohio.news reported:

Sykes’ district, which includes Akron and parts of Canton, is a tossup. Her opponent, Republican Kevin Coughlin, has called for securing the border. An August poll showed Sykes narrowly leading Coughlin, but 14% of the district remained undecided at that point—with the poll’s margin of error, the race is statistically tied.

Sykes has an F rating from NumbersUSA, which tracks how members vote on pro-American migration legislation. For example, in January 2024, she urged passage of a bill that would amnesty illegal migrants, and also import more desperate workers to compete for jobs sought by young Americans.

The bill would also raise rents because the extra migrants would compete for housing, and would drive up the welfare spending that keeps migrants out of poverty.

In February 2024, Brown voted for the misnamed border bill that would have dramatically accelerated the flow of wage-cutting economic migrants into Americans’ workplaces and housing via the asylum loophole.

In contrast, Moreno has promised to support pro-American migration policies. New migrants, he said, “have to add to our economy and never lower [Americans’] wages,” he told Breitbart News on October 24.

Sykes’ vehement opposition to border control is a big problem for the Democratic Party in the 2024 race because it is commonplace through the party’s progressive cadres. The progressives’ widespread pro-migration views have made it difficult for Harris and party leaders to offer a popular policy amid Donald Trump’s pro-American policies.

“De facto open[-borders] immigration is a litmus test issue now on the left,” Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. He continued:

It is an irreducible value. Every interest group or constituency group on the left sacrifices its ostensible interests [once] they conflict with unlimited immigration. They can’t even compromise when the election outcome depends on it … [because] I it is unacceptable in the activist class on the left to have any doubts about mass immigration. [For donors and CEOs] I don’t think it’s just a matter of investors figuring “This is good for my bottom line.” Yes, it is. But those those guys at the top of big companies are emotionally and psychologically post-American already. Both their financial interest and their broader [post-American] worldview overlap here, so they think they’re doing good and they are happy they’re also doing well [economically].

“They see themselves as citizens of the world — [so they believe] immigration control is an atavistic and evil thing,” he added.
A foreign billionaire funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to a leftist dark money donor behind Ohio ballot measure Issue 1 — a redistricting initiative that could give Democrats a permanent advantage in Ohio. The state enacted a ban on foreign funding of such initiatives earlier this year.

Ohio residents will vote in November on Issue 1, which would establish a commission of “non-politician” appointees to redraw district lines, according to Ballotpedia. The commission would consist of five Republican members, five Democrat members, and five independent or otherwise affiliated members.

The primary group behind Issue 1 — Citizens Not Politicians — has taken funding from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a branch of leftist dark money giant Arabella Advisors, financial records show. According to a watchdog report, the group has received hundreds of millions in funding from Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss.

Republicans and election integrity advocates have raised concerns about the initiative, arguing it could essentially result in redistricting that largely favors Democrats, possibly helping the party gain control of Congress.

“What they’re after is the ultimate prize of flipping three to four congressional seats in the state of Ohio,” Republican state Sen. Rob McColley told The Federalist.“That would potentially be the difference between the control of the United States House of Representatives being Republican or Democrat.”

Honest Elections Project Executive Director Jason Snead echoed these concerns, equating the initiative to “a power grab by the left” that’s “designed to do an end run around the democratic process in Ohio.”

“It’s all designed to be entirely insulated from political accountability and, basically, from public opinion,” Snead told The Federalist. “It could wind up getting enough new Democrats elected in Ohio that this could decide which party controls Congress in 2026.”

Dark Money From Overseas

Wyss — who some conservatives have termed the “New Soros” — has given at least $243 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund “since its inception,” according to an October 2024 report from watchdog Americans for Public Trust (APT). The Sixteen Thirty Fund, according to the report, “takes advantage of foreign influence loopholes” to, among other things, “bankroll efforts to elevate the Biden-Harris agenda,” “invest in massive voter turnout operations,” and “support ballot issue campaigns.” In Ohio alone, the Sixteen Thirty Fund spent close to $15 million to affect the state’s policies, according to the report.

APT Executive Director Caitlin Sutherland told The Federalist that from October 2023 to June 2024, the Sixteen Thirty Fund had given close to $7 million to Citizens Not Politicians.

“They’re the group’s number one donor,” Sutherland said.

Although federal law bans foreign contributions to elections, the Federal Elections Committee has held that this ban does not include contributions to ballot measure campaigns, as noted by Ballotpedia. Ohio closed this loophole earlier this year by banning foreign funding of ballot initiatives.

As APT reported this summer, Citizens Not Politicians received $6 million from the Sixteen Thirty Fund the same day Republican Gov. Mike DeWine called a special session to pass the ban. According to Sutherland, this was the “biggest cash infusion” from the leftist dark money group to Citizens Not Politicians.

“We became aware of the Sixteen Thirty Fund’s involvement through the campaign finance disclosures,” said McColley, who introduced a similar ban on foreign funding for ballot measures. “After doing some research, we realized pretty quickly that the Sixteen Thirty Fund’s primary funder is Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss. It immediately caused us to ask the question, ‘How is this permitted?’”

McColley said the effort faced “more opposition than we anticipated” in the state House. Still, HB 1 passed on mostly partisan lines, and Gov. DeWine signed the ban into law in June.

A subsequent lawsuit brought in part by the Elias Law Group — the firm headed by infamous Trump-Russia hoax peddler Marc Elias — claimed that the restriction imposed on free speech, as The Associated Press previously reported. The case is still in progress, but earlier this month, a judge allowed Ohio to enforce the law in time for the 2024 election.

Citizens Not Politicians paid Elias’ firm nearly $70,000 for “legal services” between October 2023 and June 2024, according to records from Ohio’s campaign finance database. It paid the firm $7,500 just days before the special session.

The group’s campaign filing from July shows a “balance on hand” of zero dollars and total expenditures of more than $24.8 million. Its most recent filing from Oct. 24 indicates this balance is still zero.

The group is reportedly running millions of dollars worth of ads ahead of the election promoting the redistricting change.

“It’s a bunch of pre-booked ads paid for with this foreign-backed cash, which by the way is now illegal in Ohio, blanketing the airwaves,” Sutherland said.

The Honest Elections Project and APT recently announced their partnership to launch a six-figure digital ad campaign “exposing foreign-funding of Issue 1 in Ohio.”

The Sixteen Thirty Fund stopped funding Citizens Not Politicians after the state’s foreign funding ban took effect, APT posted on X on Friday, citing recent documents. “This is even more evidence that Sixteen Thirty Fund is a conduit for foreign money.”

Rigging The Electorate

Citizens Not Politicians claims passing Issue 1 would “ban politicians from gerrymandering” —or the “rigging voting districts” — by “putting citizens in charge” of redistricting.

In reality, such a model would enable a bureaucratically appointed commission to draw districts with the intention of making them lean either Republican or Democrat so that the proportion of districts controlled by each party matches the political leanings of the state’s overall population.

For example, Snead said if the statewide population breaks down to 53 percent Republicans versus 43 percent Democrats, the commission would be designed to ensure “the state will elect 53 percent of its representatives as Republicans and 47 percent as Democrats.”

The Ohio measure would eliminate the current requirement that “state legislative and congressional districts” be “compact.” Instead, as both Snead and McColley explained, the proposed amendment would allow the division of left-wing cities into different districts where their population can overwhelm rural conservatives.

McColley said the measure would “put gerrymandering into [Ohio’s] Constitution” by “drawing districts solely to favor one party over the other” and “splitting up political subdivisions solely for political advantage.”

“Those blue islands will be cracked up into as many districts as possible to maximize the number of Democrat districts,” McColley said.

In 2021, state Democrats adopted a similar strategy when redrawing district lines in Oregon. They divided the Portland Metro Area into four different districts (instead of the previous three), turning many of the state’s rural Republican areas into majority-Democrat districts.

Ohio already has a redistricting commission, including the governor, secretary of state, auditor, and appointees chosen by state Senate and House leaders. The new commission — funded by taxpayers — would appoint members from a pool of “applicants” through a screening process overseen by retired partisan judges, according to the initiative’s text.

The initiative would “require the commission to immediately create new legislative and congressional districts in 2025 to replace the most recent districts,” so the measure could drastically reshape Ohio’s political geography as soon as next year.

“You’re going to see the changes go into effect almost immediately, where communities will be needlessly split up for political advantage,” McColley said. “Anti-gerrymandering provisions that are in our current constitution will be completely subrogated to the thought that each district shall be drawn for the political advantage of one party over the other.”

Leftist groups successfully codified abortion as a right in Ohio’s constitution last year, as The Federalist previously reported. Democrats are expanding ballot measure efforts nationwide, pushing abortion, marijuana, mail-in voting, and ranked-choice voting.

Snead said left-wing dark money groups are backing these efforts in strategic areas.

“We’ve seen this explosion in the use of citizen initiative processes across the country to push progressive agendas,” he said. “They write these measures to accomplish 110 percent of what they could ever dream of.”

Sutherland said the Sixteen Thirty Fund is heavily investing in states that are “competitive battleground presidential states, or a competitive U.S. Senate race, or both.”

Americans have already cast 30 million votes in the first weeks of early voting, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab.

The number of early votes suggests Americans are highly motivated to cast their ballot before Election Day, which saves the Trump and Harris campaigns time and money.

WATCH — CNN’s Enten: Trump May Win the Popular Vote, “He Could Make History”:

Swing state early voting data, which is more valuable than polling, appears to be benefiting former President Donald Trump thus far.

More on Trump’s preliminary lead is here.

Republicans took the lead in cumulative early voting in North Carolina and continued to hold it for a couple of days. The lead is historic in the modern era, political analysts say. The Tar Heel State already passed its 2020 record for the first day of early voting, surpassing the 1 million ballot mark.

The state’s board of elections reported on the data:

As of 8 a.m. Thursday, more than 2 million voters had cast ballots in the 2024 general election in North Carolina, according to preliminary State Board of Elections data. The ballots cast number represents a statewide turnout of about 26% of North Carolina’s nearly 7.8 million registered voters. … Through the end of the day Wednesday, nearly 1,888,000 voters had cast ballots in person during the first seven days of the early voting period. That’s an increase of 6.6% over 2020, when more than 1,761,000 voters had cast ballots after seven days of in-person voting. Factoring in increases in registered voters between 2020 and 2024, in-person early voting is up 0.4% over 2020.

Republicans also gained the early vote lead in Nevada for several days now, which appears to be a historically unusual trend. Republicans lead Democrats by about 20,000 ballots cast. Wednesday night data showed 20 percent of the Silver State-registered voters cast a ballot, for a total of 397,795 votes. Breitbart News’s Matt Boyle reported Tuesday on Nevada’s early vote:

Jon Ralston of the Nevada Independent, reporting on the early vote numbers showing a GOP lead, flashed the warning to Democrats late Monday evening out west. Ralston noted that since the rise of the political machine that the late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid built for Democrats this has never happened. “Republicans lead statewide in Nevada after three days of early voting and mail ballot counting,” Ralston wrote in a blog post on his outlet’s website recounting the first few days of voting in the Silver State. “This has not happened in a presidential year in The Reid Machine Era, which encompasses the races since 2008. This could signal serious danger for the Dems and for Kamala Harris here.” The key for Democrats to regain their footing in the coming days, Ralston noted, will be building up a bigger “firewall” of mail votes in Clark County, which includes the most populous city in the state Las Vegas. But for now, Republicans have in his words “reduced” that “Clark firewall to almost nothing” and are running up the score in more rural counties.

In Georgia, the state’s secretary of state announced its first-day voting totals (2,368,812) were more than doubled North Carolina’s record number (more than 1 million). More than 25 percent of the electorate have already voted, according to the secretary of state. The Peach State does not track early vote party affiliation, but more than half of early voter data suggests women represent about 55 percent of the early vote.

The Hill reported a breakdown of the nationwide trends, according to Election Lab:

With less than two weeks until Election Day, former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a neck and neck race for the White House.

But one of the architects of Trump's 2016 victory believes the former president will win in a "narrow landslide."

"Trump won in 2016 by 77,000 votes. Biden won in 2020 by 44,000 votes out of 166,500,000 cast. So sure, these races have been tighter than a tick. But guess what? I think Trump is on track for what I call a narrow landslide," Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway said during Fox Nation's "Here's the Deal."

"A narrow landslide means that Trump gets the extra 12,000 there, an extra 8,000 there, 44,000 there. He can run the tables in these seven swing states. And if he wins five, even six of them, that's a narrow landslide."

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: NEW NATIONAL POLL SHOWS WHO HAS THE EDGE 2 WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY

Conway, who was Trump's 2016 campaign manager, examined the state of the 2024 election on her Fox Nation show "Here's the Deal." The pollster dove deeper into the key issues at stake this November.

With early voting underway, a recent survey shows Trump and Harris are tied with 48% of the popular vote.

Harris led Trump nationally 49% to 46% the last time this poll was conducted in early October.

NEW BATTLEGROUND STATE POLLS SHOW GLARING GENDER GAP IN HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: ‘WHO SHOWS UP’

"In July, she became the nominee. August, she hosted a convention. In September, she parties to participate in debate. In October, her polls have gone in the opposite direction."

Another poll from the Wall Street Journal has the former president beating Harris by two points.

"It's significant because at this stage in 2020, Joe Biden was beating him by nine points, Hillary Clinton by close to ten. And we saw how that all turned out."

The latest major national poll in the 2024 race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump indicates a dead heat - the latest metric to point to a White House race well within the margin-of-error.

However, in the battle for campaign cash - another important indicator in presidential politics - there is a clear frontrunner, Vice President Harris.

According to the latest figures the two major party presidential campaigns filed with the Federal Election Commission, Harris is reported hauling in $97 million during the first half of October.

MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP AT THIS STAR-STUDDED POLITICAL RALLY

That far outpaced the $16 million the Trump campaign said it raised during the first half of this month.

Both campaigns use a slew of affiliated fundraising committees to haul in cash, and when those are included, Trump narrowed the gap but was still soundly topped $176 million to $97 million during the first two weeks of this month.

FROM ‘JOYFUL WARRIOR’ TO CALLING TRUMP A ‘FACIST’ - KAMALA HARRIS CHANGES HER MESSAGING IN THE FINAL STRETCH

The new filings also spotlight that the Harris campaign continues to vastly outspend the Trump campaign. During the first 16 days of October, the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign outspent Trump $166 million to $99 million - with paid media the top expenditure for both campaigns.

However, Harris finished the reporting period with more cash in her coffers - reporting a cash-on-hand of $119 million as of Oct. 16, with Trump at $36 million. When joint-fundraising committees are also included, Harris holds a $240 million to $168 million cash-on-hand advantage.

President Biden's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) earlier this year. However, Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump, as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

However, Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising did not last and, by early July, it began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race on July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations. Harris has vastly outpaced Trump in fundraising since taking over at the top of the Democrats' ticket.

This is not the first time Trump's faced a fundraising deficit. He raised less than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his White House victory and was outraised by Biden four years ago in his re-election defeat.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, RNC chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that "the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money."

However, he emphasized that "we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we’re talking to and feel very comfortable that we’re going to be able to see this campaign through, and we’re going to win on Nov. 5."

Fundraising is a key measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used to – among other things – hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers, and for candidate travel.
With 10 days left until the election, Brittany Mahomes isn't afraid to flaunt her faith.

After months of controversy surrounding Mahomes over showing support for former President Trump on social media and prompting questions about her friendship with Taylor Swift, who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Mahomes shared a post on her Instagram story referencing Jesus.

"Jesus didn't have to agree with people to be kind to them," the post said.

Her husband, Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, has also expressed his belief in God over the course of his career and identifies as an evangelical Christian.

"My Christian faith plays a role in everything that I do," he told reporters before the Super Bowl in February 2023. "I always ask God to lead me in the right direction and let me be who I am for His name. So, it has a role in everything that I do. Obviously, we’ll be on that huge stage in the Super Bowl that He’s given me, and I want to make sure I’m glorifying Him while I do it.

"I feel like I’ve grown in my faith these last few years, and I think that’s given me more sense of who I am and why I play the game. It just kind of relieves the pressure of playing a football game because I know that I’m on that football field to glorify Him before everything. So, it’s not about winning or losing. It's about going out there and being the best that I can in His name."

Brittany's recent post echoes a message in cryptic statements she's posted since controversy erupted over suggestions she supports Trump.

A screenshot of Mahomes' Instagram account giving a like to Trump's 2024 policy platform on Aug. 13 was shared across social media, inciting backlash. Multiple online Swift fan pages contributed to spreading screenshots of Mahomes' initial like of Trump's policy platform. Mahomes later liked a comment that said "TRUMP-VANCE 2024" on one of her Instagram posts.

Since images of that first like went viral, Mahomes has posted several similar messages defending herself from those who have attacked her image.

In one post Aug. 23, Mahomes wrote, "I mean honestly, To be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There's no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well."

In another post Aug. 26, she wrote, "Contrary to the tone of the world today… you can disagree with someone, and still love them. You can have differing views, and still be kind. Read that again!"

In an episode of the "Whoop" podcast Aug. 28, she said she has leaned on her three-time Super Bowl-winning husband to get her through the recent public scrutiny.

"Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out and doing all that type of stuff," she said. "Having him beside me and kind of guiding me, coaching me through it has helped a ton. I think that’s kind of gotten to where we are at now.

BRETT FAVRE BACKS PATRICK MAHOMES ON PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT STANCE AMID TRUMP VS. TAYLOR SWIFT CONTROVERSY

"I think the main thing he always told me is like, ‘Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don’t even know you,’" she said. "And so I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it’s just like, honestly, I don’t give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore."

The controversy surrounding the wife and pregnant mother has also earned her a big surge in support. Many people with conservative values who may have never known about Brittany Mahomes or even her husband were quick to come to her defense once the online attacks began.

And it didn't take long for her to even get the attention of Trump Sept. 4.

"I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country," Trump wrote. "With Crime and Illegal Immigration totally out of control, INFLATION Ravaging all Americans, and a World that is laughing at the stupidity of our hapless "leaders," it is nice to see someone who loves our Country, and wants to save it from DOOM. What a great couple - See you both at the Super Bowl!"

After Swift endorsed Harris Sept. 10, Trump appeared on Fox News the next morning to say he liked Brittany much "much better" than Swift.

"I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan." Trump said on "Fox & Friends." "I like Brittany. I think Brittany’s great."

Trump responsed to Swift's endorsement of Harris with a post that said "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!" just days later. There were unconfirmed rumors of Mahomes reconsidering her support for Trump after that message was posted, but Fox News Digital has not confirmed those reports.

Patrick said he would decline to endorse a candidate when asked about Trump's comments about his wife to reporters Sept. 11. But he did compliment his wife's impact on the community.

Brittany Mahomes and Swift were not in the same suite at Chiefs games early in the season during the controversy. Swift and Mahomes were later seen in the same suite during a Chiefs game against the Saints Oct. 7, and Brittany showed off a picture of Swift rubbing her pregnant belly.

Patrick said in a recent interview on "The Drive" podcast that they often let their 3-year-old daughter Sterling Skye bake with Swift.

Brittany and Patrick were raised in east Texas and started dating when they attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, a town with a population of about 8,500 that has a history of voting Republican, according to Data USA. The couple got married in March 2022 and have two children, 3-year-old daughter Sterling Skye and 1-year-old son Patrick "Bronze" Lavon Mahomes III.

The crowd at former President Donald Trump’s rally on Thursday in Tempe, Arizona, cheered when Breitbart News’s Jon Kahn dedicated the performance of his Trump tribute song “Fighter” to “the people who fight alongside [Trump] everyday, and that’s all of you.”

Taking the stage ahead of the former president, Kahn told those in attendance that his hit song, which skyrocketed to the top spot on iTunes across all charts within 24 hours of its release, was written for Trump and his supporters who fight with him.

“This is for President Trump, who takes more than any human being could ever take, and he keeps swinging for all of us. It’s also for the people who fight alongside him every day, and that’s all of you,” Kahn said to cheers from the crowd.

“Fighter” took the music industry by storm when Khan released it in September, staying at #1 in the iTunes download chart for six days. In October, it claimed the top of the Billboard Digital Sales Chart, and Kahn earned the mantle as Billboard’s #1 emerging artist.

And the song’s moving music video caught the attention of Trump supporters everywhere.

Watch the music video here:

“Fighter” has had a strong presence at Trump rallies through the fall, and the former president played it at his historic rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on October 5, at the very location where he was nearly assassinated in July.

While some may think that the attempts on Trump’s life were the inspiration for “Fighter,” Kahn drew inspiration when Trump walked up to reporters after he was convicted in the “bogus” business records case, which was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and highly criticized by top legal minds.

“I was sitting on the couch, and he’s got that walk that just says, ‘Everything’s gonna be okay. You can throw whatever you want at me, but I’m not going anywhere,'” Kahn recalled to Fox News host Trace Gallagher earlier this month.

“And I just shook my head and thought, ‘How does this man get out of bed every day?’ And I walked over to my out-of-tune piano, I played a few chords, came up with a melody and title. I brought it to Nashville and co-wrote it with an amazing songwriter named Chris Wallen,” he added.

“FIGHTER” LYRICS:

I’ve been down

Counted out

Smiling through the taste of blood

In my own mouth

I got bruises

Broken bones

But they don’t know

I ain’t in this ring alone

I’m a fighter

No one can say that I’m a run and hider

I was born to be a do or die-er

A make it righter

Don’t throw that towel just yet

Don’t cash in that last bet

Cause I hit harder when I’m tired

I’m a fighter

I get back up

That’s what I do

I didn’t soldier on this far just to lose

So take your shot

Is that all you got?

I’m a fighter

No one can say that I’m a run and hider

I was born to be a do or die-er

A make it righter

Don’t throw that towel just yet

Don’t cash in that last bet

Cause I hit harder when I’m tired

I’m a fighter

No one can keep me down

They didn’t know but they know now

That I’m a fighter

No one can say that I’m a run and hider

Don’t cash in that last bet

Don’t throw that towel just yet

I’m a fighter

By most metrics, I’d be categorized as a young conservative. I am a 22-year-old college student. I interned for a Republican in the U.S. Senate. I was elected president of my former college’s Republican club. No one would mistake me for a progressive activist.

But if you had asked me a year ago about the 2024 presidential election, I would have told you that I was hopeful the Republican Party would move on from Donald Trump. In fact, I would have supported Joe Biden before backing Trump, even though I did not like much of anything about Biden.

I believed that Trump had to be stopped at all costs.

I eagerly watched the Jan. 6 Committee hearings. I was excited when New York State Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump for financial fraud. When legal scholars from the Federalist Society wrote that the 14th Amendment barred him from the presidency, I was hopeful he might finally be done for good. When the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, I felt justice might soon be served against the man who had brought our country to the brink.

I saw the Democratic Party’s policies as harmful, but at the time I believed that temporary damages were worth it if it meant keeping Trump from regaining power.

But over the past year, my view of Trump has evolved, and my view of the broader political landscape has also changed. It became clear to me that while Trump is far from perfect, he is not the true existential threat. The existential threat we face comes from the Democrat Party and Kamala Harris.

The Democrat Party is endangering the foundations that hold America together. This threat is multidimensional, but no concern is more immediate than the Democrats’ creation and defense of an immigration system that has completely abandoned integration and favors the interests of newcomers over those of the American people.

America is not merely a set of ideals. We are a nation — a distinct cultural and political entity. We are a people united by our history and traditions — bound together by an identity much weightier than the parchment on which our founding documents were inscribed.

In the past year, I came to realize that we are not just voting for the next four years; we are deciding what kind of country we want to live in for the rest of our lives. This is especially true for people my age. The America my peers and I will call home throughout adulthood — the America in which we will raise our families — is being shaped at this moment.

The radical immigration regime Americans are being subjected to represents not merely a shift in policy but a fundamental reconstruction of our nation. We are at a critical juncture where the values and cultural heritage that have defined us for generations are being subverted, and if we don’t act decisively, we risk losing the essence of what it means to be American.

Our defining customs, norms, and traditions — including our long-held belief in free speech — are eroding. Our cherished national character is being undermined by an immigration system that fails to protect and prioritize these foundational elements. Our way of life is being displaced in our homeland by an overwhelming influx of migrants who, in the truest sense, are foreign. The sheer volume of new arrivals makes the challenge of instilling a shared sense of identity and belonging nearly insurmountable.

We need to face this reality. Current immigration trends are unsustainable. Untold millions of migrants — receiving ever-increasing coddling from an ever-expanding welfare state and subjected to ever-decreasing assimilatory pressures — constitute a foundational problem for the nation.

Instead of fostering unity, we are creating a fractured society. People are retreating into enclaves, separated by language, culture, and values, with a diminishing sense of shared national identity. The immigration policies imposed on our country in recent years must not only be halted immediately, but decisive action must be taken to reverse their effects. Otherwise, we risk solidifying our decline into a fragmented population, unable to sustain the cohesion necessary for our survival as a unified people.

If we allow this cultural disintegration to continue, we are heading toward a future in which America ceases to exist in a meaningful capacity. Even if the United States survives as a governmental entity, our country is on course to become a hollowed-out version of what it once was, with our collective future sacrificed to placate the left and its self-loathing.

This is why I’ve changed my mind about Donald Trump. He is not the perfect candidate, but he is the only candidate willing to confront the greatest danger we face: irreversible damage to our cultural and political fabric caused by the reckless immigration policies of the Democrats, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.

We cannot afford to be shortsighted. A year ago, it would have been unthinkable for me to say this, but in 2024, I’m supporting Donald Trump — not because I endorse all that he says or does, but because he’s the only one willing to take decisive action to preserve America’s future.

Former President Donald Trump traveled to Las Vegas on Thursday evening for a Turning Point Action rally where he declared that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is "imploding" in a speech that focused on his tax cut plans.

"[Harris is] actually imploding, if you take a look. Because, look, I'm not supposed to say it, but we are leading by so much," Trump said Thursday evening in Las Vegas to cheers from the crowd.

"Now, we're leading by a lot in Nevada. We're leading by a lot in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Even states that are typically never in play for 50, 60, 70 years … But the fact is that states, other states too, big states, are all in play and they like us. But you know what? They think she is grossly incompetent. Let's face it, she is not doing well," Trump continued.

The 45th president joined the Turning Point Action rally at an arena on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' campus, where supporters such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also addressed the crowd. Trump said during the rally that 29,000 people were inside the arena, and another "29,000 outside to fill the place up twice."

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP WIN WOULD BE 'CATASTROPHIC' FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT FIRST TERM TELLS DIFFERENT TALE

Nevada is another key battleground state, and where Trump first announced earlier in the campaign cycle that he would eliminate taxes on tips. He again focused his Thursday speech on tax cuts, slamming the Biden-Harris for spiraling inflation while criticizing Harris for also saying she would end taxes on tips after Trump’s June announcement.

"When I said no tax on tips, remember? A month later, she comes out, 'and we will have no tax on tips.’ She never said that. And she's never said it again. You're not going to get it," he said.

"We're going to have no tax on tips. And she wanted to increase, and did increase, the so-called tip allocation tax rate by 60%. She raised your tax, and then she's supposed to say ‘no, no tax on tips.’ In other words, even after Kamala wrecked your economy with inflation, she came after you with tip income. Like sort of like a vulture would do. If she gets four more years, Kamala Harris will pick your pockets bare," Trump said.

Trump told the crowd that if he wins next month, he will eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and on Social Security benefits, and took a poll during the rally, asking supporters to cheer for which of the three tax cut plans they like the best.

Cheers and applause broke out as he rattled off the three options, with Trump declaring that seniors’ support for no tax on Social Security benefits received the most support.

The 45th president also railed against the Biden-Harris administration’s border policies, slammed alleged Democratic efforts to turn the U.S. military "woke," and vowed to work to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine as president-elect if he is victorious on Nov. 5.

"Sadly, zero chance that Putin would have gone into Ukraine if I were president. Zero chance. What a shame that is. All of the death," Trump said of the war that broke out when Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022.

Trump said he will call both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the evening of Nov. 5 if he wins.

TRUMP PROMISES TO END TAXATION OF OVERTIME PAY: 'YOUR OVERTIME HOURS WILL BE TAX-FREE'

"On the evening of Nov. 5, I will call Putin. I will call Zelenskyy. I'll say, ‘we got to stop it.’ And I'm going to try and get it done as president-elect, as president-elect. That'll give me plenty of, that'll give me plenty of credibility. I don't have to wait until January 20th. I'm going to try and get it done sooner than that. It's horrible," Trump said, adding that the war in Israel also would not have happened if he were in office.

Trump also hearkened back to his days on "The Apprentice," calling on the battleground state voters to tell Harris on Nov. 5, "You're fired."

"Nevada, you have to stand up, and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. She's the worst vice president. She's grossly incompetent. Kamala, Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here. Fired, fired! Get out. Get the hell out of here. We got to fix our country," Trump said.
Mint Sandstorm, the suspected Iranian state hackers who stole a trove of emails from several of former President Donald Trump’s campaign staffers this spring, reportedly succeeded in getting some of the pilfered documents published this fall, Reuters reported Friday.

Reuters reported that Democrat operatives and an independent reporter published some of the emails beginning late last month, after Reuters and several other mainstream media outlets passed on them.

Mint Sandstorm, also known as “Phosphorus” or Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 42 to cybersecurity researchers, is a hacking group that targets Iranian dissidents, journalists, academic institutions, and government agencies in countries that oppose the Iranian regime, including the United States and Israel.

The group, which is thought to be linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been known to use computer viruses, ransomware, and phishing techniques in its attacks.

In January 2024, Microsoft security researchers detected a major Mint Sandstorm campaign against research institutions and universities focused on Middle Eastern issues.

Microsoft Threat Intelligence described the hackers as “patient and highly skilled social engineers” who invested a great deal of effort in crafting realistic phishing emails, often contriving a means to send them from “legitimate accounts belonging to known people who the group’s victims would be familiar with and likely trust.”

Phishing is the art of using fake emails to trick victims into revealing passwords and other security information, or installing viral code on their computers. Mint Sandstorm was unusually patient and methodical with its phishing campaign against universities, often sending its victims a few harmless fake emails to build trust before hitting them with a phishing attack. Their preferred phishing technique was to trick their victims into downloading a file that would give the hackers backdoor access into their computer systems.

Between May and June of 2024, Mint Sandstorm evidently waged a similar campaign against staffers with Trump’s campaign. The hackers stole data from the email accounts of these staffers, including some documents involved in vetting his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), along with other potential running mates Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND).

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed the attack in September and promised to file criminal charges against the perpetrators. Three Iranian nationals named Masoud Jalili, Seeyed Ali Aghamiri, and Yasar Balaghi were indicted on 18 criminal counts in late September, including wire fraud, identity theft, and providing material support to the IRGC, which is a designated terrorist organization.

According to the indictment, the three hackers worked for the Basij, a brutal Iranian militia overseen by the IRGC.

When announcing the indictments, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the hackers attempted to pass some of their stolen material to the re-election campaign of President Joe Biden, who was replaced as the 2024 Democrat candidate by Vice President Kamala Harris in July. A Harris spokesperson claimed her campaign refused to use stolen Trump material that was sent to it and claimed hackers targeted several of her staffers, as well.

“We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity,” Harris spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said in September.

The hackers also reportedly tried to peddle their wares to Democrat-aligned major media outlets in July, including Reuters, Politico, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. The hackers assured these outlets their stolen email data would be highly damaging to the Trump campaign.

All of these outlets said they refused to accept the material, either because they did not want to do business with hackers or because the material they offered was not “newsworthy” enough. Reuters reported the hackers’ email addresses to Yahoo, which shuttered the email accounts and worked with the FBI to track the hackers down.

The Iranian hackers finally found takers for their material in a North Carolina-based group of Democrat operatives called American Muckrakers, according to Reuters, which began publishing the stolen Trump campaign emails on September 26. The group, which has a history of trying to dig up dirt on Republican candidates, reportedly pleaded with an alias used by the terrorist-linked hackers to send them more files.

American Muckrakers refused to disclose more information about its source for the emails, or to comment on if the FBI warned it not to accept material from the hackers.

Some of Mint Sandstorm’s stolen documents were also published by an independent reporter named Ken Klipperstein, who said the FBI did contact him after he communicated with the hackers, warning him not to deal with a “foreign malign influence operation.” Klipperstein published the emails anyway, deeming them “newsworthy.”

The Iranian mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Wednesday denying any attempt to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.

“Already devoid of any credibility and legitimacy, such allegations are fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible. The Islamic Republic of Iran does not engage in the internal uproars or electoral controversies of the United States,” the statement said.

“The continued perpetuation of such unfounded claims will only serve to undermine their credibility,” the statement added.
As the 2024 US presidential election cycle heats up, energy policy is shaping up to be a critical issue in seven key battleground states. Nearly 9 in 10 voters in these states want candidates to address how they plan to tackle rising energy costs, inflation, and America’s broader energy strategy.

But this isn’t just about oil prices at home or renewable energy targets—it’s about how the US positions itself on the global stage, particularly as Europe faces an industrial crisis that could redefine America’s geopolitical strategy.

The health of Europe’s industrial base, weakened by energy shortages and high costs, is increasingly intertwined with America’s security interests, and how the next US president navigates this will have far-reaching consequences.

Sanctions aimed at weakening Russia’s war economy have exposed Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. In 2021, Russia supplied close to half of Europe’s gas, but by 2023, that dropped to 8%. It may be celebrated as a strategic win against Russia, yet Europe now faces a severe energy shortage, and the impact on the continent’s industries has been catastrophic.

Germany, the EU’s economic engine, is facing a 7% decline in industrial output this year. Legacy heavy industries, once the backbone of Europe’s economy, are at risk of collapse. With renewable energy transitions moving too slowly to fill the gap, Europe urgently needs new energy partners to revive its industries and ensure its competitiveness.

The United Arab Emirates’ latest $16 billion acquisition of Covestro, one of Germany’s largest chemical companies, offers a glimpse of how foreign investments can stabilize Europe’s industrial sector.

Covestro, which produces materials essential to the automotive, construction, and electronics industries, plays a key role in Germany’s economy, contributing approximately 5% to its GDP. As part of the UAE’s broader strategy, the country is poised to invest $150 billion by 2027 across sectors, including energy and industry, positioning itself as a vital economic player.

Through the Covestro deal, the UAE offers more than financial capital; it provides a lifeline for a sector strained by energy shortages. The UAE’s mix of a sustainability-driven ethos and bold investment strategy comes at a crucial time for Europe, which is struggling to meet ambitious climate goals without disrupting its legacy industries. Such partnerships signal that Gulf countries are emerging as crucial energy and investment partners for Europe’s future.

These kinds of investments represent the global partnerships the U.S. should be actively facilitating to bolster its allies and ensure that Europe’s industries don’t collapse under the weight of energy shortages. America’s strategic interests demand that it not only encourage but support these partnerships.

The stakes are not just economic but geopolitical. The U.S. faces mounting challenges, particularly from China’s expanding influence and Russia’s destabilizing aggression. By stabilizing Europe’s economic base through investments, European competitiveness can be reinforced, easing America’s burden and allowing Washington to focus its strategic resources where they matter most—countering China’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.

Moreover, the U.S. must recognize the risks posed by China’s aggressive trade practices, particularly in critical sectors like its electric vehicle (EV) production. Gulf investments in Germany, along with AESC’s recent $1 billion investment for a gigafactory in France, can help Europe compete, reducing reliance on Chinese imports. These initiatives offer the U.S. a dual opportunity to not only support its economic allies but also reinforce its goal of countering China’s influence globally.

Such partnerships also reduce America’s military and economic commitments to Europe, allowing Washington to pivot toward other pressing challenges, such as Beijing’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea and Russia’s growing footprint across Africa.

As the 2024 election nears, American voters must recognize that global energy markets are intertwined, and even with progress toward energy independence, global shifts will impact the U.S. economy and foreign policy. Whether choosing an isolationist, “America First”-er, or internationalist approach, these fluctuations will affect Americans. A stable Europe, supported by investments, can help shield the U.S. from energy shocks, safeguarding both economic stability and strategic interests.

Supporting international partnerships isn’t just foreign policy—it’s an investment in America’s prosperity. No matter the electoral outcome, the next administration will need to navigate these global dynamics to protect national interests.

Public polls missed badly in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, but pollsters are not convinced that 2024’s surveys will end up being accurate, according to several who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

In 2016 and 2020, public polls generally failed to sufficiently account for non-college educated white voters, a demographic that forms a key pillar of former President Donald Trump’s base. While most pollsters are making an effort to not undercount those hard-to-reach Trump supporters in 2024, properly forecasting the breakdown of the electorate that ultimately turns out to vote remains a difficult task given the limitations of polling techniques for surveying groups like young men and non-college educated Americans, multiple pollsters told the DCNF.

“The single biggest mistake was under-counting non-college voters. It used to be that when we undercounted non-college voters, we were sort of unintentionally putting a thumb on the scale for Republicans, because Republican voters used to be more college-educated, they tended to be wealthier, so an undercount of non-college voters meant that you were essentially over-sampling Republicans and under-sampling Democrats,” Jon McHenry, a GOP pollster, told the DCNF. “Now that’s sort of flipped, so that’s one part of it, is that a lot of the polls in 2016 and 2020 were undercounting non-college voters. The lower-quality media polls that are done online are still getting more college-educated voters than non-college-educated voters.” (RELATED: It’s Not Very Difficult To Understand Why Trump Is So Popular Among Men)

University of Virginia Center for Politics Director Larry Sabato suggested that pollsters are not sure if they are accurately gauging Trump’s support during an appearance on CNN earlier in October.

Ultimately, reaching and properly weighing this slice of the electorate remains a major challenge for public polls — which are typically of lower quality than the private internal polls commissioned by campaigns — forecasting how things will shake out in 2024. Currently, the RealClearPolitics polling average, which combines many national polls into a single metric, shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead by 0.6 percentage points nationally with Trump maintaining comparably thin leads in all of the seven swing states.

In the 2016 election, pollsters accurately predicted that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would win the national popular vote by a relatively wide margin, but they underestimated Trump’s support from lower-education and working-class white people in crucial states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which most polls incorrectly predicted Clinton would win, according to a November 2016 assessment published by Pew Research Center. Then, in 2020, it was “clear that Trump’s strength was not fully accounted for in many, if not most, polls,” according to Pew, and that President Joe Biden’s expected electoral and popular vote victories turned out to be much narrower than widely projected, according to the American Association for Public Opinion Research’s evaluation of the 2020 cycle’s public polling.

“I don’t think that the campaigns are making those mistakes again,” McHenry told the DCNF, referencing misleading internal polling of campaigns past. “As you look at, say, the poll tracker at The New York Times, they’ve got firms in there that I’ve never heard of, and that doesn’t mean that they’re not good, but it means that we should be suspicious. Do they have a good track record? How are they conducting their polls? Is it just an easy online panel that’s convenient to them, versus a more robust attempt to make sure that people are accurately represented?”

Robert Cahaly, a senior strategist and pollster for the Trafalgar Group, says he thinks the “hidden” Trump vote that pollsters have struggled to capture in elections past remains a real phenomenon in 2024. Trafalgar was one of the most accurate polling outfits for the 2020 presidential race, though “they didn’t get a lot of credit for it because they happened to ‘call’ some of the close states wrong,” according to polling expert Nate Silver.

“I think what we’re seeing is a higher degree of hidden Trump vote in 2024 than we saw in 2016. The highest degree in 2024, second-highest in 2016 and the lowest hidden vote in 2020,” Cahaly told the DCNF. “For one, it’s hard to get Republicans to take surveys, and secondly, getting them to give you a real answer when they do take one is also tough, because many Republicans default to ‘undecided.'”

However, Democrats have robust voter mobilization infrastructure in place in must-win swing states, meaning that whatever “hidden” Trump vote may exist may be met by higher-than-anticipated turnout for Harris, according to Cahaly.

Moreover, the methods of sampling for public polls — and even private polling for lower-stakes campaigns — are typically not as thorough or expensive as internal polling for a presidential race, according to John McLaughlin, a pollster for the Trump Campaign.

“Oftentimes, media polls and lower campaign polls, they can’t afford the expense of the higher quality poll. So, what they do is random calling, they do robocalls which skew to landlines and don’t have enough younger people on them, they don’t use live interviewers. They use random online databases, but we love to center people who take calls,” McLaughlin told the DCNF. “So the sampling is cheaper, but it’s prone to error, and there are more people voting early now. It gets harder and harder to get through to voters and ask them how they’re voting.”

“The only way to account for the previous bias in 2016 and 2020 is that they were letting the overall media bias affect their polling operations,” McLaughlin added. “The evidence that the polls are better now is that the Left is complaining that they’re too good for Trump.”

McLaughlin pointed to an October 2020 Washington Post-ABC News poll that showed Biden enjoying a 17-point lead over Trump in Wisconsin, a state that Biden only won by less than 1%, as a clear example of politicized polling.

Celinda Lake, an experienced Democratic pollster, has her own views about the challenges of public polling and the factors that may make it less reliable than the private internal polls campaigns use for strategic purposes.

“I think the hardest thing in the polling is to figure out the turnout,” Lake told the DCNF. “What’s the Trump surge going to be? Is there a Harris surge? What will it be?”

“It isn’t so much the quiet Trump voter, it’s the Trump voter who is not in our universe. So for example, if you’re looking at likely voters, if you look at the voters who registered in 2020 but did not vote, they lean Trump,” Lake continued. “Well, they would often not be in people’s turnout models. So it isn’t that people are quiet about their support, and like past years, Trump is encouraging his supporters to be vocal about their support. It’s more that surge voters are not in the universe because they don’t have voting history.”

Many pollsters are running different turnout models to inform their findings, meaning that they run polls with different underlying assumptions about what slices of the electorate will show up to vote and in what numbers to assess several different scenarios, Lake told the DCNF. Another problem with public polls is that the media often reads too far into them when they report on the latest figures, in Lake’s view.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Thursday broke down how either Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican nominee Donald Trump could win in a “blowout” victory, despite the polls showing a historically close race.

Whoever wins the 2024 election has a 60% chance of securing over 300 electoral votes and a 40% chance of winning less than that, despite the polls being very close, Enten said. Harris could possibly secure 319 electoral votes if she wins all seven key battleground states, while Trump would win 312 electoral votes if the results in those states go in his favor.

“If you look across the 7 key swing states, the 7 closest states, in all of them, the margin right now is under 2 points,” Enten said. “But keep in mind, polling ain’t perfect, my dear friends,” Enten said. “On average, since 1972 in the battleground states, the average error in the key swing states is 3.4 points. So if all of the battleground states all go in one direction, you could end up with a map like this for Kamala Harris where she wins all the key battleground states, including North Carolina, wins Georgia, wins Arizona, wins Nevada, she gets to 319. That’s even better than Biden did.”

“But, it could go in the other direction whereby Trump wins all the key Great Lake battleground states, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada and he gets to 312 electoral votes,” Enten continued. ”



Both Harris and Trump’s possible results would be better than President Joe Biden or the former president did when they won in the 2016 and 2020 elections, Enten said. (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says ‘Trump Wins The Election In A Blowout’ If ‘We Have A Polling Miss Like We Had In 2020’)

Polling errors in all of the swing states have historically moved in one candidate’s favor in past elections, with the polls underestimating former President Barack Obama by 92% in 2012 and Trump by 83% in 2016 and 100% in 2020, Enten said.

“So this time around, don’t be surprised if the swing state polls, when they underestimate one candidate, they underestimate all of them in the states and that would lead to a relatively Electoral College blowout with one of the candidates winning at least 300 electoral votes,” Enten said.

A new poll published by the Wall Street Journal found Trump leading Harris nationally 47% to 45%. The former president also held a 0.8 point lead against Harris across every swing state as of Friday, according to RealClear polling averages.

U.S. intelligence officials appear “clueless” about an alleged campaign money-laundering scheme on behalf of Democrat candidates now the subject of several lawsuits and soon lawmaker subpoenas, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson tells The Federalist.

For the better part of the past two years, the Wisconsin Republican has been raising alarm bells about alleged “smurfing” activities through ActBlue, Democrats’ online donation platform that has taken in millions of dollars for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. As Johnson notes in a recent column in The Daily Caller, the practice appears to involve hundreds, even thousands, of low-dollar donations made in the names of individuals without their knowledge. Some suspect the money is coming from wealthy foreign actors looking to affect U.S. elections — especially next month’s presidential election.

As Just the News first reported, Wisconsin conservative strategist Mark Block, who claims he’s a victim of the alleged scheme, names ActBlue in a recent racketeering lawsuit charging that unnamed participants have violated the Wisconsin Organized Control Act.

‘Straw Donations’

On Thursday, Johnson and fellow Badger State Republican Rep. Bryan Steil sent letters to the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) seeking a classified briefing on “potential election interference through fraudulent donations by foreign actors.”

Johnson, ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and Steil, chairman of the House Administration Committee, requested Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to ActBlue. They also requested that all three agencies provide classified briefings on the matter.

Steil’s committee has been investigating claims that “foreign actors, primarily from Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and China, may be using ActBlue to launder illicit money into U.S. political campaigns. Our investigation has indicated that these actors may be exploiting existing U.S. donors by making straw donations without their knowledge,” the letter states.

The investigations have uncovered evidence “pointing to” illegal donations broken up into smaller amounts to get around legal contribution limits, according to the letter. Steil has warned of the use of prepaid debit, credit, and gift cards employed in the names of legitimate donors “to make straw donations that are virtually impossible to detect.” In one case, the lawmakers note, 5,776 donations were made totaling $754,124.

‘Turning a Blind Eye’

So far, it’s been radio silence, Johnson said.

“We haven’t heard a word from them,” the senator told The Federalist in an interview Wednesday. He’s not confident the committees will hear back from the same agencies that feverishly worked to silence the Hunter Biden laptop story as “Russian interference” days before the 2020 election — a real disinformation campaign.

Johnson said he first wrote to the Federal Election Commission about his concerns in April 2023 following an O’Keefe Media Group video tracking alleged incidents of smurfing. He said the FEC has refused to confirm or deny whether it’s investigating the alleged campaign finance law violations.

“I keep hearing they don’t have the ability to investigate,” the senator said. “These federal agencies are turning a complete blind eye to what I consider clear-cut violations of campaign finance laws.”

As Johnson noted in his recent Daily Caller op-ed, intelligence directors seem obtuse about the growing number of red flags around the suspect mass donations through ActBlue. The senator noted an “All Members Classified Briefing on Foreign Threats to U.S. Elections” in late September, led by Avril Haines, director of National Intelligence, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly.

The presentation included “absolutely nothing about the most egregious examples of election interference in our lifetime, or the most significant threats to the integrity of the 2024 election,” Johnson wrote. He said the FBI’s Wray “seemed clueless” on the ActBlue issue “and had no idea if the FBI was doing anything to investigate it.”

‘Pattern of Racketeering Activity’

Mark Block, who served as chief of staff for 2012 GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain, has filed what New York Post columnist Miranda Devine describes as a “bombshell racketeering lawsuit” in Wisconsin’s Waukesha County Circuit Court.

Block alleges that his personal identifying information was “fraudulently used” to make more than 385 small campaign donations of more than $884 to 62 campaigns and political organizations — 35 of which went to the Harris Victory Fund. The contributions, averaging $3.24 per transaction, fit into a federal election law loophole that doesn’t require campaigns to itemize donations from contributors when the total amount is less than $200, the lawsuit notes.

“Campaigns that receive contributions below $200 can simply bundle the donation into a list of un-itemized contributions,” the complaint in Block v. John Doe states.

Within a day of Harris moving to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, the vice president reportedly raked in $81 million from nearly 890,000 grassroots donors. By the end of the month, the campaign boasted $310 million in total donations. That breaks records for daily and weekly totals. Block challenges the campaign’s claim it was all “grassroots energy and enthusiasm” driving the massive haul.

In his lawsuit, Block alleges that in May, ActBlue began sending receipts to an old email address he used. ActBlue stated that donations had been made in the name of “Bernie Cain,” a pseudonym he had previously used, Block claims. The conservative says he didn’t “make, authorize or consent” to any of the contributions to leftist candidates. He includes a spreadsheet detailing each of the ActBlue donations ostensibly made using his personal information.

“Of these donations, 86 were initiated as one-time donations, 234 were set up as donations recurring on a weekly basis, and 65 recur on a monthly basis,” the complaint states. The donations list a UPS mailbox located in Santa Monica, Calif. Block claims he is not connected in any way with the credit card used for the donations and has never authorized its use to make donations through his Cain accounts.

The complaint alleges multiple felonies, including the fraudulent use of personally identifiable information and identity theft. The lawsuit claims the alleged perpetrators have violated the Wisconsin Organized Crime Control Act, meeting the “pattern of racketeering activity” and “enterprise” requirements under the statute.

“By making these fraudulent donations, John Doe associated with ActBlue in pursuit of a common goal: funding Democratic campaigns and organizations to advance left-leaning policies,” states the complaint, which seeks an injunction and damages.

‘I Certainly Intend to Pursue This’

Attorneys general in Texas, Virginia, Wyoming, and elsewhere have raised concerns about the potential for foreign donors and other bad actors to use the conduit to interfere with U.S. elections.

As Johnson and Steil note in their letter to the intelligence heads, the House Administration Committee a year ago sent a letter to ActBlue asking how the platform blocks contributions from foreign sources. ActBlue acknowledged that it did not require contributors to provide their card verification value (CVV) code when making an online contribution to a Democrat campaign. That lapse, which ActBlue says it has fixed, “may have allowed foreign actors to fraudulently participate in the political process in the U.S.”

A House Administration Committee data analysis, comparing more than 200 million FEC donation records with data on age, party affiliation, and other information, found “several anomalies and mismatches in the FEC records, suggesting that foreign entities may be using these tactics to interfere with U.S. elections,” according to the lawmakers.

Steil has introduced the Secure Handling of Internet Electronic Donations (SHIELD) Act that would “prohibit political committees like ActBlue from accepting online contributions from debit or credit cards without the disclosure of the CVV and billing address associated with the card.” It would also bar contributions from gift cards, prepaid credit or debit cards, or gift certificates.

ActBlue officials did not return The Federalist’s request for comment, but the nonprofit has criticized what it sees as “partisan political” attacks and scare tactics to “undermine the power of Democratic and progressive small-dollar donors.” An ActBlue official recently told the Hill, “[W]e are aware of recent attempts to spread misinformation about our platform.”

While Biden-Harris administration intelligence officials may stonewall congressional investigations, Johnson said that will change if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House and Republicans hold the House and take back the Senate.

“I certainly intend to pursue this,” the senator told The Federalist. “I will be issuing subpoenas, if Bryan Steil doesn’t beat me to the punch.”

Political commentator Tucker Carlson warmed up the crowd Wednesday at a rally for former President Donald Trump in Duluth, Georgia, warning Democrats that “dad” is coming home.

Carlson delivered an impassioned rebuke of the Democratic Party, telling Trump supporters in the room that they are the American majority rather than a hated minority.

He ripped Democrats who support tearing down statues and allowing illegal migrants to pour into the U.S., declaring that the majority of America will tolerate this no more.

“They went out of their way to humiliate and spit on you and the graves of your ancestors,” a fiery Carlson said in his speech.

Carlson said Trump, who he likened to a father coming home from work, would give the Biden-Harris administration a “spanking” if he wins the 2024 election.

“If you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to, like, slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re gonna get more of it. And those kids are gonna end up in rehab!” Carlson explained. “It’s not good for you and it’s not good for them.”

“There has to be a point at which dad comes home,” he stated as the crowd erupted in a standing ovation. “Yeah, that’s right! Dad comes home. And he’s pissed!”

Carlson said while “dad” is actually not pissed and still loves his children, “dad” is greatly disappointed in his children and must let them know.

“And when dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking,'” Carlson said.

CNN’s Brian Stelter reported that the crowd shouted, “Daddy’s home” and “daddy Don,” as Trump took the stage.

After Tucker Carlson likened Trump to “daddy” tonight, and said a reelected Trump would need to give the media and Democrats a “spanking,” the rally crowd “went wild,” @alaynatreene reports.

Other speakers at Trump’s Turning Point USA event included former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii — who announced Tuesday she is officially a registered Republican — and former Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RELATED: From #MeToo To #NotYou: Where Are All The Feminist Celebrities On Emhoff?)

Carlson said “normal” Americans are on the side of Trump, while envious and hateful “weirdos” prop up “the Democratic machine.”

“To allow millions of people, mostly young men with no skills and no English, into our country illegally and then fly them around at our expense and give them phones and put them on welfare programs that American citizen can get. It is the most insulting-” Carson said, causing the audience to boo the Biden-Harris administration’s role in the border crisis.

“Yeah, boo. But it’s worse than boo,” he remarked. “It’s the biggest crime in the history of the United States of America.”
There’s a popular conception that politicians at the federal level, especially the leaders of the major parties, must possess a high degree of cunning and intellect. After all, only the most Machiavellian schemers could navigate the cutthroat labyrinth of party politics to the highest offices in the Capitol or the White House, right?

Oftentimes, people strain, sometimes desperately, to attribute complex machinations and ulterior motives to the current chaos of the American political landscape. It’s part of a senseless hope that there is some deeper meaning to be found in the inane ramblings or narcissistic posturing of our political class.

National Review’s Jim Geraghty displayed this sentiment Monday, seemingly struggling to make sense of Kamala Harris’ rise to power and the very real possibility that she could be the next president despite the mountain of evidence that she is, indeed, a simpleton.

“There’s this nagging complication — if Kamala Harris is as stupid as her critics claim, why does she have the Democratic presidential nomination and a roughly 50–50 shot of being the first female president in U.S. history?” Geraghty posted on X.

There’s this nagging complication — if Kamala Harris is as stupid as her critics claim, why does she have the Democratic presidential nomination and a roughly 50–50 shot of being the first female president in U.S. history? Do you know how many ruthlessly ambitious Democratic men… — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) October 21, 2024

“Do you know how many ruthlessly ambitious Democratic men and women have desperately yearned to get where she is? How many smart, tough, shrewd, often underhanded and cold-blooded pols have tried to claw their way up the greasy pole and fallen short? And somehow this supposed dunce managed to do it?” he continued.

Geraghty is overthinking it. In reality, the vast majority of Washington denizens are merely average, and more than a few are complete buffoons.

Case in point: Kamala Harris. She might actually be one of the most intellectually feeble people to seek the presidency. When she tried to claim the nomination on her own, in 2020, she ran one of the most amateurish campaigns in a primary already chocked full of imbeciles. She was so hopelessly inept as the “border czar” that the propaganda press tried to memory-hole the fact that she held the position.

On the campaign trail in 2024, she has become the queen of word salads and non-answers, only capable of parroting the most vapid talking points. None of her nonsensical words of “wisdom” ring more hollow than the oft-repeated “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” Truly the mantra of mental midgets everywhere.

Most recently, she’s now accused of multiple instances of plagiarism, including in congressional testimony — truly a signifier of a sharp and adept mind.

So, to address Geraghty’s question: How did Kamala reach the highest levels of the Democrat Party?

First off, she became then-candidate Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 for a very specific reason, and it was not her intelligence. The Democrat Party then handed her the nomination on a silver platter, without a single primary vote in her favor, after the soft coup against an obviously declining Biden.

Second, it’s sad to admit, but a large portion of the population is stupid enough or deranged enough to support Harris. There are more than enough people willing to cast a vote for her based on her race or her gender, the fact that a “D” appears next to her name on the ballot, or the obvious reality that she is not Donald Trump.

Third, plenty of mediocre (at best) or even outright moronic people have bumbled their way into the halls of power in this country — far more than we’d like to admit given our “enlightened” form of government. Some men more suited to serving as the White House janitor have wound up in the Oval Office because they were pawns in larger political intrigues, were at the right place at the right time, or were the least bad option.

The Democrat Party nominated Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan in 1852 and 1856, respectively, by passing over arguably the most famous and accomplished Democrat of the era, Stephen Douglas. Franklin Pierce remains one of the most forgettable presidents, and Buchanan has become infamous for his disastrous handling of the secession crisis on the eve of the Civil War.

Infighting and intrigues caused in large part by President Woodrow Wilson saw the Democrat Party of the Roaring Twenties nominate a succession of candidates in 1920, 1924, and 1928 that evinced an electoral strategy akin to “meh, good enough.” These men found themselves leading one of the major national parties not because they inspired voters or had any real chance of overcoming the Republicans’ strong economic record, but more due to the fact someone had to be nominated.

Sometimes people rise to power based on events entirely out of their control, even sheer dumb luck. Both candidates in the 1976 presidential election could thank the fallout from Watergate for their moment in the national spotlight.

Gerald Ford was catapulted to the presidency after corruption scandals rocked the Nixon administration. Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in October 1973, paving the way for Ford to become President Richard Nixon’s No. 2; then the Watergate scandal pushed Nixon out of office.

Jimmy Carter was a virtual unknown outside his home state of Georgia before the 1976 election, but the anti-establishment feeling in the nation in the wake of Watergate suddenly made the dark horse the most viable candidate in a stable of Washington swamp creatures.

Ford, while apparently an affable man, is mostly known as a moderate, placeholder president burdened by the baggage of his predecessor and the ultimate defeat in Vietnam. Though Carter somewhat rehabilitated his image post-presidency, his tenure in office saw economic turmoil at home and humiliation for the U.S. abroad in the Iran hostage crisis.

All this to say, just because someone serves in public office or rises to party leadership does not mean that person possesses any special guile or wit. Perhaps if she wins, Harris will reveal herself as a political genius who was patiently playing the fool to deceive her enemies, but more likely she’ll continue to reveal what she really is: a dolt with a small talent for opportunism.

Sometimes, a spade is a spade. Sometimes, an idiot is an idiot. Kamala most likely isn’t playing 4-D chess. She’s struggling at checkers.

With early voting underway in several states as Election Day closes in, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are making their final pitch to voters in critical swing states like Georgia.

Many Black men, however, remain torn about the 2024 race, particularly when it comes to the candidates' personalities and top issues like the economy.

"Kamala hasn't presented a plan yet on what she's going to do. All she's talked about is what she's going to give people," a voter at FADEOLOGIST 3 barbershop in the Atlanta area told "Fox & Friends" co-host Lawrence Jones. "She's going to give people all this stuff. We're going to give you a $25,000 tax credit to buy a house... It don't matter if you give these people $25,000, they're not going to buy a house. They're not going to do it."

"Everybody wants something for free. That's what the Democrats think. If we give you something, you'll vote for us. I don't need a handout. I need an opportunity."

TRUMP, HARRIS NECK AND NECK AS DEMS LOSE GROUND AMONG LATINO, BLACK VOTERS: POLL

Harris has struggled to retain support from Black male voters. According to a recent survey by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, 73.8% of Black voters would support Harris compared to 87% in favor of President Biden in 2020.

The same poll also found Trump leading Harris by four points in the Peach State.

While one voter argued the country and Atlanta community are in "disarray," neither Trump nor Harris has emerged a clear victor in Georgia.

"I'm gonna support Trump... He gave us four years of peace and prosperity, a secure border, no new wars," a voter sporting a MAGA hat said. "One of the biggest things that speaks to me as a business owner is the border. I mean, inflation, we have more dollars chasing less goods. And an invasion also is another form of inflation because we have more people that are needing less products."

"They want to pick the best candidate that allows them to work for themselves," one barber told Jones. "A lot of times you have people like my guy right here who's looking for an opportunity to start his own business. And he's telling me, what president would actually help me the best? So I'm telling him, I think Kamala."

Another man said he has seen "more people leaning towards Kamala Harris" despite criticism of her time with the Biden administration.

Jones also heard from an Atlanta resident who had voted for the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020, but now "my pockets hurt. I don't want my pockets hurting."

"It's not about the person. I've never fallen in love with a personality. If you look at my history of voting, even this most current one, it's not down the line blue all the time. It's not all red. It's a mixture," he added.

Although the economy has proven to be a top issue for voters nationwide, another Georgia local said "the number one issue I say facing Black America is the trust."

"The trust of Washington, D.C. The inflation is crazy high right now. Interest rates are up, and we just don't believe what's in office right now is going to support us another four years."

As the clock counts down to November 5, all eyes are on the swing states as Harris and Trump make their final play in the race for the White House.
With the November election approaching, much attention is focused on the presidential contest — but at least as significant are the contests that will determine who controls Congress.

That is because Congress controls federal taxing and spending.

“The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States,” says the Constitution. (RELATED:PAUL TELLER: Republicans Shouldn’t Shy Away From A Spending Fight)

“No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law,” it says.

In his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, published in 1833 and quoted on The Founders’ Constitution website, Justice Joseph Story did an excellent job explaining the purpose of this provision.

“The object is apparent upon the slightest examination,” wrote Story. “As all the taxes raised from the people, as well as the revenues arising from other sources, are to be applied to the discharge of the expenses, and debts, and other engagements of the government, it is highly proper, that congress should possess the power to decide, how and when any money should be applied for these purposes.

“If it were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation; and might apply all its monied resources at his pleasure,” he wrote.

“In arbitrary governments the prince levies what money he pleases from his subjects, disposes of it, as he thinks proper, and is beyond responsibility or reproof,” Story wrote. “It is wise to interpose, in a republic, every restraint, by which the public treasure, the common fund of all, should be applied, with unshrinking honesty to such objects, as legitimately belong to the common defence, and the general welfare.”

How has Congress handled this responsibility in recent decades?

In 1994, when Congress faced the midterm election in President Bill Clinton’s first term, Republicans were competing with a Democratic Party that had won control of the House in every election since 1954. In late September 1994, then-House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich led Republican House members and candidates in making what they called their “Contract With America.”

“The contract is a list of tried-and-true GOP agenda items, including welfare reform, tax cuts, term limits and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution — a list calculated to have maximum voter appeal,” reported the Associated Press.

It did. Republicans won control of both the House and Senate that year.

On Jan. 26, 1995, House Republicans brought up the proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget.

This proposed amendment, said its official summary, “Prohibits total outlays from exceeding total receipts for a fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the members of each House of Congress provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote.”

It also: “Sets a permanent limit on the amount of the public debt. Prohibits an increase in such amount unless approved by a three-fifths majority in each House by roll call vote.”

And: “Directs the President to submit a balanced budget.”

Then-House Majority Leader Dick Armey gave a floor speech explaining why this amendment was needed.

“Each and every one of our children today is endowed with $18,300 of federal national debt,” said Armey.

“This moment,” he said, “stands at a time where, if we do nothing, we must face the even more frightening possibility that by the time of their young adulthood, they will have even worse of that indebtedness, and their children, too, will share it.”

Armey was right — and large majorities in both houses of Congress agreed with him.

The House voted 300 to 132 that day to approve the Balanced Budget Amendment. The 228 Republicans who voted for it were joined by 72 Democrats — giving it the necessary two-thirds vote to move forward.

So, it went to the Senate — where on March 2, 1995, one Republican defector stopped it from being sent to the states for ratification. That was Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, who, according to his biography on the Senate website, “cast the lone Republican ‘nay’ vote on a GOP-supported Balanced Budget Amendment, which ultimately fell one vote short of passage.”

On that day when Hatfield blocked the Balanced Budget Amendment, the federal debt was $4,851,006,718,917.40, according to the Treasury Department’s “Debt to the Penny” webpage. As of Oct. 18 of this year, it was $35,769,732,147,503.35.

That is a greater-than-sevenfold increase in less than 30 years.

According to the 2020 Census, there were 73,106,000 individuals in the United States under the age of 18. The $35,769,732,147,503.35 in federal debt equals approximately $489,286 per each one of these young Americans.

Under the Biden-Harris administration — working with a Congress in which Republicans controlled the House and Democrats the Senate — the federal government spent $6,751,552,000,000 in fiscal year 2024, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement for September. At the same time, it collected $4,918,736,000,000 in taxes and ran a deficit of $1,832,816,000,000.

The $6,751,552,000,000 the federal government spent in fiscal 2024 was up $2,304,941,000,000 — or 51.8% — from the $4,446,611,000,000 it spent in the pre-COVID year of fiscal 2019.

What comes next? “For the 2025-2034 period, CBO now projects that if current laws generally remained unchanged, the cumulative deficit would be $22.1 trillion,” said a Congressional Budget Office report released in June.

America needs a Congress that will stop this.

Vice President Kamala Harris stood outside the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C., launching a blistering attack on former President Trump, her rival in the 2024 White House race.

Harris charged that the former president was "increasingly unhinged and unstable" as she pointed to critical comments made by retired Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s former White House Chief of Staff, in a New York Times interview.

The vice president argued Trump was a "fascist" as she noted Kelly's allegations that the then-president repeatedly voiced admiration for Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler.

Hours later, at a CNN town hall in battleground Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, Harris doubled down on her charges.

NEW NATIONAL POLL SHOWS WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE FINAL STRETCH

Asked if she believed the Republican presidential nominee was a fascist, the vice president answered "yes, I do."

And she emphasized that American voters "care about our democracy and not having a President of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist."

Trump, who has vehemently denied Kelly's allegations, took to social media to fire back at Harris, arguing that her criticisms were a sign that she's losing the election.

The former president claimed that Harris was "increasingly raising her rhetoric, going so far as to call me Adolf Hitler, and anything else that comes to her warped mind."

If Harris' criticisms that Trump is "unfit to serve" in the Oval Office sound familiar, there's a good reason – they are.

As he ran for re-election, President Biden made his argument that Trump was an existential threat to democracy a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.

Biden spotlighted what he called the former president's "assault on democracy" – as he pointed to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election victory - during a January speech as he kicked off the election year.

As he continued to run for another four years in the White House, the president repeatedly argued that Trump was "a threat to democracy."

But after a besieged Biden in July dropped his re-election bid and backed Harris to replace him atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, the vice president and her advisers seemed to discard the Biden playbook on Trump.

Instead, "joyful warrior" Harris spotlighted a more upbeat message and when she focused on Trump, she noted his petty grievances and called him an "unserious man," as she argued during her Democratic National Convention address in late August.

But as the calendar moved from summer to autumn, and Election Day neared, in a margin-of-error race where plenty of polls suggest the momentum belongs to Trump, there's been an apparent shift of tone coming from the vice president and her campaign.

"Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself," Harris charged last week during multiple campaign rallies in battleground Wisconsin.

According to a senior campaign official, Harris will deliver what's being described as a major "closing argument" address next Tuesday - one week until Election Day - on the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.

The campaign spotlighted that Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021. Many of those who attended Trump's rally then marched to the U.S. Capital and joined other protesters in storming the building. The campaign sees the Ellipse as a symbolic location that they believe will help make clear to voters the choice in the presidential election.

The contrast with the former president that Harris is working to sketch comes as she and her campaign make a full court press to attract dissatisfied Republicans who supported Trump rival Nikki Haley earlier this year in the GOP presidential primaries.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS INDICATE IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

While Trump continues to hold massive sway over the Republican Party, even a sliver of GOP voters casting ballots for Harris could make a difference in some of the battleground states in a race likely to be decided in the margins.

Harris in recent weeks has teamed up in the key battleground states with high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, including former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.

A Democratic strategist in Biden's political orbit told Fox News that the shift in Harris' messaging is a sign that the president was right to repeatedly take aim at Trump on the campaign trail as an existential threat to democracy.

The Trump campaign argues that the new messaging will backfire with voters.

"Kamala Harris is focused on Donald Trump and President Donald J. Trump is focused on the American people," Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez argued on "Fox and Friends" on Thursday. "Our closing argument is so different than theirs. They are throwing everything they can at the wall to see what sticks because Kamala Harris is floundering."

Longtime vocal GOP Trump-critic Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire - who was a top Haley supporter and surrogate in the Republican nomination battle but says he'll vote for Trump - said that the attacks wouldn't succeed in courting voters.

"You're dealing with an individual who makes outrageous statements all the time," Sununu said of Trump during an interview on Fox News' "Your World with Neil Cavuto." "They're baked into the noise."

Sununu argued that "the reason the Harris campaign has completely frozen, lost all their momentum, is because all they do is talk about crazy things that Trump says and does."

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, agreed.

"Voters have been hearing versions of this overheated rhetoric for the better part of the last decade, and they’re starting to tune it out as background noise," he told Fox News Digital.

Reed also noted that the new criticism comes after Trump survived two assassination attempts against his life this summer, and many of the former president's allies blame rhetoric from some Democrats for fueling the toxic political climate.

"It’s especially ironic coming from the Biden-Harris Administration that ran on an idea of unity, and are now demonizing someone who has been subject to multiple attempts on his life," noted Reed, who supported vocal Trump critic former Gov. Chris Christie this cycle.

But Reed said "the bigger challenge is that life was easier under the previous presidency than the current one. Prices were lower, the border more secure and ‘inflation’ was an esoteric term from an economics class and not a headache of everyday life. The Harris campaign has failed to lay out their vision and positive plans to address these issues, leaving them with no choice but to focus solely on the negatives around Trump and hope for the best."

He called it "a risky bet when voters are looking for concrete solutions to real problems."

Even some Democrats have issues with the new messaging.

"I worry that the threat to democracy message rings hollow with the majority of voters who are much more focused on improving their own personal situation and want to vote for someone who will make their life more affordable," seasoned Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital.

Moyer said that "if I were the Harris campaign, I would continue to hammer home through Election Day the message of what Harris will do for these voters to lower costs and help them get ahead. In doing so, she will be speaking to the top priority across multiple subsets of the electorate. Voters who have the luxury of worrying about the broad concern of the fate of democracy are most likely already voting for Harris."
"The View" co-hosts grew visibly frustrated by voters who were still unconvinced to support Vice President Kamala Harris in the tight 2024 race, with Joy Behar admitting she was having a "breakdown" from the anxiety over the election outcome.

The co-hosts discussed Harris' town hall in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, where she spoke to undecided voters. After playing a clip of one voter criticizing both candidates' rhetoric, Behar lashed out.

"Get off the fence, all right?" she said. "It’s a presidential candidate with credentials versus some kind of a nutcase. That’s what you are up against. Stop with the fence already, I’m sick of it. I can’t take this anymore."

"You see I’m having a breakdown. I can’t wait for Election Day, so I can sleep at night!" she added with a groan.

LA TIMES EDITOR RESIGNS OVER THE PAPER NOT ENDORSING HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT: ‘NOT OKAY WITH US BEING SILENT’

Behar said there needed to be a "blue tsunami" in order to win the race by a large margin.

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg also criticized swing voters who were hesitant to support Harris.

"If you’re not sure now, I don’t know what else it is people are looking for. She has turned herself inside out practically," Goldberg said of Harris' uptick in sitting for media interviews over the past several weeks.

"She’s doing the best she can with what she’s got, and if it’s not good enough, then we’re in trouble," Goldberg fretted.

Earlier in the program, co-host Sunny Hostin claimed that Harris was being held to a "different standard" than former President Trump was being held to.

CNN PANEL CRITICAL OF KAMALA HARRIS' TOWN HALL PERFORMANCE: ‘WORD SALAD CITY’

"She is being held to a different standard. She has to be perfect while he has been the most imperfect candidate we have ever seen for presidency in our lifetimes. That is just a fact," she stated.

"That is a fact. And, you know, her criticism – the criticism she’s getting is she’s too scripted. I say she’s disciplined. I want someone who is disciplined near the nuclear codes. I want someone who is moderate near the nuclear codes, and so all this criticism that she’s getting makes it very clear to me that not only is it a binary choice, people are holding her to this different standard, because you have a maniac on the other side," she continued.

Behar agreed. "He doesn't even have to appear sane, that's the bar at this point. She has to appear presidential," she said.

CNN commentators were critical of Harris' answers during her town hall on Wednesday, suggesting the vice president gave "word salad" responses when she didn't want to answer a question.

"The thing that would concern me is when she doesn’t want to answer a question," former Obama adviser David Axelrod said. "Her habit is to kind of go to word salad city, and she did that on a couple of answers. One was on Israel. Anderson [Cooper] asked a direct question, ‘Would you be stronger on Israel than Trump?’ And there was a seven-minute answer, but none of it related to the question he was asking."

Axelrod also said Harris made a "mistake" when answering questions about the Biden-Harris administration's border policies.

Harris said she believed the administration did "the right thing" by waiting until 2024 to take executive action to curb illegal immigration.

Fox News' Hanna Panreck contributed to this article.
Vice President Kamala Harris joined CNN in Pennsylvania for a town hall with undecided voters on Wednesday, where the Democratic presidential nominee doubled down on her rhetoric comparing former President Donald Trump to Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler.

"If the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, 'Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?' Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong-Un," Harris said of Trump on Wednesday evening in a town hall moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper.

Earlier Wednesday, former Trump administration chief of staff John Kelly claimed to the media that Trump praised "Hitler's generals" for their loyalty. Harris posted on X that Trump is "out for unchecked power" before also comparing Trump to the Nazi dictator.

"Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution," Harris posted to X earlier Wednesday. "He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses."

HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON 'FASCIST' COMMENTS AT START OF CNN TOWN HALL: 'UNSTABLE'

Cooper pressed Harris about the rhetoric in his first question to the Democratic nominee on Wednesday evening, sparking Harris to double down and also say she believes that Trump is a "fascist."

"You quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You, yourself, have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?" Cooper asked Harris towards the start of the town hall.

"Yes, I do. Yes, I do," Harris responded.

Harris' comments come after Trump survived two assassination attempts on his life since July. Trump has blamed the attacks on heated rhetoric from Democrats.

HARRIS LIKENS TRUMP TO HITLER IN SCATHING REMARKS, SAYS HE WANTS SAME MILITARY LOYALTY AS GERMAN DICTATOR

Harris spoke directly to the undecided battleground state voters during the live town hall Wednesday, including telling one voter that if she wins on Nov. 5, her administration will be different than Biden's.

"Considering you've been in the position of vice president for the past four years under the Biden administration, how can we expect you to deviate from the direction of that administration compared to your own? How can we differentiate your policy and your beliefs from that of Biden's?" the audience member asked Harris.

Harris, who has previously said while on the campaign trail that she couldn't think of anything she would have done differently from Biden, said Wednesday that her administration would be different than Biden's leadership.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: NEW NATIONAL POLL SHOWS WHO HAS THE EDGE 2 WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY

"First of all, my administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues, and believe that we have to actually take new approaches," Harris said.

"For example, what we talked about in terms of housing. My experience that leads to that priority, includes what I did to take on the big banks around the foreclosure crisis. When I brought billions of dollars to homeowners that were the subject of predatory lending. I know what homeownership means to the American people, not to mention what it meant to my mother, who worked very hard and saved up, so that by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home."

The town hall event kicked off at 9 pm on Wednesday from Chester Township, which is located less than 20 miles outside of Philadelphia. The event was held after CNN proposed holding a third presidential debate -- including Biden's first debate before dropping out of the race -- on Oct. 23. Harris accepted the invite and Trump declined, leading to the town hall.

HARRIS STUMBLES ON THE BORDER WHEN PRESSED ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: 'IS A BORDER WALL STUPID?'

Harris was also pressed about her border and immigration policies, including a bipartisan bill that would provide funding for a border wall that Harris previously lambasted as a "stupid" idea when promoted by Trump during his administration.

"Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ‘stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.’ Is a border wall stupid?," Cooper asked Harris.

"Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall," Harris said while laughing. "So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know, where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built."

"But you agreed to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall," Cooper pressed.

"I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system," Harris responded.

"We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes, like, let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. Why is there any ideological perspective on this? Let's just fix the problem," she continued, adding that non-citizens need to "earn" citizenship.

"So you don't think it's stupid anymore?" Cooper continued.

"I think what he did and how he did it was, did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything," she responded.

HOSPITAL THAT DELAYED EMERGENCY ABORTION BEARS BLAME FOR GEORGIA WOMAN’S DEATH, FAMILY’S LAWYER CLAIMS

Pennsylvania is a key state again this election, with both Harris and Trump vying to win the state to clear the path to an overall victory. Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

Harris leaned into her support of abortion during the town hall, claiming that red state abortion policies have led to women's deaths. The Harris campaign and Democrats have previously claimed that at least two women in Georgia died due to "restrictive" abortion laws, with OB-GYNs subsequently criticizing the narrative as a misleading story pushed by the media.

JIMMY KIMMEL NOT 'MENTALLY PREPARED' FOR KAMALA HARRIS TO POTENTIALLY LOSE THE ELECTION

"Trump abortion bans, some that make no exception, even for rape or incest. One of the areas I specialized in as a prosecutor was crimes against women and children. The idea you would tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. This is what's happening in our country. You all may have heard the stories. Women have died. Women have died because of these laws and the suffering," Harris said.

Harris called for the end of the filibuster last month in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide, which was slammed by lawmakers and conservatives as an attack on democracy. The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

Cooper pressed Harris on the matter Wednesday, asking: "You've talked about codifying Roe v Wade. That would require 60 votes in the Senate, a majority of the House. That's a big, that's a big leap. We don't have that yet. If that's not possible to codify it in the House, what do you do?"

Harris responded that it was time to revisit the filibuster.

"I think we need to take a look at the filibuster, to be honest with you. But the reality of it is this, let's talk about how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade," she said. "And they did as he intended. And now, in 20 states, we have abortion bans."

Harris' appearance unfolded as the Wall Street Journal published a new poll finding Trump in the lead nationally, at 47% support to Harris' 45%.
Pro-life groups are livid at Vice President Kamala Harris after she took an uncompromising position on abortion rights at odds with many faith-based health care providers.

Harris told NBC's Hallie Jackson on Tuesday that she does not support religious exemptions for abortion and would not make any concessions on that issue, if elected, under a potentially divided government.

"I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body," Harris said in the interview.

Christian and pro-life leaders said her position is hostile toward believing doctors and Catholic hospitals, who view abortion as the sinful taking of innocent life. They questioned whether she would respect constitutional protections for religious Americans if she wins the presidency.

HARRIS REFUSES TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO REPUBLICANS ON ANY ABORTION LEGISLATION, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS

"Kamala Harris' comments here show that she believes the First Amendment no longer applies to people of faith, including Catholics," said Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

"She is setting the stage to put Catholic doctors in jail, to strip medical licenses from Catholic physicians and to shut down Catholic health care as we know it."

Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, a senior fellow with The Catholic Association, said Harris "should clarify, and quickly, whether given the chance she would force Americans who object on religious or conscience grounds, to participate in abortion."

"Sadly, it would not be the first time Harris has used her political power to trample the rights of religious Americans," she added.

HARRIS CLAIMS SHE WAS ‘HONEST WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE’ ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL ACUITY: ‘CAPABLE IN EVERY WAY’

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from Christians and pro-life groups for filing lawsuits against activists who prayed outside of abortion clinics under the Freedom of Access to Clinical Entrances Act. Activist Lauren Handy, with Citizens for a Pro-Life Society, was handed a nearly five-year prison sentence in May for organizing one such protest outside a clinic in Washington, D.C., in 2020.

CatholicVote and others have accused the Biden-Harris administration of "weaponizing" the Justice Department against abortion opponents. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

In interviews, Harris has refused to say whether there is any restriction on abortion that she supports. When Jackson repeatedly pressed her on whether there were any compromises she might support to pass legislation to expand abortion access, Harris refused to "engage in hypotheticals."

"Let's start with the fundamental fact. A basic freedom has been taken from the women of America, the freedom to make decisions about their own body. And that cannot be negotiable, which is that we need to put back in the protections of Roe v Wade, and that is it," Harris said.

KAMALA HARRIS AVOIDS QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE: ‘JOE BIDEN IS NOT ON THE BALLOT’

The vice president has supported legislation in Congress that would codify the Supreme Court's now defunct opinion in Roe v. Wade, which would guarantee federal protections for abortion access and override nearly all abortion restrictions enacted by pro-life lawmakers at the state level nationwide.

William Wolfe, founder and executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership, said Harris' position makes "crystal clear" that "Christians are not welcome in the modern, pro-abortion Democrat Party."

"Frankly, I'm not surprised to learn that a Kamala administration would shred the First Amendment and force Christian doctors and hospitals to provide abortions because ‘expanding abortion access’ is a key tenant of their progressive ‘religion.’ There is nothing that the Democrats value more than the ‘freedom’ to end innocent, pre-born human life in the womb with no legal restrictions or repercussions," said Wolfe.

"Her fanatical commitment to abortion access and disregard for the First Amendment isn't a bug – it's a feature of her platform. I fail to see how any Christian can support such a barbaric and unconstitutional candidate in good faith."

Public opinion polls show, and political analysts agree, that the 2024 presidential election is on a trajectory to be one of the closest in decades. Seven battleground states will determine the winner, and those states are expected to be decided by slim margins – where support from significant voter blocks, like Catholics, could very well make the difference.

"The Catholic vote will be critical, as it has been in every election over the last 40 years," said Burch.

"The Democratic Party has gone from safe, legal and rare to now let's force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions, or we'll throw you in jail. That's quite the shift, and I think voters recognize this as a bridge too far."

Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of The Family Leader, an Iowa-based socially conservative group, said he has "never seen an election that represents a bigger contrast of worldview" than the 2024 presidential contest.

"You can't tell a doctor my so-called ‘right’ to abortion trumps your right of conscience, so I can force you to commit what you believe is murder. That's not the America I grew up in, not the America our Founders would have ever permitted, but that's the Kamala Harris America," he said.

"The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the guarantee of religious liberty, is on the ballot. Choose well, America."

Harris will travel to Texas on Friday, a state her campaign has called "ground zero of Trump's abortion bans." She will attend an event in Houston with women "who have faced the direct impacts of these extreme laws" and will speak about the "harm Donald Trump's abortion bans have caused across the nation."
Iran's military forces will get a large influx of cash thanks to a booming energy economy, despite Western sanctions.

The regime's upcoming 2025 budget will triple the amount of oil revenue allocated to its armed forces.

As tensions with Israel and by proxy the U.S. reach a fever pitch, the government expects next year to take in $26 billion from oil exports, 37.5% of its total revenue. Half of that amount, around $13 billion, will be directed toward military spending, according to a report on the budget by Iran International.

Officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces, they consist of the Army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF).

The other 42.5% will go toward the government’s operating budget, with 6.5% earmarked for "special projects."

This year’s Iranian armed forces have a total budget of $17 billion, including $4.5 billion from oil revenues. The budget does not say how much money the military will get from other sources next year.

Around 95% of the nation’s oil exports go to China, which buys it at a discounted rate due to the liability of skirting sanctions. In total, the government projects the nation in total, including non-governmental entities, will bring in $69 billion from oil and gas exports, around $5 billion of that from domestic energy sales.

IRAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD OFFICIAL CHARGED IN PLOT TO KILL IRANIAN AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST IN NYC

The budget reveals that Iran expects to increase daily exports by 350,000 barrels, bringing the total to some 3.75 million barrels per day next year. Iran has no plans to build new oil refineries, so the entire increase is intended for export.

Republicans have long criticized the Biden administration for "turning a blind eye" to illicit oil and gas sales and refusing to enforce sanctions, which they say enriched Iran to fund its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah to attack Israel and the Houthis to attack Western trade routes.

Despite U.S. sanctions, Iran has been able to export near-record amounts of oil, around 1.7 million barrels per day.

After the Trump administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, it imposed harsh sanctions on the regime to stop its funding of proxies abroad, banning U.S. citizens from trading with Iran or handling Iranian money.

It also punished entities in other countries that did business with Iran by cutting them off from the dollar.

INTELLIGENCE REPORT SAYS IRAN WILL KEEP TRYING TO KILL TRUMP REGARDLESS OF ELECTION OUTCOME

President Biden often waived enforcement of such sanctions, keen to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and fearful of driving up global oil prices.

Iran gained access to more than $10 billion through a State Department sanctions waiver that allowed Iraq to continue buying energy from Iran, which the Biden administration argues is necessary to keep lights on in Baghdad.

White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby has insisted none of the funds go to the IRGC or Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but are "for humanitarian goods."

Earlier this month, the Energy Information Agency published a report finding Iran sold $144 billion in oil abroad between 2021 and 2023. Under a maximum pressure period in 2020, Iranian oil sales had decreased to $16 billion.

In the first half of 2024, Iran had already brought in $24 billion from oil exports.

On Friday, the U.S. hit Iran with fresh sanctions on its so-called shadow fleet of ships circumventing sanctions to sell Iranian oil in response to the missile attack on Israel at the start of the month.
Vice President Kamala Harris stood outside the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C., launching a blistering attack on former President Trump, her rival in the 2024 White House race.

Harris charged that the former president was "increasingly unhinged and unstable" as she pointed to critical comments made by retired Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s former White House Chief of Staff, in a New York Times interview.

The vice president argued Trump was a "fascist" as she noted Kelly's allegations that the then-president repeatedly voiced admiration for Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler.

Hours later, at a CNN town hall in battleground Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, Harris doubled down on her charges.

NEW NATIONAL POLL SHOWS WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE FINAL STRETCH

Asked if she believed the Republican presidential nominee was a fascist, the vice president answered "yes, I do."

And she emphasized that American voters "care about our democracy and not having a President of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist."

Trump, who has vehemently denied Kelly's allegations, took to social media to fire back at Harris, arguing that her criticisms were a sign that she's losing the election.

The former president claimed that Harris was "increasingly raising her rhetoric, going so far as to call me Adolf Hitler, and anything else that comes to her warped mind."

If Harris' criticisms that Trump is "unfit to serve" in the Oval Office sound familiar, there's a good reason – they are.

As he ran for re-election, President Biden made his argument that Trump was an existential threat to democracy a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.

Biden spotlighted what he called the former president's "assault on democracy" – as he pointed to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election victory - during a January speech as he kicked off the election year.

As he continued to run for another four years in the White House, the president repeatedly argued that Trump was "a threat to democracy."

But after a besieged Biden in July dropped his re-election bid and backed Harris to replace him atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, the vice president and her advisers seemed to discard the Biden playbook on Trump.

Instead, "joyful warrior" Harris spotlighted a more upbeat message and when she focused on Trump, she noted his petty grievances and called him an "unserious man," as she argued during her Democratic National Convention address in late August.

But as the calendar moved from summer to autumn, and Election Day neared, in a margin-of-error race where plenty of polls suggest the momentum belongs to Trump, there's been an apparent shift of tone coming from the vice president and her campaign.

"Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and will stop at nothing to claim unchecked power for himself," Harris charged last week during multiple campaign rallies in battleground Wisconsin.

According to a senior campaign official, Harris will deliver what's being described as a major "closing argument" address next Tuesday - one week until Election Day - on the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.

The campaign spotlighted that Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021. Many of those who attended Trump's rally then marched to the U.S. Capital and joined other protesters in storming the building. The campaign sees the Ellipse as a symbolic location that they believe will help make clear to voters the choice in the presidential election.

The contrast with the former president that Harris is working to sketch comes as she and her campaign make a full court press to attract dissatisfied Republicans who supported Trump rival Nikki Haley earlier this year in the GOP presidential primaries.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS INDICATE IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

While Trump continues to hold massive sway over the Republican Party, even a sliver of GOP voters casting ballots for Harris could make a difference in some of the battleground states in a race likely to be decided in the margins.

Harris in recent weeks has teamed up in the key battleground states with high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, including former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.

A Democratic strategist in Biden's political orbit told Fox News that the shift in Harris' messaging is a sign that the president was right to repeatedly take aim at Trump on the campaign trail as an existential threat to democracy.

The Trump campaign argues that the new messaging will backfire with voters.

"Kamala Harris is focused on Donald Trump and President Donald J. Trump is focused on the American people," Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez argued on "Fox and Friends" on Thursday. "Our closing argument is so different than theirs. They are throwing everything they can at the wall to see what sticks because Kamala Harris is floundering."

Longtime vocal GOP Trump-critic Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire - who was a top Haley supporter and surrogate in the Republican nomination battle but says he'll vote for Trump - said that the attacks wouldn't succeed in courting voters.

"You're dealing with an individual who makes outrageous statements all the time," Sununu said of Trump during an interview on Fox News' "Your World with Neil Cavuto." "They're baked into the noise."

Sununu argued that "the reason the Harris campaign has completely frozen, lost all their momentum, is because all they do is talk about crazy things that Trump says and does."

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, agreed.

"Voters have been hearing versions of this overheated rhetoric for the better part of the last decade, and they’re starting to tune it out as background noise," he told Fox News Digital.

Reed also noted that the new criticism comes after Trump survived two assassination attempts against his life this summer, and many of the former president's allies blame rhetoric from some Democrats for fueling the toxic political climate.

"It’s especially ironic coming from the Biden-Harris Administration that ran on an idea of unity, and are now demonizing someone who has been subject to multiple attempts on his life," noted Reed, who supported vocal Trump critic former Gov. Chris Christie this cycle.

But Reed said "the bigger challenge is that life was easier under the previous presidency than the current one. Prices were lower, the border more secure and ‘inflation’ was an esoteric term from an economics class and not a headache of everyday life. The Harris campaign has failed to lay out their vision and positive plans to address these issues, leaving them with no choice but to focus solely on the negatives around Trump and hope for the best."

He called it "a risky bet when voters are looking for concrete solutions to real problems."

Even some Democrats have issues with the new messaging.

"I worry that the threat to democracy message rings hollow with the majority of voters who are much more focused on improving their own personal situation and want to vote for someone who will make their life more affordable," seasoned Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital.

Moyer said that "if I were the Harris campaign, I would continue to hammer home through Election Day the message of what Harris will do for these voters to lower costs and help them get ahead. In doing so, she will be speaking to the top priority across multiple subsets of the electorate. Voters who have the luxury of worrying about the broad concern of the fate of democracy are most likely already voting for Harris."
Energy industry leaders are pushing for Vice President Kamala Harris to clarify her stance on fossil fuel production in the final days of the presidential race, citing fears that she would restrict production and add on to four years of confusing policy under President Biden.

These concerns reached a fever pitch last week after senior campaign climate adviser Camila Thorndike said in an interview that Harris has no plans to promote fracking in office. The remarks, since walked back, sparked backlash and criticism from Republicans and industry groups, who re-upped their calls for clarity from the vice president.

Many viewed the now-retracted comment as a sign she would crack down on fracking. This could cost Harris big time in Pennsylvania – the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer behind Texas, and a key swing state with 19 electoral votes out for offer in the presidential race.

Harris did little to assuage voters in her town hall event Wednesday night. She denied that she had previously endorsed a fracking ban while seeking the presidency in 2019 – when she said there was "no question" she is in favor of banning fracking – and instead pointed to her recent endorsement of the practice.

She has also repeatedly noted her tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, or the Democratic-led legislation that opened new lease sales for fracking.

BIDEN SEEKS TO CEMENT LEGACY ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN REMAINING MONTHS AS PRESIDENT

However, even in the Keystone State, gas groups remain skeptical as industry leaders note that with just days left before the election, Harris has done little to spell out how she would lead on oil and gas issues, especially when it comes to issues of fracking – a necessary technology to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania.

Instead, one statewide industry group said, her remarks have only inspired "more fracking confusion."

Harris "was against it before she was for it. Or is it the other way around now?" a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Energy Infrastructure Alliance quipped of Harris's fracking flip-flops in a blog post Wednesday.

Harris "continues to give mixed messages about her position on fracking – an issue central to voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania," a spokesperson for Grow America’s Infrastructure Now Coalition told Fox News in a statement.

While Harris has said she would "not ban fracking," the group said, "there is a distinct difference between not banning fracking, and promoting energy production."

KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE VOTER REGISTRATION DATA SHOWS INFLUENTIAL SHIFTS FAVORING GOP

"As the Harris campaign travels through Pennsylvania … it remains to be seen whether she will clarify her position," they added.

Winning Pennsylvania may require an embrace of fossil fuel production. The state is the second-largest natural gas producer in the U.S. and boasts a gas industry that supports more than 120,000 state jobs and adds roughly $41 billion annually to the state's economy.

"It's obvious that the pathway to the presidency goes through Pennsylvania," Amanda Eversole, the chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute, told Fox News earlier this month.

Bigger picture

Harris, to date, has ignored calls to clarify her exact policy positions on energy production, which was a heated topic during the Biden administration.

Her recent stump speeches in Pennsylvania have leaned heavily on the historic levels of U.S. oil and gas production reached under President Biden – despite the fact that this production was in large part a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels," Harris said in recent campaign remarks.

The U.S. Oil and Gas Association described Harris's view on social media as the latest "change in her prior, prior, position."

BIDEN SEEKS TO CEMENT LEGACY ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN REMAINING MONTHS AS PRESIDENT

Republicans also used it to seize on their wins in Pennsylvania, where Democrats have struggled to gain momentum in recent weeks-- including both Harris and down-ballot candidates, such as Sen. Bob Casey.

When asked for a comment Wednesday, a spokesperson for former President Donald Trump's campaign seized on Thorndike's recent remarks, telling Fox News in a statement that they only "cement the reality" that "the only candidate in this race who will unleash Pennsylvania energy to cut utility bills and fuel American growth is [Trump]."

Former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also criticized the interview and the confusion swirling around Harris's policy positions so close to Election Day.

"With the election less than 2 weeks out, the recent comments from Harris’ climate director are concerning," Perry told Fox News in a statement.

"Calling the oil and gas industry ‘ecoterrorists’ is insulting to the millions of energy workers across the country, and the Vice President should disavow these extreme comments," he said. "Voters from PA, OH, and WI should believe Vice President Harris the first time she vowed to ban fracking."

‘Quiet Amnesty’ Danger Highlighted in New House Report

Nearly 1 million illegal immigrants are staying in the U.S. "indefinitely" after their cases were dismissed or closed, or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to file the necessary documentation, according to a new House Judiciary Committee report released Thursday taking aim at a "sort of quiet amnesty has become a staple of the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration courts."

"Through administrative maneuvering at both the Justice Department and DHS, the Biden-Harris Administration has already ensured that nearly 1 million illegal aliens can remain in the United States without the possibility of deportation—and that trend shows no sign of stopping," the report by the House majority on the committee, first obtained by Fox News Digital, says.

When illegal immigrants are encountered, they can be put into removal proceedings by which they will eventually face an immigration judge to have their case decided. There are around 700 immigration judges across the U.S., and they currently face a backlog of millions of cases after the historic crisis at the border. …Read more

'ONE OF THE DUMBEST POLITICAL DECISIONS': Texas politicos launch full court press against Harris ahead of her border state campaign rally: 'apologize'…Read more
FIRST ON FOX: More than a dozen Texas Republicans, from the governor to members of the U.S. House, slammed Vice President Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border state Friday, telling Fox News Digital the visit is "one of the dumbest political decisions" they've seen.

"'Border Czar' Kamala Harris can come all the way to Houston where Jocelyn Nungaray was killed by Tren de Aragua gang members that she let into the country, yet she can't be bothered to visit Jocelyn's family or even say her name. Kamala Harris and her open border policies have allowed over 11 million illegal immigrants and dangerous criminals like TdA into our country, putting every American's life at risk," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Fox News Digital.

"President Donald Trump has shown real leadership on the border, with successful border policies that decreased illegal immigration to the lowest level in decades. While Kamala Harris refuses to take real action on this crisis, Texas will continue to step up with our historic border mission until we have a partner in the White House to make America secure again."

Harris will travel to the red state just 10 days ahead of Election Day, and she is expected to speak about the state's abortion policies after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Abortion is a hallmark of the Harris campaign, including Harris saying she supports eliminating the filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide.

I’m glad she is spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state with only a few days left in the election. I hope she stays longer. Donald Trump is going to be the next president because the voters are fed up with the Harris-Biden regime and the chaos they’ve created," Patrick said.

Harris will be joined by Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who is making a long-shot run to unseat longtime Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

Cruz slammed his Senate opponent in comments to Fox Digital, saying Allred and Harris share the same "radical policies."

"Colin Allred is Kamala Harris. They have spent the last four years working hand-in-hand against Texans and the American people with their radical policies, whether those be pushing to allow boys in girls' sports, allowing dangerous illegal aliens to come into our country or trying to destroy the oil and gas industry in Texas," Cruz said.

As illegal immigration spiraled in 2021, the Biden-Harris administration’s first year in office, President Biden announced Harris would lead the effort to determine the "root causes" of immigration. The administration pointed to issues such as climate change, poverty and violence driving migrants to the U.S.

The media and Republicans dubbed Harris the "border czar" shortly after, with the White House rejecting the title. The moniker, however, has continued years later, including Texas Republicans this week using it to slam Harris ahead of her visit.

"Millions of migrants have illegally entered our country on Border Czar Kamala Harris’ watch, so it’s no surprise that she’d rather talk about anything but her abysmal track record on the border. If she can’t control the border, how can she run the country? We’ve never had a more secure border than under President Trump, and he will put a stop to this when he takes office. Nov. 5 can’t come soon enough," Texas Sen. John Cornyn said.

"Harris’ last-ditch effort to appear serious on border security is more than laughable, it’s dangerous. If she were serious, she would’ve acted as a legitimate ‘Border Czar.’ Instead, she imported over 20 million illegals into our communities where they're rewarded with government benefits, leaving U.S. citizens to be raped and murdered by violent illegal criminals," Rep. Ronny Jackson said.

"Harris admitted that she’s pro-mass amnesty and has gone so far as to support taxpayer-funded transition surgeries for detained illegals. She is the ultimate panderer, and, if elected, will continue her open-border policies. Texans, including our incredible Latino community, do not trust her, which is why they’re projected to turn out in record numbers to vote for Trump."

Nineteen Texas leaders submitted comments to Fox News Digital slamming Harris’ planned visit, with a handful citing girls and women who have been murdered in recent years, allegedly at the hands of illegal immigrants.

"Harris should visit Houston, but not to campaign. She should come to apologize for purposefully allowing Texas border counties to be overrun and allowing young Houstonians like Jocelyn Nungaray to be murdered by the people she allowed in," Rep. Dan Crenshaw said.

Twelve-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted and murdered by strangulation when two illegal immigrants in their 20s allegedly lured the young girl under a bridge before killing her in June.

"Instead of coming to Texas to ask for our votes, Kamala should be asking for our forgiveness. Especially from the family of Jocelyn Nungaray and the countless others devastated by her administration’s open border policies. For four years, she has ignored Texans and the deadly crisis she has created at our southern border," Rep. Roger Williams said.

"Her negligence as Border Czar contributed to the tragic deaths of Americans, including Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed by two illegal aliens from Venezuela. Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously," Rep. Wesley Hunt added.

Harris’ event will kick off Friday evening in Houston, with reports surfacing that she will be joined by singer-songwriter Beyoncé, who is originally from Houston.

"If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws?" — Ken Paxton, Texas attorney general

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the Texas Republicans' comments on her upcoming visit. The campaign also did not respond to a request for confirmation regarding whether Beyoncé will join the rally.

Harris joined a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening outside Philadelphia, where moderator Anderson Cooper pressed the vice president about her border policies, including whether she supports a border wall after calling the wall "stupid" when it was championed by Trump during his administration.

"Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ‘stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.’ Is a border wall stupid?" Cooper asked Harris.

"Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall," Harris said while laughing. "So, remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built."

"But you agreed to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall," Cooper pressed.

"I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system," Harris responded.

"So you don't think it's stupid anymore?" Cooper continued.

"I think what [Trump] did and how he did it was… did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything," she responded.

"Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously." — Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton railed against Harris in comments to Fox Digital ahead of her visit, saying she and President Biden "intentionally dismantled every successful Trump border policy to let in as many aliens as possible" starting on their first day in office.

"Now, Kamala wants to come to Texas and talk about border security after four years of destroying American communities. If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws? We’re fighting Kamala’s destructive open-borders doctrine in the courts because she has unlawfully weaponized power to make our country more dangerous instead of keeping Americans safe," Paxton said.

"Now, Texas is fighting Kamala’s obvious effort to allow noncitizens to vote illegally in American elections. We need to end the insanity, secure the border, restore the rule of law and put American citizens first again by re-electing President Trump."
Vice President Kamala Harris stumbled through the Biden-Harris administration's border and immigration policies when pressed about the border crisis during a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper.

"Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times.

"I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system," Harris responded.

"We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes, like, let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. Why is there any ideological perspective on this? Let's just fix the problem," she continued.

"So you don't think it's stupid anymore?" Cooper continued.

"I think what he did and how he did it was, did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything," she responded.

Vice President Kamala Harris joined CNN for a town hall event Wednesday evening, speaking to Pennsylvania voters outside of Philadelphia. The town hall event kicked off at 9 pm on Wednesday from Chester Township, which is located less than 20 miles outside of Philadelphia.

Cooper asked Harris earlier in the town hall to explain why just weeks before the first presidential debate with President Biden was still in the race this summer, the administration instituted executive actions that curbed illegal border crossings and had not issued such orders sooner.

"You're exactly right, Anderson. And as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half. In fact, the numbers I saw most recently, illegal immigration," Harris told Cooper.

"If it was that easy without executive action, why not do it in 2022, 2023?" Cooper pressed.

"Because we were working with Congress and hoping that actually we could have a long term fix to the problem instead of a short-term fix," Harris responded.

"You couldn't have done one and both at the same time," Cooper noted.

Cooper went on to ask Harris if she wished she had "done those executive orders in 2022, 2023," sparking Harris to say she believes the administration "did the right thing."

"I think we did the right thing. And but the best thing that can happen for the American people, is that we have bipartisan work happening. And I pledge to you, that I will work across the aisle to fix this longstanding problem. I think the American people are demanding it, on both sides of the aisle," she responded.
Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down in her comparison of former President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler, saying at a CNN town hall that she believes Trump is a "fascist."

"Yes, I do, yes, I do," Harris told moderator Anderson Cooper when asked if she believes Trump is a "fascist."

Later in the discussion, Harris said Trump would ask US military leaders to be more like Hitler's. She also accused the former President of admiring dictators like Kim Jong-Un.

Harris joined CNN for a town hall event Wednesday evening, speaking to Pennsylvania voters outside of Philadelphia. The town hall event kicked off at 9 pm on Wednesday from Chester Township, which is located less than 20 miles outside of Philadelphia.

Cooper asked Harris about her social media post earlier Wednesday that compared Trump to Adolf Hitler at the start of the debate. Harris doubled down that she believes Trump is "unstable," but did not directly compare him to Hitler.

HARRIS LIKENS TRUMP TO HITLER IN SCATHING REMARKS, SAYS HE WANTS SAME MILITARY LOYALTY AS GERMAN DICTATOR

JIMMY KIMMEL NOT 'MENTALLY PREPARED' FOR KAMALA HARRIS TO POTENTIALLY LOSE THE ELECTION

"I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable and unfit to serve. And I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is the people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, his national security adviser, former secretary of defense and his vice president have all called him unfit and dangerous," Harris said.

Harris said on X earlier Wednesday that "Trump is out for unchecked power" and similar to the Nazi Germany dictator.

"He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution," Harris posted. "He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses."

Harris went on during the town hall to cite former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who claimed to the media on Tuesday that Trump wanted "Hitler's generals."

FAR FEWER NEWSPAPERS ARE ENDORSING HARRIS THAN BACKED CLINTON OR BIDEN

"And then today we learned that John Kelly, a four-star Marine general who is his longest serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently, in the last two weeks of this election, talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is. And I think one has to think about why would someone who served with him, who is not political, a four-star Marine general, why is he telling the American people now? And frankly, I think of it as is: He's just putting out a 911 call to the American people, understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House," she said.

Harris' and Kelly's comments come after Trump has faced two close assassination attempts amid heated rhetoric this election cycle.

Trump hit back on his social media site Truth Social following Harris and Kelly's remarks that Kelly "made up a story out of pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred."

"Thank you for your support against a total degenerate named John Kelly, who made up a story out of pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred! This guy had two qualities, which don’t work well together. He was tough and dumb. The problem is his toughness morphed into weakness, because he became JELLO with time!" he posted.

"The story about the Soldiers was A LIE, as are numerous other stories he told. Even though I shouldn’t be wasting my time with him, I always feel it’s necessary to hit back in pursuit of THE TRUTH. John Kelly is a LOWLIFE, and a bad General, whose advice in the White House I no longer sought, and told him to MOVE ON! His wife once told me, at Camp David, John admires you tremendously, and when he leaves the Military, he will only speak well of you. I said, Thank you!"

Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned former President Trump by name more than two dozen times during her CNN town hall on Wednesday, including when pressed about specific policies she would institute if elected to the White House.

Fox News found that during the CNN town hall in Chester, Pennsylvania, Harris mentioned Trump by name 26 times, while Trump was mentioned overall by moderator Anderson Cooper or audience members a total of 43 times. The CNN town hall kicked off at 9 p.m. on Wednesday and wrapped up around 10:15 p.m.

Harris was pressed on issues such as her border policies the last three and a half years as vice president, and how she would tackle immigration differently if she was elected president. At one point, Cooper pressed Harris on her support of a bipartisan bill that would provide funding for a border wall that she previously lambasted as a "stupid" idea when promoted by Trump during his administration.

"Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ‘stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.’ Is a border wall stupid?," Cooper asked Harris.

Harris pivoted from directly answering the question to citing Trump.

"Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall," Harris said while laughing. "So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know, where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built."

"So you don't think it's stupid anymore?" Cooper later asked.

"I think what he did and how he did it was, did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything," she responded, not citing Trump by name, but referring to his leadership as president.

At another point, Cooper asked Harris about her plans to tackle reported price gouging by corporations, with Harris answering that she "took this issue on" when she served as California attorney general before admonishing Trump for not attending the town hall. CNN held the town hall after proposing a second presidential debate between Harris and Trump for Oct. 23. Harris accepted the debate, but Trump declined, spurring the network to host a town hall instead.

"By the way, again, Donald Trump should be here tonight to talk with you and answer your questions. He's not, he refused to come. But understand that part of his plan is to put in place a national sales tax of at least 20% on everyday goods and necessities, and that, by economist estimates — independent economists — would cost you, as the American consumer and taxpayer, an additional $4,000 a year," Harris claimed.

Harris was also asked about codifying Roe v. Wade, which sparked the vice president to again attack Trump while signaling support to end the filibuster.

"You've talked about codifying Roe v Wade. That would require 60 votes in the Senate, a majority of the House. That's a big— that's a big leap. We don't have that yet. If that's not possible to codify it in the House, what do you do?" Cooper asked.

"I think we need to take a look at the filibuster, to be honest with you. But the reality of it is this, let's talk about how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade," she said. "And they did as he intended. And now, in 20 states, we have abortion bans."

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: NEW NATIONAL POLL SHOWS WHO HAS THE EDGE 2 WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY

Harris was directly asked about Trump a handful of times during the debate — with her answers included in the total count of 26 Trump mentions — most notably when Cooper asked her about an X post comparing Trump to Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler. Earlier Wednesday, former Trump administration chief of staff John Kelly claimed to the media that Trump praised "Hitler's generals" for their loyalty, which Harris repeated in an X post that day.

"If the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, 'Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?' Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong Un," Harris said at one point. She also told Cooper that she believes Trump is a "fascist."

HARRIS STUMBLES ON THE BORDER WHEN PRESSED ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: 'IS A BORDER WALL STUPID?'

Harris sat down last week for her first interview with Fox News since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Biden dropped out of the race in July amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity and age. During that interview, Harris cited Trump by name 23 times.

"More than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it's on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they're saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that?" Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier asked Harris during the interview. "If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years."

"And Donald Trump has been running for office since…" Harris responded, while Baier interjected, "But you've been the person holding the office."

At another point, Baier asked Harris: "Your campaign slogan is a ‘New way forward’ and ‘It’s time to turn the page.’ You’ve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?"

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

"Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up," Harris responded.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign regarding the vice president repeatedly citing Trump when asked about her policies, but did not immediately receive a reply.
Whatever happened to all the calls for civility and cooled-down political rhetoric in the wake of the two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump?

Wait, weren’t we supposed to come together as a nation, as Joe Biden and Kamala urged, to stop inspiring acts of political violence, especially during such a fraught election year? Harris said as much in September after a deranged pro-Ukraine fanatic, Ryan Routh, allegedly nearly took out Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf course.

“I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more to violence,” Harris said Sept. 15.

After the first attempt on Trump’s life back in July, Harris also called for unity and urged Americans to “embrace a robust discussion of what is at stake in this election.”

“There must be unity around the idea that while our nation’s history has been scarred by political violence, violence is never acceptable. There can be no equivocation about that,” Harris said at the time. “At the same time, the hallmark of American democracy, the hallmark of any democracy, is a strong competition of ideas, policies, and a vision for the future.”

“Just as we must reject political violence, we must also embrace a robust discussion about what is at stake in this election,” the vice president added.

Harris released a statement Wednesday on The Atlantic’s story on Trump and the former president’s alleged comment about Hitler’s generals. This time, she dialed up the heated rhetoric despite her previous calls for unity and more civility, likening Trump himself to Hitler. (RELATED: The Atlantic’s October Surprise On Trump Implodes After Denials Galore From Everyone Involved)

“In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the ‘enemy from within’ and even said that he would use the United States military to go after American citizens. And let’s be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within. Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would qualify, in his mind, as the enemy within, like judges, like journalists, like nonpartisan election officials,” she said.

“It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans.”

The vice president also called Trump a “fascist” during a CNN town hall Wednesday.

“You quoted General Milly calling Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” host Anderson Cooper asked.

“Yes I do,” Harris replied. “And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”

It’s pretty clear at this point that Harris and other Democrats do not care at all about the consequences of their rhetoric, despite all their hollow lamentations in September and July. I hate to say it, but with each suggestion that Trump is a fascist, a dictator, Hitler reincarnated, they might as well be painting a target on the former president’s back.

A pair of medical emergencies delayed a Pennsylvania town hall with former President Donald Trump this month and kicked off a round of conspiracies about the Republican nominee’s age.

“Trump Bobs His Head to Music for 30 Minutes in Odd Town Hall Detour,” The New York Times headlined its coverage.

“After multiple interruptions, Donald Trump cut off questions and seemed to decide that it would be more enjoyable for all concerned — and, it appeared, for himself — if he fired up his campaign playlist,” the Times reported.

The delay provoked headlines across mass media uncritically depicting Trump as a senior who is suffering the same cognitive decline that ultimately forced President Joe Biden out of his race for reelection this summer.

“Trump’s Bizarre Turn At Town Hall Has Critics Asking New Questions About His Health,” The Huffington Post titled its coverage.

“Trump sways and bops to music for 39 minutes in bizarre town hall episode,” The Washington Post stated.

“Is Trump okay?” asked The Week. “Former president’s mental health is firmly back in the spotlight after ‘bizarre’ town hall event.”

“This should freak everybody out,” said Whoopi Goldberg on “The View.” “This freaked me out. He’s freaked me out a lot, but this really upset me.”

Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign seized on the moment to characterize the 78-year-old ex-commander-in-chief as cognitively deteriorating in the final moments of his third presidential run.

“Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen on stage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes,” Harris’ rapid-response campaign account wrote on X.

Former President Barack Obama picked up the fabricated storyline at several recent campaign events for Harris.

“The point of a town meeting is to take questions,” Obama said in Arizona last week. “He just decided, you know what, ‘I’m gonna stop taking questions’ and then he’s swaying to ‘Ave Maria’ and ‘YMCA’ for about half an hour.”

After glossing over the medical emergencies that interrupted Trump’s Pennsylvania proceedings this month, Obama went on to Detroit Tuesday and repeated the same manufactured talking points after the Republican candidate canceled a town hall with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“We do not need to see what an older, loonier version of Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails,” Obama said.

The Trump campaign, however, said the former president’s participation was canceled due to a scheduling conflict.

Conservative podcast host Dan Bongino called out the Harris campaign for peddling the latest narrative about Trump’s cognitive health based on an interview with his program.

“Trump abruptly ends his live interview after it is reported that he is canceling interviews because he is ‘exhausted,’” an official Harris X feed reported with a clip of Trump on Bongino’s podcast.

The host called “BULLSH-T.”

“He stayed LONGER than planned and signed a baseball and other items for charitable hurricane relief for another 10 min[ute]s afterwards,” Bongino said on X.

BULLSHIT.

He stayed LONGER than planned and signed a baseball and other items for charitable hurricane relief for another 10 mins afterwards.

A heavily debunked Atlantic hit piece gave Kamala Harris the pretext to justify political violence against former President Donald Trump in a Wednesday afternoon address from the vice president’s official residence in Washington, D.C.

Harris, without an iota of evidence, told the American people that if Trump were to become president again, he would create a dictatorial, Adolf Hitler-esque regime. That exact rhetoric is part of a larger pattern of priming Democrat voters for violent resistance to another Trump presidency. It has been most recently fueled by an Atlantic hit piece that relied on unnamed sources and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, well known for his disdain of Trump, to smear the former president of being a “fascist” and wishing for the kind of generals Hitler had.

“It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds-of-thousands of Americans,” Harris said. “All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.”

Kelly’s allegations about the Hitler comments came, conveniently, five-and-a-half years after they allegedly occurred and just two weeks before a presidential election. To put it bluntly, Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., said, “John Kelly is full of sh-t, and I have the receipts.”

Harris’ comments come off the back of what was, for any honest observer, an election interference operation by far-left media outlets like The Atlantic and The New York Times intent on helping their Democrat friends in the fourth quarter of the campaign season.

As The Federalist reported, the article from The Atlantic, written by propagandist Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, was a thinly sourced hatchet job discredited, publicly, by actual people who were in the room of the alleged incident. In addition to the claim about Hitler’s generals, it also claimed that Trump used expletives to express his disdain for a slain American service member of Mexican origin, Private Vanessa Guillén, and the payment for her funeral. That claim was debunked by everyone involved, including the Guillén’s sister, Mayra, who said Goldberg’s characterization was “exploiting my sister’s death for politics.”

Even Mark Esper, Trump’s former defense secretary who has been at odds with Trump, said he never heard anything like the comments attributed to Trump in these eleventh-hour hit pieces.

That did not stop Harris from parroting the lies, however. And, to make matters worse, she made the remarks at the official residence of the vice president, Number One Observatory Circle.

“As the unofficial magazine of the ultra-wealthy left, The Atlantic understood the assignment in dressing up years-old claims as though it were brand new,” Curtis Houck, managing editor of the Media Research Center’s Newsbusters, told The Federalist. “There is no bottom for an outlet that, as we’ve seen with the pushback from Pvt. Guillen’s family, some Gold Star families mean more to the liberal media than others.”

“This is election interference to the nth power. The Atlantic wants to talk about Donald Trump as a danger to democracy, but the same could be said of Jeffrey Goldberg’s pathetic rag. In the name of long-form journalism, they’ve used their magazine and weekly show on PBS as weapons in its idolatrous hatred of Donald Trump and/or anyone who stands in their way,” Houck added. “The Atlantic, by virtue of being owned by Kamala Harris’s longtime personal friend, Laurene Powell Jobs, should be dismissed in terms of credibility as though they were a hostile foreign actor laundering conspiracy theories.”

Harris continued to fearmonger, saying that a second Trump administration would target judges, journalists, and election officials.

“Let’s be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within. Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would qualify, in his mind, as the enemy within, like judges, like journalists, like non partisan election officials,” Harris continued. She added that a new Trump administration would not have the likes of Kelly there to act as “guardrails” against apparent genocide, or “pursuing the worst impulses.”

“He wants a military who will be loyal to him, personally, one that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States,” Harris said. “In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans ‘the enemy from within,’ and even said that he would use the United States military to go after American citizens.”

Trump has only called far-left rioters and looters, akin to the type the country experienced in the 2020 George Floyd riots, “the enemy from within” — and did so in response to the potential for riots if he is again elected in 2024. Those groups, like Antifa and Black Lives Matter, wrought untold billions of dollars in destruction to cities across the country.

“Kamala is showing signs of ‘cornered rat syndrome’ — she’s using an outdated, unbelievable and debunked storyline as a last ditch effort to save her failing campaign. It’s so desperate and pathetic,” Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, told The Federalist. “Kamala has lost this election due to her extremist anti-family policies — including her support for taxpayer funded sex change procedures for not just inmates, but minor children as well. They’ve been calling Trump ‘Hitler’ since he got into politics.”

Regardless, while the fabrications about the Guillén family may appear new, Kelly and Goldberg’s Hitler claims are actually old, but still fake, news. The Hitler hoax may have first appeared in a 2022 edition of The New Yorker, suggesting that the entire concerted effort from The Atlantic and the Harris campaign is a recycled hoax.

Facebook’s “Supreme Court” has ruled that Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platforms must unblock a satirical image depicting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz as the idiotic main characters of the 1994 comedy Dumb and Dumber.

The Wrap reports that in a decision announced on Wednesday, Meta’s Oversight Board determined that Facebook’s removal of the satirical image, which features Harris and Walz grabbing each other’s nipples through their clothing replacing Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels on the Dumb and Dumber movie poster, was an overreach of the company’s bullying and harassment policies. The image, posted by a user in August, was accompanied by a shrug emoji and two middle finger emojis, and was promptly taken down by Facebook for violating rules prohibiting the sharing of “derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings.”

The user who posted the image appealed the ban to the Oversight Board, a body established by Meta in 2020 to review Facebook’s censorship decisions. The board, comprised of 20 primarily leftist members including American legal scholars and the former prime minister of Denmark, agreed that the post should have remained on the platform, deeming Facebook’s action an example of “overenforcement” of its Bullying policy, particularly in regards to satire and political speech.

In its ruling, the Oversight Board emphasized the potential dangers of excessively removing political speech, especially in the context of an election, as it may undermine the ability to criticize government officials and political candidates, even in a sarcastic manner. The board stated, “This post is nothing more than a commonplace satirical image of prominent politicians and is instantly recognizable as such.”

The decision highlights the ongoing challenges social media platforms face in balancing free speech and content moderation, particularly when it comes to political discourse and satire. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, the role of social media in shaping public opinion and facilitating political debate is likely to come under increasing scrutiny.

Following the Oversight Board’s ruling, Facebook restored the original post featuring the satirical image of Harris and Walz.

Former registered Democrats in Pennsylvania who now support former President Trump predict a wave of traditional Democrat voters quietly pulling the ballot box lever for the Republican ticket over Vice President Kamala Harris in the key battleground state this year.

"This is Lackawanna County, okay. This is Scranton. This is where Joe Biden was born. This is where Robert Reich was born. Hillary Clinton has ties here with her family. This was a deep, deep blue county. But, when you walk into the poll, I think a lot of these people are going to are going to think twice and think, 'well, nobody knows how I'm voting — which is the way it's supposed to be — I'm going with Trump,'" registered independent voter David Kveragas told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week.

Kveragas is a resident of the battleground county of Lackawanna, which is nestled in Pennsylvania’s Wyoming Valley and has traditionally voted blue, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Reagan’s blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota — the home state of Reagan’s competitor that year, former Vice President Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE VOTER REGISTRATION DATA SHOWS INFLUENTIAL SHIFTS FAVORING GOP

Fox News Digital spoke with three Lackawanna County residents who were all previously registered Democrats who now full heartedly support Trump, despite initial hesitance and even outright disapproval during his first presidential run in 2016.

Susanne Green is a former Democrat who even previously worked for Planned Parenthood in Washington, D.C., as the abortion provider’s financial manager and now supports Trump and is actively involved as a volunteer for the campaign.

Green said that she also anticipates her left-leaning neighbors and friends will quietly vote for Trump.

"They may be registered Republican or Democrat or independent, but they have told me privately, ‘Susanne, I'm not going to put a sign in my yard. I don't want everybody to know who I'm voting for, but I'm going to vote for Trump,'" Green told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this month.

Vince Sardo, a retired firefighter and former union boss of the Dunmore Firefighters IAFF Local 860, told Fox News Digital in a separate interview he also believes many of his Democrat friends and neighbors will vote for Trump without fanfare or changing their political affiliation.

"I have many friends that are registered Democrats, I'm not going to mention names, but some of them are Democratic leaders in communities, and they're voting for Trump," the formerly longtime registered Democrat told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.

'VINDICTIVE': DEMOCRAT IN TIGHT SENATE RACE BLASTED BY GOP RIVAL FOR SWIPE AT MCDONALD'S AFTER TRUMP VISIT

Political eyes are locked on Pennsylvania as the state that will likely determine the outcome of the election. Trump and Harris have both repeatedly zigzagged the state campaigning in recent weeks, while voter registration for the state released this week shows sizable shifts benefitting the GOP in the final stretch of the election cycle.

Following the close of voter registration in Pennsylvania on Monday, the Democratic Party accounts for nearly 44% of registered voters compared to the GOP's 40%, but has seen its advantage over Republicans dwindle this year.

President Biden won the state in 2020 by 1.17 percentage points​. That year, Democrats had a larger margin of registered voters compared to their Republican counterparts, at 4.2 million to 3.5 million. The data show that Democrats had a registration advantage over Republicans by 685,818 voters during the election that Biden won by 80,555 votes.

The GOP has whittled down that lead this year to a 297,824 margin. When comparing registered voters this election year to 2020, Democrats face a net loss of 257,281 voters, while Republicans have a net gain of 428,537 registered voters.

More than double the number of previously registered Democrats changed their party affiliation this cycle compared to the number of registered Republicans who left the party : 54,668 registered Democrats changed their party affiliation, compared to 25,634 Republicans, Pennsylvania Department of State data shows.

"I don't think it's going to be quite as close as they're saying. I mean, both sides are going to say that because you always play like you're behind. That just goes with campaigning. I just see too much momentum for Trump. We won't know that night, because in Pennsylvania we're so slow," Kveragas said.

Fox News Digital spoke with the three Pennsylvania voters about their voting history and found that each individual had deep ties to the Democratic Party before registering as a Republican — or in Kveragas’ case, registering as a Republican in the 1990s, before registering as an independent when Mitt Romney was at the top of the GOP presidential ticket in 2012.

Green told Fox News Digital that she was raised in a Catholic, Democratic household in Pennsylvania, similar to many people across the commonwealth back in the 1960s and 1970s. She argued that the Democratic Party of her youth had morphed into the left-wing party that she described as "radical."

"It meant that you were a patriot," Green told Fox Digital of what it meant to be a Democrat back in the 1970s. "That was a time when there was the bicentennial and everything was red, white and blue. There was, you know, happy patriotism… It was about doing what was right for your country. It was living together in harmony."

INEFFECTIVE PLANNING, LACK OF CONNECTIONS HAS DEMS ON EDGE IN 'KEY' BATTLEGROUND: REPORT

Green registered as a Democrat as a young adult and spoke with Fox Digital about her employment with Planned Parenthood as its financial manager in Washington, D.C., in 2000.

"Safe, legal and rare. Which was the advertisement at the time when I worked at Planned Parenthood. That abortion should be safe, legal and rare. And I believe that I still feel that way today. I did find out when I worked there that there were people from all affiliations who would make contributions to Planned Parenthood. Many people were Republicans… and I found out at that point it was called Republicans for Choice, which is actually a very large movement now," Green said, noting that she has never been a hard-line supporter of abortion but believes there should be exceptions such as in the case of rape, incest or life of the mother.

The 2016 election spurred Green to rethink her support of the Democratic Party, pointing to Donna Brazile when she worked as a CNN commentator and fed debate questions during the primary process to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

"I didn't feel that there was a change until, I would say, until Hillary Clinton was running. And I did see a change at that time. And I recall getting ready to vote in the primary… I think I was living in Virginia at the time, and finding out that she had colluded with, I think, with the chairman of the DNC to obtain the questions for the debate against Bernie Sanders and perhaps others. And I thought, 'That's not right. That's not something anybody should be doing,'" she said.

Green voted for Trump in 2016 and is now volunteering for the campaign in Lackawanna County.

For Sardo, he switched political teams and voted for Trump in the 2020 election.

"Just towards the end of my career, I retired in 2019… as far as the way I looked at it with the Democratic Party, they just started going way too far left for me," Sardo said.

POPULAR PA DEMOCRATIC MAYOR WARNS TRUMP IS ‘OUT-MESSAGING’ HARRIS: 'I GET MORE FROM COLBERT'

In addition to disagreeing with COVID-19 directives and mandates in the 2020 era, Sardo said he has a "major issue" with how parents speaking out about trans issues were characterized as "domestic terrorists."

"I had a major issue, I really did with, you know, parents that were kind of protesting against drag shows and elementary centers and kids mutilating their body. And then they became domestic terrorists because they're at school board meetings. You know, just crazy stuff that was going on. Men in women's sports. I mean, really, come on," he said.

"I really started looking at, you know, the morality. And I think that was the turning point for me is being a God-fearing type person and finding my spirituality again, because it was lost younger in my life. But, I just couldn't go along for the ride anymore with, you know, the way things were going with the Democratic Party going that far left," he said.

Sardo said that in his social circles of union workers and longtime Democrats, he is seeing big changes regarding how they will vote this election.

"I'm seeing a huge change. I have a lot of local friends because I was a union leader and then down in Harrisburg. And then when I came back, I was asked to help on Lackawanna County elections. I've helped on a commissioner race, and I've helped on local races in my community, my town, my borough. And I have a lot of people that are on Democratic committees and Democratic leadership roles in our community that are voting for Trump," he said.

Sardo added that he believes many Democrats will not change their party affiliation despite supporting Trump, citing the commonwealth’s closed primary process, which only allows voters to cast ballots for primary candidates in their registered party.

HARRIS' CATHOLIC DINNER SNUB IS JUST THE LATEST IN CAREER FULL OF SWIPES AT THE FAITHFUL, CRITICS CHARGE

Kveragas is a registered independent voter and was no fan of Trump’s until he saw the 45th president’s policies put into action.

"I didn't vote for Trump [in 2016]. I voted against Hillary Clinton, who I paid a lot of attention to. I knew that we would be in deep trouble, especially coming out of the Obama years if we let her get in," he said.

"I actually had a letter in The Wall Street Journal in May of ‘16 because he was complaining about how the primaries work. And I said, you know, he can step out of the primary at any time if he doesn't like the system, you know, he can just leave. So I was not a Trump supporter even going into the election," he said.

The tide began to change for Kveragas when Trump was in office, and he saw improvements to the economy and peace across the world.

"He started cutting taxes. He started cutting regulations. The economy improved greatly. My retirement accounts, etc., were going up. We had peace. There were no new wars, no new real foreign incursions. We still had Afghanistan, but he was getting that as much under control as he could. I'm not big on foreign affairs, but he did the Abraham Accords, which was amazing. I mean, anyone else would get the Nobel Peace Prize for that. He got Arab countries to recognize Israel for the first time in their history. He went to South Korea. He went to North Korea and negotiated to get the remains of our soldiers lost in that war. And I had three uncles who served in Korea. So that's important to me there. He brought them back. He finally got that settled," Kveragas said.

For the trio of former Democrats who now support Trump, they all reported more or less the same: The Democratic Party has shifted harder to the left, leaving many Democrats finding refuge with Trump.

"It's so, so radical right now. I am shocked that there are still so many people who feel that, or don't realize, what direction the ship is about to go in. I mean, if the Democrats… win I am afraid for our country. I'm literally afraid for our country," Green said.
A new national poll is the latest to indicate former President Trump with an edge over Vice President Harris in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House.

Trump grabs 47% support among likely voters nationwide, with Harris at 45%, according to a Wall Street Journal survey released on Wednesday evening — on a ballot that also includes third-party and independent candidates.

That's a switch from the Journal's previous national survey, conducted in late August, which indicated Harris with a 2-point edge.

The former president's advantage is within the new survey's margin of error, which means that either Trump or the vice president could potentially be leading the race.

The Wall Street Journal poll — of 1,500 registered voters questioned Oct. 19-22 — also shows Trump holding a 3-point margin (49%-46%) over Harris in a head-to-head match-up.

The survey indicates views of Harris have turned more negative since August, with her favorable rating 8 points underwater and her approval rating as vice president at 42%-54%. Meanwhile, views of Trump have improved, with voters approving of his past performance in the White House by a 52%-48% margin.

The new poll follows a Fox News national survey conducted Oct. 11-14 and released last week that indicated the Republican presidential nominee had a 2-point edge over the Democratic Party standard-bearer.

Many other national surveys in the field the past two weeks, including polls from CBS News, Marist, and USA Today/Suffolk University, have indicated Harris with a slight advantage over Trump. But the polls are mostly within the margin of error.

Harris replaced a faltering President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket on July 21, and instantly experienced a surge in fundraising and a rise in her poll numbers.

Harris enjoyed the edge over Trump in most national polling amid the Democratic National Convention in late August and the first and only debate between the vice president and the former president, in early September.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS INDICATE IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

But many national surveys conducted in late September and October have pointed to Trump making gains at the expense of Harris.

The latest Fox News poll results [Trump with 50% support and Harris at 48%] were a reversal from last month, when the vice president had the edge.

"Overall, the movement toward Trump is subtle but potentially consequential, especially if he is making gains among college-educated voters," said veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. "However, the race has been well within the margin of error for three months and the outcome will likely hinge on which side is more effective at getting their voters to the polls as opposed to persuasion."

While national polls are helpful, the race for the White House is not based on the national popular vote, and instead is a battle for the states and their electoral votes.

And the latest surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election are mostly within the margin of error.

The Fox News poll indicated Harris with a 6-point advantage over Trump among respondents questioned in all seven battleground states.

CAMPAIGN BATTLE BETWEEN THE BILLIONAIRES: MARK CUBAN AND ELON MUSK HIT THE TRAIL FOR HARRIS AND TRUMP

While polls point to a race within the margins, in the dash for campaign cash — another key metric in presidential politics — Harris is the clear front-runner.

The vice president entered the final full month of the campaign with a massive financial advantage over the former president, according to the latest federal fundraising filings.

The Harris campaign hauled in $221.8 million in September, according to the filings, more than triple the $63 million brought in by the Trump campaign last month.

Harris has vastly outraised and outspent Trump in the past few months, and that trend continued in September. The largest expense by the Harris campaign was for paid media — mostly to run ads.

But the vice president still enjoyed a large cash-on-hand advantage over Trump entering October.

The Harris campaign reported $187 million in its coffers at the end of September, compared to $119 million for the Trump campaign.

The fundraising totals reported by the two major party campaigns don't include additional money raked in by the two national party committees, other affiliated organizations — both campaigns use a slew of affiliated fundraising committees to haul in cash — or aligned super-PACs supporting Harris and Trump.
CLARKSTON, GA. — Vice President Harris teamed up on the campaign trail for the first time Friday evening with arguably the most popular Democratic Party politician: former President Obama.

While Obama has been stumping in the key swing states the past couple weeks on behalf of the vice president, he joined her on the stage as they aimed to energize supporters in the crucial southeastern battleground of Georgia to cast their ballots in early voting.

The event came with just 12 days to go until Election Day in Harris' margin-of-error battle with former President Trump in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House.

"Here in Georgia, early voting has already started. If you have not already, go vote! Return your absentee ballot," the former president told the massive crowd of over 20,000 people packed into a local football stadium.

And taking aim at his successor in the White House, Obama charged "what I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody, but himself."

After Obama introduced the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris pointed to her longtime friendship with the former president and said "your friendship and your faith in me and in our campaign means the world."

FROM ‘JOYFUL WARRIOR’ TO CALLING TRUMP A ‘FACIST’ - KAMALA HARRIS CHANGES HER MESSAGING IN THE FINAL STRETCH

But it wasn't just political rock stars that teamed up with Harris.

Rock legend Bruce Springsteen, whom Harris called an "American icon" and who has been supporting Democratic presidential candidates for two decades, performed three songs at Friday evening's rally.

"Kamala Harris. She's running to be the 47th President of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American," Springsteen argued.

Also speaking at the vice president's rally in suburban Atlanta were actor, filmmaker and playwright Tyler Perry, film director, producer, screenwriter and actor Spike Lee, and actor Samuel L. Jackson.

Pointing to Lee and Jackson, Obama joked "you’ve got a couple of guys from those Capital One commercials. If that doesn’t get you fired up to vote, I don’t know what will."

While Harris was in Georgia, legendary musician James Taylor was scheduled to perform at a rally in neighboring North Carolina – another key battleground – headlined by Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Taylor was scheduled to perform at the DNC but was bumped due to timing issues.

Last weekend, Harris rallied supporters at a get-out-the-vote event in Atlanta with pop singer and star Usher. Hours earlier at a campaign event in Detroit on the city's first day of early voting, the vice president teamed up with Motor City native rapper Lizzo.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS INDICATE IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

Another Detroit-born star, rapper, songwriter and music producer Eminem, joined Obama at a Tuesday rally in the battleground state's largest city to get-out-the-vote for Harris.

And the vice president will reportedly be joined at a rally in Houston on Friday by Beyoncé, who is considered a cultural icon. Beyoncé's hit song "Freedom" has been adopted by the vice president as her campaign trail anthem.

While she hasn't joined Harris at a campaign event, singer and songwriting superstar Taylor Swift endorsed the vice president last month on the evening of the only debate between Harris and Trump.

Asked about the star power at her events, Harris said on Thursday, "I think it just shows the breadth and depth of the support that we have and also the enthusiasm that a lot of people are bringing to the campaign and feel about our campaign."

Trump campaign rapid response director Jake Schneider, reacting to the star-studded event, charged that "relying on celebrities is nothing new for the party of Hollywood elites."

While he can't match the surrogate star power that Harris enjoys, Trump has also attracted some well-known celebrities at his events.

The latest, country singer Jason Aldean, took the stage at Trump's rally on Wednesday evening in Duluth, Georgia. The singer, a longtime supporter of Trump, sat with the former president at the Republican National Convention in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The former president also enjoys the backing of other celebrities, including Telsa founder and multibillionaire Elon Musk, hip-hop star, rapper and fashion designer Kanye West, singer Kid Rock, actors Jon Voight and Kelsey Grammar, former NFL star quarterback Brett Favre, former Indy racer Danica Patrick, and celebrity chef Paula Deen.

While celebrity endorsements can grab plenty of media attention and add excitement to campaign rallies, it's questionable how much they move the needle in terms of bringing a new wave of support to a candidate.

Veteran Republican strategist David Kochel noted that using celebrities has "been a big part of the playbook for a long time," especially with Democrat presidential candidates.

But he argued that they rarely "move people" or "move the message."
They’ve attacked him. They’ve impeached him. They’ve arrested him. They’ve desperately tried to imprison him. They unconstitutionally denied him access to the ballot. They’ve tried to kill him.

Democrats have failed at every turn to get rid of Donald Trump.

Now the self-proclaimed defenders of democracy and their corporate media allies are turning to the last vestige of hope for the desperate in an extremely tight presidential race: Lies.

And name-calling.

‘Do You Think Donald Trump Is a Fascist?’

Democrat presidential hopeful Kamala Harris opened Wednesday night’s CNN town hall with a long tirade in which she warned ostensibly undecided voters that Trump would be a dictator if given another term in the Oval Office.

“Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” host Anderson Cooper asked the vice president in the opening moments of the latest long-form, packaged-as-news political ad for the Harris-Walz campaign.

“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” Harris answered as if reciting an unholy wedding vow.

Of course she does. The “Trump is Hitler” narrative is Harris’ — and the left’s — closing argument in a Reader’s Digest presidential campaign for the Democrats. It must be noted that Harris’ abridged quest began with the Democrats’ bloodless coup that removed the demented Democrat president of the United States from his run for a second term.

In an act of corporate media collusion so transparent it burns the eyes, the shameless Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief at The Atlantic, published the hit piece earlier this week that Harris and her team are using in one last-ditch effort to paint the former president as “unfit” to be president again. The smear job, citing bitter former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, claims, among other outlandish charges, that while in office Trump suggested Hitler “did some good things.” The story, mostly employing anonymous sources, was quickly debunked on the record by multiple people who were in the room with Trump.

As my Federalist colleague John Daniel Davidson wrote, the story “would never have passed muster in a newsroom 20 years ago.” And former Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi aptly noted on X, “The Hunter Biden laptop story couldn’t be repeated by any major outlet because it hadn’t been independently verified. The Atlantic pieces can be repeated by everyone. Weird how that works.”

The Hunter Biden laptop story couldn't be repeated by any major outlet because it hadn't been independently verified. The Atlantic pieces can be repeated by everyone. Weird how that works. — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) October 23, 2024

Of course, it’s not weird at all. Painting the former president as the devil has long been the playbook. Lies and empty accusations are just fine, if they’re in pursuit of what the left thinks is right. And what is right to the Democrats is holding on to power by any means necessary.

Just ask the late spawn of satan, Harry Reid. The nasty, formerly breathing Democrat senator infamously lied about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney not paying his taxes. Reid lied from the Senate floor. When called out on his lie, Reid sneered, “Romney didn’t win, did he?”

‘She May Lose’

That’s the left. It’s what they do. And, yes, sometimes the lies work.

But there is political peril for Harris. Voters have heard it all from Democrats, particularly the patently false stuff about Trump and his relationship with the military and service members.

As pollster and political strategist Frank Luntz told CNN’s Kasie Hunt hours before her network’s town hall, Harris runs a real risk of alienating the relatively few undecideds in the race. Luntz said Harris did well in the opening days of her Joe Biden replacement campaign focusing on “why she should be elected.” Remember all those “good vibes” and joy and crap?

“She’s had the best 60 days of any presidential candidate in modern history. And then the moment that she turned anti-Trump and focused on him and said, ‘Don’t vote for me, vote against him,’ that’s when everything froze,” the strategist said.

The polls show as much. Trump in recent weeks has devoured any gap as Harris could no longer hide and had to answer at least some actual questions about her record and her agenda. In Harris parlance, he is unburdened by what has been.

Trump is defined, Luntz said.

“He’s not gaining, he’s not losing. He’s who he is and his vote is where it is,” the pollster said.

“[Harris] is less well defined and if she continues just to define this race as ‘vote against Trump,’ she’s going to stay where she is now and she may lose.”

But desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess. Democrats haven’t been able to stop Trump to date. So they’re hoping to deal him a death blow with lies.

Matt Kittle is a senior elections correspondent for The Federalist. An award-winning investigative reporter and 30-year veteran of print, broadcast, and online journalism, Kittle previously served as the executive director of Empower Wisconsin.
The outlandish hit piece on Donald Trump published this week by Jeffery Goldberg at The Atlantic, which was immediately denied on the record by all the people who were in the room with Trump, isn’t just a shoddy smear that would never have passed muster in a newsroom 20 years ago.

It’s more than that. It’s part of a larger psy-op to justify mass post-election violence if Trump wins in November, to signal activists to reject the results of the election, to divide the military, and to coax an insurgency out of the radical left-wing base of the Democratic Party and unleash it on American cities.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ shocking remarks Wednesday on the steps of the Naval Observatory should be understood in this light. Citing comments quoted in The Atlantic from former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, Harris explicitly compared Trump to Hitler and claimed that if elected he will rule as a dictator and unleash the military on his domestic political opponents.

“He does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution, he wants a military that is loyal to him,” she said. “He wants a military that is loyal to him personally. One that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States.”

Harris went on to call Trump a fascist, claim he would be a dictator on day one, and repeat a line she’s been using often lately, that Trump will use the military to go after American citizens, using it as “his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas.” She closed by saying Trump is “increasing unhinged and unstable” and that he “wants unchecked power.”

Soon after her remarks, Harris’s X account posted these claims without reference to Kelly or the The Atlantic piece, repeating the Hitler smear and all the rest as fact:

Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution.



He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses. https://t.co/v4f8HbhmGU — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 23, 2024

This is not just the normal heated rhetoric that comes out in the final weeks of a close presidential election. This is something else. It is at least a tacit call for violent resistance, for insurrection, and even for a third assassination attempt against Trump.

It’s hard to overstate how reckless and dangerous this is two weeks before an election that Harris appears to be losing. Having staked out this rhetorical ground, what is she supposed to say if she loses the election? How is she supposed to concede? Will she come out and say, “Sorry everyone we tried hard to save America but now you must all live peacefully under the new Hitler?”

She’s not going to say that. She can’t now. She’s going to call for resistance. “Patriotic resistance,” she might call it, but it will be coded as a call for street violence or worse. After all, you don’t just accept a Hitler-like, fascist regime. You fight it any way you can.

This is why, after the first assassination attempt back in July, many of us called for a cooling of the rhetoric coming from the left. Joe Biden’s repeated insistence throughout the spring and early summer that Trump represented an existential threat to democracy created an opening for radicals and would-be assassins to take action against Trump. And then one of them actually did in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Even after Trump was shot in the face, Democrats didn’t listen. Harris picked up right where Biden left off, repeating the line, over and over, that a second Trump term would be the end of our democracy, the last election, the rise of an authoritarian regime. If those are the stakes, what are people supposed to do? Vote and hope for the best? Of course not. Harris and the Democrats kept pushing the line that a Trump presidency meant the end of America as we know it. And so, inevitably, there was a second assassination attempt.

And now, as we come down to Election Day and Harris’ campaign looks to be failing, they are going in one last time, more explicitly than before, to make the case that Trump is Hitler and his return to the White House means the end of American democracy.

And it’s not just Harris or her campaign pushing this. On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked whether Biden agrees that Trump is a fascist and a would-be dictator. She said he does agree, and then went a long rant about how dangerous Trump is, how we can’t forget about Jan. 6, how we can’t forget that “two thousand people were told to go to the Capitol and undo a free and fair election by the former president.”

Is this reckless and dangerous? Is it designed to prepare the ground for mass violence? Is it assassination prep? Yes, it’s all those things. But understand that we’re not dealing with a normal political party here. We’re dealing with an ensconced institutional oligarchy that has already executed a coup against the previous Democrat nominee (and sitting president), forcing him to end his reelection campaign. They have already discarded millions of Democrat primary votes to install their hand-picked successor despite their claims to care about “preserving democracy.” They have already refused to tone down their incendiary rhetoric despite two assassination attempts against Trump.

In other words, these are not people who care about political norms. They care about power and power alone. And by invoking the specter of Hitler and fascism, Harris is laying the groundwork for a post-election display of power that will shock the country, ruin our cities, and paralyze our civic life.

And even if you think it goes too far to say that Harris and the Democrats are tacitly calling for violence in the event of a Trump victory, at the very least they are providing a permission structure for a vast swath of the Democrat Party to reject the results of the election. And we all know what that means.
Elections are one of the most crucial parts of any democracy, and unfortunately that also means bad actors try to twist things for their own gain.

With the U.S. general elections just around the corner, cybersecurity risks are ramping up, not just to the systems running the election but also to you. Social media and the internet are being used to spread propaganda and sway your opinions.

What’s even more concerning is that these campaigns are now powered by AI tools, making it very easy for bad actors to churn out misleading information at lightning speed and on a huge scale.

Your opinions might not be yours

Technology has made it so easy for bad actors to mess with your opinions, and this isn’t anything new. We’re constantly being persuaded, whether it’s during a presidential debate, reading the news or even just watching an ad. But things cross the line when fake facts get involved. Arguing based on real points is fine, but flat-out lying with made-up facts? That’s a whole different story.

You might see people trying to sway your decisions with shocking headlines, heated tweets or videos that play on your biases. Much of this content could be created by generative AI (GenAI), which sometimes just makes up completely false info.

A recent study by Trend Micro found that many people are struggling to spot misinformation and scams, many of which are currently election related. While 79% of U.S. respondents felt somewhat confident or very confident about their ability to identify online scams, a staggering 62% failed to correctly identify a specific example as a scam.

Lynette Owens, vice president of global consumer education and marketing at Trend Micro, shared her thoughts with CyberGuy on the gap between people's confidence in spotting misinformation and their actual ability to do so.

"Many individuals have likely had scam detection or cybersecurity training, at least on some level, through their employer. This, along with using obvious scam examples in training materials, may lead to people overestimating their ability to spot scams and misinformation. Recently, with the help of AI, scams, deepfakes and ways to spread misinformation have also become increasingly sophisticated. While people may believe they can spot a phishing text or a scam call, many may not have had to face or identify more recent and highly believable scam emails or fake websites."

HOW TO RECLAIM YOUR PHONE AND BLOCK UNWELCOME POLITICAL TEXT MESSAGES

The dangers of GenAI

GenAI can be used in more ways than you can imagine to mess with elections, as highlighted by Trend Micro . It can quickly churn out fake news, create deepfake videos and audio, automate hacking and write convincing phishing emails. Plus, GenAI helps make social media content and gives foreign adversaries almost-native language skills and cultural know-how to blend in more easily.

For instance, AI-driven bots can pump out fake news articles and imitate human-like conversations on social media. These bots can spread misinformation fast. Last August, an investigation by the Centre for Information Resilience found 56 fake accounts on platform X (formerly Twitter). These accounts were part of a coordinated effort promoting the Trump-Vance ticket for the 2024 U.S. presidential race. There’s no evidence that the Trump campaign had anything to do with it.

The U.S. Department of Justice also recently seized fake news websites mimicking media outlets like the Washington Post. These counterfeit websites contained articles designed to influence readers' sentiment to favor Russian interests.

DON’T FALL PREY TO THIS ELECTION SEASON’S CRAFTIEST SCAMS

The damage potential of deepfakes

Thanks to advancements in AI, it’s now easier than ever to create incredibly realistic deepfakes. Even people with little to no technical know-how can manipulate images and videos, opening the door to election tampering and spreading false info. Politicians are especially at risk because they’re all over the media, in magazine photos, news interviews and speeches. This exposure makes it easier to train AI models.

These deepfakes can damage someone’s credibility by spreading false information, manipulating public opinion and deepening political divides. In August, social media blew up with an AI-generated video of presidential candidate Kamala Harris making fake statements in a doctored campaign ad. The video was even shared by big names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Tools like Deepfake 3D Pro, Deepfake AI, SwapFace and AvatarAI VideoCallSpoofer – commonly found on criminal forums – are some of the most popular ones used to create deepfakes. These tools can bypass verification systems, generate compromising videos or even fake real-time video calls, all of which make the threat to election integrity even more serious.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

The most common types of election-related misinformation or scams

While there are plenty of election-related misinformation and scams to be aware of, Owens highlights three major ones to watch out for besides deepfakes:

1. Voter registration scams involve links to fake voter registration forms, which scammers send by phone, email or text. These types of links may be phishing scams to collect personal data (such as passwords, financial information and Social Security numbers) or to allow others to access your devices.

2. Campaign donation scams involve cybercriminals reaching out to voters by email, social media or phone, posing as a political action committee to steal money or personal information.

3. Fake surveys, petitions and polls involve scammers tricking voters into revealing personal information. These scams can come via phone, email, text or even in person, asking people to answer questions or sign a petition under the guise of supporting a political cause. They may feature a politician’s name or image to appear legitimate, sometimes urging recipients to make a small donation. In doing so, victims are led to provide sensitive details like their Social Security number or home address, which can then be exploited for fraud.

5 ways to protect yourself from election-related scams and misinformation

1. Watch out for potential red flags: Be on the lookout for potential red flags when it comes to misinformation and manipulated content, as well as scams. Common signs to watch for include sensationalized headlines that grab your attention, suspicious domains that don’t seem trustworthy, and a sense of urgency or demands for time-sensitive action. Additionally, poor grammar, altered images, missing timestamps and unattributed data are all indicators that something might not be right.

Owens said, "When consuming media, voters should venture beyond the headlines, cross-verify with other news outlets, scrutinize links and sources, research authors, validate images and consult fact-checkers. Observing how significant news develops over time helps to estimate the reliability of the sources of information. By diversifying news sources, focusing on reputable outlets and thinking before sharing, individuals can help combat the spread of election-related fake news."

2. Don’t click every link you see: It's important to be cautious about clicking on every link that comes your way, especially on social media and unfamiliar websites. Many of these links could be scams designed to install malware or steal your money in the name of the election.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

3. Avoid relying on social media for election news: One effective strategy to protect yourself from election-related misinformation is to limit your reliance on social media for obtaining news about elections. Social media platforms are often breeding grounds for misinformation, deepfakes and scams.

4. Invest in personal data removal services: Protecting your personal information from being exploited for political purposes is crucial during election seasons. Consider investing in a reputable data removal service to reduce your digital footprint and minimize the risk of targeted political manipulation. Political campaigns may use data from people search sites to create highly targeted ads based on your personal details, potentially manipulating your views. Also, scammers could use information from these sites to impersonate you for political fraud or to spread misinformation in your name. Your contact information could be used for unsolicited political calls, emails or even in-person visits. Detailed personal information can be used to build comprehensive voter profiles, potentially influencing how political entities approach you.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here .

5. Report suspected election misinformation: If you suspect voter fraud, report it to your state or territorial election office. You can also report it to your local FBI office, your local U.S. attorney's office or the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. You can also report suspected false, offensive or harmful information on social media platforms in several ways.

Kurt's key takeaway

Election Day is less than two weeks away, and it’s more important than ever to keep an eye out for misinformation and scams. First, always double-check your sources when you come across election information; stick to the trustworthy ones and cross-check claims. Be cautious of links since some could lead to scams that steal your money or install malware. Keep an eye out for red flags like sensational headlines and sketchy websites. If you spot any voter fraud or harmful info, report it to the right folks.

Vice President Kamala Harris admitted during an interview with MSNBC that she wants mass amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants who have come to the United States during the Biden-Harris administration.

Telemundo host Julio Vaqueiro grilled Harris on her plans for addressing the massive issue, a longtime weak spot for Democrats even before the border crisis started when Joe Biden became president.

"Right now, we're talking about border security, and there's nobody, no Democrat, talking about pathway to citizenship, immigration relief, benefits that migrants bring to this country," Vaqueiro said to Harris.

"I am. I am talking about it. ... There's no question that ... migrants bring — America is a country that was built in part by immigrants," Harris stammered.

When Vaqueiro brought up former President Donald Trump's plan to conduct mass deportations, Harris interjected that she is not proposing that.

"We need smart, humane immigration policy that includes a pathway to citizenship," Harris continued, adding a need for more "resources in terms of security" at the southern border.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection finally released the data for the number of illegal immigrants encountered at the southern border for fiscal year 2024, which ended at the start of October.

U.S Border Patrol encountered over 1.5 million illegal immigrants in this recent fiscal year, a slight drop from 2 million in fiscal year 2023. The drop in encounters, while still historically high, is due to the Biden-Harris administration expanding the nation's parole program, typically used on a case-by-case basis, to thousands of people per day. This was an effort to reduce the number of illegal crossings in order to reduce the bad optics of people flooding the border even though the strength of their cases is very much in doubt.

Despite those efforts, illegal crossings in areas around Eagle Pass, Texas, are starting to pick up again as illegal immigrants want to enter the country before the presidential election.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday that he thinks former President Donald Trump’s gains with independents in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are making Democrats uneasy.

Trump currently holds narrow leads over Vice President Kamala Harris in all three states, according to RealClearPolling averages. Enten, on “CNN News Central,” noted Trump is now slightly leading among independents in these battleground states, a shift from 2020 when he trailed President Joe Biden with this demographic. (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)

WATCH:

“What do we know about independents, right? Center of the electorate. You go last time around Joe Biden won these voters by 11 points. You look at September of 2024, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up five points among independents. You look now though, look at this. She’s only up by two points among a key bloc, center of the electorate, down nine points from where Biden was at the end of the 2020 campaign,” Enten told host John Berman. “Of course, this is a national picture … What is going on in those key battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the Great Lakes, that blue wall, right?”

“Joe Biden, last time around, won ’em by five points over Donald Trump. Look at where we are today. This is the type of movement Donald Trump likes to see in the center of the electorate, up by a point. Now, of course, that’s well within any margin of error, right? But again, it‘s the movement. It’s the trend, Mr. Berman, that we’re looking at,” he added. “And when you flip a group from going plus five Biden to now plus one Trump. That’s the type of movement Donald Trump loves to see, and it’s the type of movement that I think gives Democrats some agita.”

Enten also asserted presidential candidates who win with independent voters typically secure an election victory, though not always.

“Why are we seeing this movement in the electorate, perhaps away from the Democrats towards Donald Trump? And this is true overall, this is true among independents as well. View as too liberal, right? Are you out of the mainstream, perhaps? 38% said that of Joe Biden back in 2020, now that number is up to 48% for Kamala Harris versus the 40% or so who see Trump as too conservative,” he added. “The bottom line is Harris may be a little bit too out of the mainstream, at least compared to Donald Trump when we’re talking ideologically speaking.”

Harris supported many left-wing policies during her 2020 presidential bid, but reversed some of her stances since launching her 2024 campaign in July. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also has a far-left record on issues such as immigration and transgender policy.

Trump also currently leads Harris in the other four top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages. Journalist Mark Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will be president-elect on Nov. 5 if the present early voting trajectory persists.

“Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said.

Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine said Wednesday that “some voters” are frustrated with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tendency to stick to scripted responses during interviews.

Harris began granting more interviews in October after initially avoiding them following her campaign launch on July 21. Turrentine, on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” based his observation in part on the voters he communicates with on “The Morning Meeting,” a show he co-hosts on journalist Mark Halperin’s 2WAY platform, adding that Harris typically only goes off-script when attacking former President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)

WATCH:

“Her message discipline has been very intense. She has stuck to her kind of narrow set of talking points to the point where I think she’s offended some voters. I hope they haven’t thrown their hands up and locked in for Trump, but it is something you see,” Turrentine said. “You know, we hear it on our show, you see it in the data, both the campaigns’ and what’s out there publicly, that there is frustration that she is so scripted and so tight in her answers.”

“And I think some of her best moments on the campaign have been when she’s leaned forward and had passion and energy and kind of gotten off the talking points, which really, the one issue where we see that is when it’s anti-Trump,” he added. “Like, you can tell she dislikes the guy so much. It really probably is the animating reason why she’s running.”

Turrentine also asserted that he believes “the average voter” would say “she just hates Trump” if asked why they think Harris wants to be elected as president.

“I don’t know if that’s going to be successful or not, but it’s the only place that she kind of lets the guard down, lets the hair down and really shows who she is and how she feels,” he said.

One voter on “The Morning Meeting” recently said, “She’s fake, she’s scripted, she gives a lot of word salad” when asked what she finds most troubling about Harris.

When radio host Charlamagne Tha God brought up criticism about Harris sounding “scripted” during their recent town hall, the vice president responded, “That would be called discipline.”

“The reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election,” she added. “And so it requires repetition.”

As her campaign comes to its end, Harris has changed her messaging from promoting joyfulness to attempting to characterize Trump as a danger to the United States, The New York Times reported. Pollster Frank Luntz said Tuesday that Harris will “fail” to win the election “if she’s just beating up on Donald Trump.”

Trump currently holds small leads over Harris in each of the seven top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

Progressives are pleading with Kamala Harris to celebrate and champion mass migration, but she is following the advice of her calculating corporate backers: Downplay the migration inflow that supercharges voter support for President Donald Trump.

“Harris and other Democrats have tactical incentives to avoid a full-on confrontation with those sentiments in the final weeks before next month’s election,” author Ron Brownstein wrote on October 10 for the Atlantic. “But the history of America’s experience with xenophobia indicates that Trump’s lurid attacks will only find a larger audience unless Harris, and others who believe in a more inclusive [globalist] society, challenge them more directly than they have so far.”

“There has been such a desire to tamp down the border debate [that] there’s been less of an ability to pivot to other parts of the immigration debate that could be helpful,” Carlos Odio, senior vice president for research at the polling firm Equis, told The Atlantic.

“Ignoring racist dog whistles … only makes them more potent … [and] voter sentiment about immigrants to grow more toxic,” progressive advocate Anat Shenker-Osorio complained in an October 20 article for Rolling Stone.

“Many left-learning immigrant advocacy groups have been calling for a media blitz or change in polling questions to help Americans see how mass deportations would devastate families,” Axios.com reported on October 22. “We have to tell that story, and not let Trump define immigration for our country,” activist Maria Rodriguez told Axios.

Harris’s Silence Strategy

Harris has built her campaign on women’s support for abortion, and she directly endorses radical pro-abortion policies, including opposition to rules that allow religious employees at medical centers to avoid participation in abortions:

Let’s just start with a fundamental fact, a basic freedom has been taken from the women of America: the freedom to make decisions about their own body. And that cannot be negotiable, which is that we need to put back in the protections of Roe v. Wade. And that is it.

But Harris is minimizing and mumbling her public advocacy for her unpopular pro-migration policies, even in interviews with Spanish-language media.

In media appearances, she deflects questions about her border policies by touting her support for the 2024 border bill drafted by Senate leaders and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK). “A typical sentence on immigration for Harris is Noun, verb, Lankford,” Brownstein said.

For example, she told NBC News on October 22:

What the immigration system needs, is it needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed in a number of ways that include bringing forth a bill that conservative members of Congress, along with others, pulled together, that we supported actively, that would put 1500 more border agents at the border … My proposal includes strengthening what we must do to ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration system and that we fix what has been bro- broken for a long time. It has transcended administrations, and it needs to be fixed.

But Harris is not touting migration and migrants in her bully pulpit speeches, and not using her campaign funds for a media blitz that portrays migrants in a favorable light. She’s not touting studies that claim economic benefits from migration, nor showcasing migrant children rescued from humanitarian disasters.

She has not even given swing voters even a token apology for her tacit support of Biden’s border breakdown, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. That apology might bring over a few voters, he added.

Her media allies also shield her from the public. For example, the media routinely describe the Lankford bill as “tough.” But the bill funded only minor border improvements. Worse, the supposed border security bill actually loosened asylum rules to give easy entry to millions of economic migrants, plus quick work permits and fast-track citizenship. “The border never closes,” boasted a leading Democrat senator.

Similarly, the media has said little about Harris’s renewed support for a 2021 mass-migration bill that never even got a vote in the Democrat-majority Congress. “The first [2021] bill … is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people,” Harris told Fox News on October 16.

Her support for the 2021 bill shows that Harris is escalating her pro-migration policies despite the huge national shift against those policies, Krikorian noted:

She used to just be talking about the [2024 Senate border] bill as the solution, but now she’s talking about the amnesty bill that they introduced in 2021 as the solution. That had no [border] enforcement in it at all. It was just a straight amnesty [and] increased immigration bill … She’s not only not met the public concern halfway, she’s doubled down on this [2021] bill that was even too extreme for the Democratic Congress in 2021 to even consider in committee

The 2021 bill would have amnestied many millions of illegal migrants, imported millions of additional contract workers for blue-collar and white-collar jobs sought by Americans, and opened the borders to many millions of chain-migration job-seekers, consumers, and renters.

Likewise, her media allies do not mention her migration record in the Senate, the high migration levels in her economic plans, her likely inflow of 12 million migrants, or the contradictions between her plan to build more homes for Americans and to import more migrants who want the same houses.

Tha migration silence strategy is working: 60 percent of Americans say Harris “hasn’t clearly explained her policies” on illegal immigration, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Her 60 percent is twice the 30 percent who say Trump has not explained his plans.

Moreover, polls show the public underestimates the inflow of economic migrants — largely because the media hides the numbers.

Her silence is welcomed by corporate-backed advocacy groups, the Washington Post reported October 6:

“The threat that Trump represents is existential, so the first order of business is to make sure that he gets defeated,” said Vanessa Cardenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice. “And come January, February of next year, we can have a conversation about the kind of policy interventions we’ll need, hopefully under a Harris administration.”

“We know, based on where she’s been in the past, that her policies are probably going to be aligned with UnidosUS’ policies,” said Carmen Feliciano, the advocacy chief for UnidosUS, a pro-migration group formerly named LaRaza.

“She can’t afford to look weak on the border if she wants to win,” Vox reported.

Harris’s only concession to popular opinion has been theatrical. “She just grudgingly went and had a picture of herself in front of Trump’s border fence,” Krikorian said. The clips from that brief event are being used in campaign ads that tout her supposedly “tough” border policies.

Meanwhile, her resentful progressive allies are ramping up the hate against Trump. The U.K. newspaper, the Guardian, for example, posted this claim about Trump’s plan to deport migrants:

It is a terrifying, horrifically immoral, and contemptibly bigoted proposal; racist, indifferent to humanity, and hostile to the principles of pluralism and equality. If it was enacted, it would be among the worst human rights catastrophes of all time.

The GOP, however, is keeping its popular migration policies in the news by forcing pro-migration journalists to cover the crises in cities, such as Springfield, Ohio, the toll of migrant crime, the economic burdens on Americans, the role of migration in housing costs, and the establishment’s legal contortions to favor migrants above Americans.

“What Donald Trump has proposed doing is we’re going to stop doing mass parole,” Sen. JD Vance said in Arizona on October 22, according to the New York Times. “We’re going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status … Of course, you’re going to have people fleeing from tyranny, but that happens on a case-by-case basis, not by waving the magic government wand.”

The Democratic Base

Harris’ silent strategy exists because Democrats cannot even pretend to move towards the center on immigration, Krikorian said, because the rank-and-file progressives and the major donors viscerally oppose the existence of Americans’ national borders:

De facto open[-borders] immigration is a litmus test issue now on the left. It is an irreducible value. Every interest group or constituency group on the left sacrifices its ostensible interests [once] they conflict with unlimited immigration. They can’t even compromise when the election outcome depends on it … [because] I it is unacceptable in the activist class on the left to have any doubts about mass immigration. [For donors and CEOs] I don’t think it’s just a matter of investors figuring “This is good for my bottom line.” Yes, it is. But those those guys at the top of big companies are emotionally and psychologically post-American already. Both their financial interest and their broader [post-American] worldview overlap here, so they think they’re doing good and they are happy they’re also doing well [economically].

“They see themselves as citizens of the world — [so they believe] immigration control is an atavistic and evil thing,” he added.

There is also much evidence that pro-migration investors have a tight hold on Harris’s campaign.

Harris’s campaign manager is David Plouffe, who took the Harris job while he was the chairman of the board at the nation’s most powerful pro-migration advocacy group, FWD.us.

The group was formed in 2013 by West Coast investors — led by Mark Zuckerberg — to push for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill. The lobbying is very rational because investors gain about $20 on the stock market for every $1 in profit generated by the government’s Extraction Migration policy of importing millions of wage-cutting workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries.

The breadth of investors who founded and funded FWD.us was hidden from casual visitors to the group’s website sometime in 2021. But copies exist at other sites.

Once the Gang of Eight bill was defeated in 2014 by the GOP’s primary voters in Virginia’s seventh district, FWD.us developed a long-term campaign to double the nation’s population growth via migration. The group prefers to downplay the alternative policy of doubling productivity via corporate investments.

It funded and boosted many state-level advocacy groups, pro-DACA demonstrations, law firms, media influencers, and PR campaigns by university officials and a business group for construction, retail, and energy companies. It helped elect Biden and put their ally Alejandro Mayorkas into the top job at the Department of Homeland Security — where he imported at least 10 million migrants from 2021 to 2024 amid a dramatic rise in migrants’ deaths, sex trafficking. and colonialism-like brain drains.

FWD.us also pushed the 2021 and 2024 bills that Harris is supporting.

The group’s top lobbyist, Andrea Flores, is now working for Plouffe in Harris’s campaign, according to Vox.

In an article for Foreign Affairs magazine, Flores urged Washington to quietly import millions of migrants via government-managed pathways:

With both the demand for and the number of immigrants set to remain extraordinarily high, the only way to reduce unauthorized migration is to … make legal immigration easier by increasing pathways for entry into the United States,

The public gets alarmed by images of migration at the border, so the government should also set up a network to quietly transport migrants to U.S. towns and workplaces, and also to support them until they are established.

Images of disorder in border towns … as well as the increased presence of new arrivals lacking housing or work permits in U.S. cities, escalated public concern about the visible disarray of the U.S. immigration system … leading to major operational challenges and political discord

Public disclosures and debates are making it difficult to bring in new migrants, she noted:

Years of chaos at the border have amplified xenophobia at a time when the U.S. economy needs immigrants more than ever. Around 55 percent of Americans now support curbing immigration to the United States.

That game plan matches Harris’s say-little campaign strategy in the 2024 election. It also shows who has the true power in the Democrats’ coalition of loud progressives and quiet investors.
Election chiefs from three important swing states recently went on cable news to make excuses about why they won’t have the election results on Election Day — even though this has been the norm in America for decades and is still the norm in many much larger states.

Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was asked Sunday on CBS News’ Face The Nation how “quickly” she expects to get the results, and she responded, in part, by saying: “I would estimate, end of the day on Wednesday [November 6], as the best guess on how we’ll perform.”

There is no good reason for such a delay, yet election officials in the post-Covid era are pushing the delays we saw during the 2020 election as the new norm.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who also joined the show on Sunday, said that because of a recently passed state law governing how elections are administered, “all early votes and all early accepted ballots, they all will have to have their results reported by 8pm. That’s 70, maybe even 75% of all the vote totals will be reported no later than 8pm on election night.”

So why can’t Georgia report its election results on election night? As Raffensperger said, the state “will be waiting for … overseas ballots that come in no later than Friday [that week], and so those will then be the final numbers. And we’ll just see if that makes the difference in the total vote totals.”

Why would Raffensperger feel the need to wait for what should be a minuscule number of overseas Georgia ballots to come in? Whatever the reason, the delay sows doubt and insecurity in the minds of American voters who are rightly accustomed to having results on Election Day.

Benson and Raffensperger aren’t alone in pushing to normalize delays. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Oct. 13 that, in light of controversy surrounding the time between polls closing and “races being called,” “[t]he message is please be patient” as “counties are working night and day to count their voters’ votes.”

The propaganda press is also working overtime to justify delays, downplaying concerns about incompetent election administration.

Newsweek recently published an analysis by Aron Solomon headlined “We’re Unlikely to Know the Winner on Election Night. That’s OK.” The piece argues “patience” is “essential in the modern electoral landscape,” and that while precedent for “decades” meant Americans could know the results by election night, this expectation “has become an increasingly unrealistic standard.” Solomon argues that the widespread use of mail-in ballots causes states to delay their vote totals.

But that excuse doesn’t hold water. The widespread use of mail-in ballots in the 2024 general election cycle may not be as widespread as 2020 and in fact, in a state like Georgia, might be closer to the rate of use in 2016 — when the election was called the night of.

In 2016, 241,519 absentee ballots were issued in the Peach State, according to Savannah Morning News. The 2016 race was called by the Associated Press at 11:33 p.m. on Election Night. The last day to request an absentee ballot in the state for the 2024 race is October 25, and WRDW reported Monday that “more than 200,000 Georgians have requested an absentee ballot” this election cycle. That’s about the same amount of ballots as in 2016, when we knew the winner in Georgia before midnight on Election Day. For reference, well over 1.5 million absentee ballots were requested in Georgia in 2020, according to data from the secretary of state.

Time Magazine published a piece in September to explain “Why We Might Not Know the Winner on Election Night.” The article similarly echoed the claims about mail-in votes presented in the Newsweek analysis.

Then there’s Axios, which said the “2024 election could take days to call,” just like 2020. We all remember what happened in 2020: Former President Donald Trump was up by 196,000 votes in Pennsylvania with just 12 percent of the vote still not counted, as Politico reported the day after Election Day. Days later, President Joe Biden would be declared the winner after mail-in ballots came flooding in, overwhelmingly in Biden’s favor.

CNN recently published an article headlined, “Election experts raise fresh alarms about vote counting delays – and chaos – in battleground states.” The piece argues that while Republicans might be up in the race initially, the results may later flip to elect a Democrat. Voters who are concerned about the delayed results are then smeared as helping promulgate what CNN describes as “false narratives about election fraud.”

What a change from just eight years ago, when disgraced reporter Jeffrey Toobin said in a short New York Times documentary about the 2000 election that “the one thing no one expected in a presidential campaign is that we wouldn’t know who won on Election Day.”

No one expected that in 2000 because even back then the expectation had long been that election results are known on Election Day, save for extremely rare circumstances.

As we enter the final leg of the election cycle, the left and its propaganda press allies are trying hard to downplay concerns about delayed election results, keeping voters in suspense while officials take days to announce outcomes that may change days after Election Day.

These delays understandably breed distrust in the electoral process, and pointing out that there’s no good reason for such delays doesn’t make you an “election denier” or a spreader of “false narratives about election fraud.” It rather shows that you’re paying attention, and that you’re right to think that our elections are not being conducted as freely or fairly as they should be.

Mobile apps, college football tailgates and Maryland lawmakers are all playing roles in conservatives’ strategy to turn out low-propensity voters in Pennsylvania and win the state for former President Donald Trump and down-ballot Republicans in November.

Pennsylvania is widely considered the most important swing state in former President Donald Trump’s bid to return to the White House, and the winner of the U.S. Senate race there could also determine the chamber’s balance of power. Trump lost Pennsylvania by approximately 81,000 votes in the 2020 race against President Joe Biden, but this time around Republicans are committed to ensuring a different outcome in the 2024 race by turning out voters who may lean toward Trump but may need an extra nudge to show up to the polls on election day.

These are voters who do not vote in every election, but may have interest in voting for Trump, either because they are drawn to his policies or because they are deeply unhappy with the results of the Biden-Harris administration’s agenda.

The campaign’s plan to target this specific sliver of the electorate is not a traditional one, but the underlying idea is that these individuals are more likely to swing the election if they vote for Trump than are hardcore conservatives who are absolutely committed to voting for the former president and other Republicans down the ballot. (RELATED: ‘The Timing Is Not Good’: Dem Strategist Sounds Alarm About Harris’ Chances In Crucial Commonwealth)

“There’s a lot of chatter from operatives and such saying, ‘Oh, nobody stopped at my door.’ If you’re a Republican political operative, we know who you’re going to vote for. We know that you know how to vote, and we know that you’re going to vote,” a Trump campaign official told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So what’s the point of making sure we send a door knocker out to your door when there’s 50 other people that we could be targeting that we don’t know for sure if they’ll vote, or know how to vote, or know what’s at stake?”

Cumberland County is one area where Republicans are putting their new strategy to the test. Republicans have politically dominated Cumberland County for decades, and Trump won it decisively in 2016 and 2020. However, Republicans on the ground say it is replete with the types of low-propensity voters who need to show up en masse for Trump to win the Keystone State.

The Daily Caller News Foundation spoke with nearly two dozen activists, volunteers, local GOP officials and Trump campaign officials on the ground in Cumberland County to learn more about the unorthodox plan that Republicans and conservative activists hope will deliver results on Nov. 5.

‘Get Out and Vote’

Apart from the Trump campaign, there is also an array of aligned third-party groups on the ground in Pennsylvania working to influence or mobilize all sorts of potential Trump voters. Those organizations include Elon Musk’s America PAC, Turning Point Action, Faith and Freedom Coalition and America First Works, among others.

It is too early to tell whether this strategy will pay dividends, or how the mail ballots are breaking for either party. However, Republican officials and volunteers on the ground in Cumberland County and beyond see changes in voter registration over the past several years as an encouraging indicator.

In the 2020 election cycle, there were about 660,000 more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, but that advantage has decreased to about 354,000 for the 2024 cycle, according to The Hill. The campaign and aligned groups have had success registering voters and recruiting volunteers at expressly political events like Trump rallies, volunteers told the DCNF, but they have also extended their reach to other types of well-attended events to get possible Trump supporters to cast votes.

Looking to register voters at college football tailgates is one of these “novel” approaches to mobilization that the campaign and other aligned groups have pursued, the Trump campaign staffer told the DCNF. At a tailgate ahead of Sunday night’s NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets, conservative activists affiliated with Turning Point Action managed to register about 50 Trump supporters, according to Turning Point’s Noah Formica, who has helped thousands of voters register in Pennsylvania since the start of this year.

Additionally, numerous volunteers and officials in Cumberland County told the DCNF that their anecdotal experiences indicate the energy and enthusiasm for Trump and other Republicans on the ground is robust and promising, though less tangible than voter registration data. The same goes for broad dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration’s record, particularly the inflation that is pinching ordinary Americans, including those who populate Cumberland County.

“I truly believe these efforts were not done in 2020, and they weren’t quite as established in 2016,” Michelle Nestor, a Cumberland County state committeewoman for the GOP, told the DCNF. “We knew that in 2016, it was going to be close, but people didn’t give up, and in the end, we had the red state that we need this time around.”

“We aren’t going to let 2020 happen again, because we have the numbers,” Nestor said. “Get out and vote, that is our priority. And everybody as a team has stepped up and volunteered time and time again for this effort, because we can’t have another Biden administration.” (RELATED: Hunters, Truckers And The Amish: Inside Republicans’ ‘Aggressive’ New Ballot-Chasing Plan For November)

Volunteers and Apps

The Trump campaign has more than two dozen field offices in the state, door-knocking and phone-banking programs and thousands of volunteers participating in “Trump Force 47,” an initiative for local organizers and politically-engaged citizens to make contact with lower-propensity voters and get them out to vote, the Trump campaign official told the DCNF.

Many volunteers — whether they are with “Trump Force 47” or not — are using several mobile apps to identify the low-propensity voters in their communities and approach them to gauge interest in voting for Trump, especially by mail.

Trump Force 47 volunteers are “all over” Cumberland County, Nestor — who is also a “Trump Force 47” volunteer — told the DCNF.

“I think it’s a fantastic strategy, because instead of having one person try to reach 1,000 people, or 10 people trying to reach 1,000, you’ve got 1,000 people reaching 10 each,” Sherri Chippo, deputy chair of the Cumberland County Republican Committee and a “Trump Force 47” volunteer, told the DCNF. “It makes it a lot easier, a lot more doable for those who want to help but say, ‘I can’t commit to such a huge effort, I need to do a little bit, and I can do that.’ So I love that strategy.”

While Chippo is admittedly not the biggest fan of voting by mail, “it’s the game that we’re playing now, and if we don’t get involved in early voting, then we miss out on voters” who may not make it to the polls on Election Day, she explained to the DCNF.

Approximately 921,000 people have returned early ballots in Pennsylvania as of Monday, with about 578,000 of those voters being registered as Democrats against nearly 254,000 early votes submitted by registered Republicans, according to data from the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s office. In total, the state has approved approximately 1,843,000 applications for early voters in the 2024 cycle, meaning that about 50% of approved early votes are still outstanding as of Monday.

Registered Republicans have so far managed to return about 254,000 early votes as of Monday, compared to the more than 580,000 early votes that registered Democrats have submitted to authorities statewide, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s data. In the 2020 race, registered Democrats returned just over 1.7 million ballots statewide, swamping the 623,000 or so that registered Republicans returned in that election cycle, according to the U.S. Elections Project’s analysis of data from the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s office.

John Cobb, a Cumberland County local, is at the tip of the spear of voter mobilization effort in the county. He described how he and his fellow organizers have persistently targeted lower-propensity voters to turn them out to vote for Trump, senate hopeful Dave McCormick, incumbent Republican Rep. Scott Perry and a bevy of other Republican candidates seeking local and state office.

“With those low-propensity Republicans, we’ve got two primary programs. One is a door knocking program, and one is a call from home program,” Cobb told the DCNF. “And so the door knocking program is focused completely on low-propensity Republicans and trying to sign them up for mail ballots. We’ve probably hit about 2,500 doors this year so far. We’ve got a regular team of 22 people that will knock doors. We’ve had as many as 28 or 30 people knocking doors, and we typically do it once a month, and we started in the summer.”

“If you’ve ever done door knocking, 80-90% of folks don’t answer the door. They’re not home, or they’re watching TV, or whatever, they just don’t answer the door,” Cobb said. “So out of that 10%, supposing we hit 2,500 total so far, we’ve had about 250 people open the door, and out of that we’ve gotten about 100 people to fill out the mail ballot applications and hand them to us. We then take the applications to the Bureau of Elections on their behalf to get them signed up for mail ballots, and we’re continuing that.”

Cobb and other organizers have also used mobile apps to their advantage to get out the low-propensity Republican vote in Cumberland County with phone calls and texts, an initiative he says has allowed them to contact about 2,000 people. Of that figure, close to 500 people in the county have signed up for mail ballots, and the organizers plan to then use that same system and strategy to chase the mail ballots in circulation to remind voters to submit them on time, he told the DCNF. About 88% of Republican mail ballots were ultimately submitted on time in 2023 elections in the county, and the organizers are aiming for a 95% rate in the 2024 elections, Cobb told the DCNF.

While not perfect, the various mobile apps in use on the ground are user-friendly and effective tools to efficiently identify and target the low-propensity slice of the Republican electorate that could play a large role in determining the winners and losers of the coming elections, several volunteers with firsthand experience using the apps told the DCNF.

The Cavalry

It’s not just Pennsylvania Republicans who are on the ground in the state’s southern regions to get the vote out for GOP candidates. State lawmakers, activists and volunteers from Maryland have also made several trips into southern Pennsylvania over the course of several weeks to reinforce Pennsylvania conservatives in the area, including one outing that featured about 20 current and former elected Maryland officials.

Maryland will not be a competitive state in the presidential race, and there are many thousands of Marylanders who have moved across the state line into Pennsylvania in pursuit of lower costs of living and a more favorable tax environment in recent decades, former Republican Maryland Gov. Bob Ehrlich told the DCNF.

Many of these people still commute to work in Maryland as police officers, firemen, nurses and other jobs, maintaining ties to the state despite moving away for greener pastures.

When the convoys from Maryland make their way up to Pennsylvania to assist, the former Marylanders who call the Keystone State home are often pleased to see them when they knock on doors and make contact, Republican Maryland State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza told the DCNF.

“We’ll talk, and we’ll recognize that they were from Maryland. And a lot of them will say, ‘We left Maryland because the tax policies that were in place and the cost of living was cheaper in Pennsylvania,’ but they still work in Maryland. A lot of them still go right down I-83 and work in Maryland,” Carozza told the DCNF. “Many have said, ‘Thanks for being here.’ And we have talked to them and met them in other places over the couple of times we’ve been here. And they’ve said, ‘Oh, we let somebody else know that there are some Maryland legislators up here and working and knocking on doors,’ and you can see that it has spread out a lot.”

Some of the current and former lawmakers who have made the trips north include Ehrlich, Maryland State Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey, former Maryland House of Delegates Minority Leader Ellen Sauerbrey, Republican State Sen. J.B. Jennings, and Republican Dels. Brian Chisholm, Chris Tomlinson and Tony Fulton. All were present in Cumberland County on Thursday to knock doors and get out the vote other than Fulton, who was delivering aid to Hurricane Helene victims in North Carolina.

Beyond simply encouraging voters to support Trump or oppose Vice President Harris at the polls, the reinforcements from Maryland also show up at voters’ doors with a simple message that resonates especially with Pennsylvanians still living with one foot in Maryland.

“One of the important messages we provided to many of the Pennsylvania residents when we were door knocking and making voter contact was ‘Don’t let Pennsylvania become the Maryland you moved away from,'” Hershey told the DCNF. “This really seemed to resonate with Pennsylvanian voters, especially the independents and unaffiliated registered voters.”

Republican Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst berated Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Wednesday for the Pentagon’s failure to properly ship military equipment to a key U.S. ally, which resulted in the equipment becoming seriously compromised.

The Pentagon made several shipments of military equipment to Taiwan between November 2023 and March, but because the shipments were not delivered properly, more than 67% of the equipment suffered water damage, according to a Department of Defense (DOD) watchdog report released in September. Ernst told Austin in a letter on Wednesday that the failure to ensure quality delivery was an “embarrassing debacle,” disrespectful to our ally and a waste of hundreds of thousands of U.S. taxpayer dollars, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: ‘Huge Concern’: Biden Admin, Harris Campaign Reportedly Worried That Middle East Conflict Hasn’t Ended Before Election)

“These failures are particularly alarming, not only because of Taiwan’s critical role as a key security partner but also because they could impact the confidence of other U.S. allies and partners that rely on timely and reliable defense support,” Ernst told Austin in the letter. “If such issues persist, they could erode trust in U.S. defense commitments globally, undermining the security relationships the U.S. has worked to strengthen.”

We found that the DoD did not effectively or efficiently implement accountability and quality controls for items delivered to Taiwan using the Presidential Drawdown Authority. Read our latest report: https://t.co/pbWEVzN3Oj pic.twitter.com/JZCwzowEN9 — DoD Office of Inspector General (@DoD_IG) September 12, 2024

Between November 2023 and March of this year, the Pentagon delivered 504 pallets worth of equipment to Taiwan, 340 of which suffered water damage during the shipment process, according to the DOD watchdog report. Approximately 120 of the pallets contained body armor plates and tactical vests that were covered in mildew and mold.

Taiwan had also claimed in December 2023 that it had received 2.7 million ammunition rounds from the Pentagon, some of which were expired or not packed properly, according to the watchdog report.

A breakdown in communications, lack of organization and failure to uphold quality standards resulted in the compromised shipments, according to the report. It cost over $730,000 to clean or replace the equipment.

“This situation presents not only operational risks for Taiwan but also a broader strategic risk to U.S. credibility… these failures could severely undermine Taiwan’s confidence in the United States at a time when the region faces growing security challenges,” Ernst wrote to Austin. “With ongoing tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. cannot afford to weaken its commitments or lose the trust of critical partners and allies.”

Ernst demanded that Austin answer what steps were taken to ensure similar equipment shipments to U.S. allies meet quality standards, what oversight measures are in place during the delivery process and where the $730,000 spent on cleaning and replacements was sourced from.

In a separate document obtained by the DCNF, Ernst’s office drew a contrast between the “international incompetence” of the Biden-Harris administration’s move to send shoddy equipment to Taiwan while American adversaries around the globe enjoy profits under the administration’s policies. Specifically, Ernst’s office pointed to the administration’s decision to send over $1 billion to a U.N. Palestinian agency linked to terrorism and leave $7 billion worth of military equipment behind for the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2021.

Ernst gave her monthly “Squeal Award” to the Pentagon in October, a sarcastic award meant to call out government agencies for wasting money, according to the document obtained by the DCNF.

“The Biden-Harris administration sent equipment that a thrift shop wouldn’t accept and ammunitions that are as lethal as an unloaded water gun to a key partner in the crosshairs of Communist China,” Ernst told the DCNF. “This amateur-hour incompetence by the White House is exactly why the world is on fire.”

Former President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist David Axelrod warned on his podcast Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent appearances with former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney could backfire due to how their conversations come across to the average voter.

Cheney kicked off a three-day tour with Harris on Monday in Michigan, urging Republican voters in the key battleground state to back Harris on issues like abortion. On “Hack on Tap,” Axelrod noted that while Harris seemed to be targeting ‘Never Trump’ Republicans with Cheney’s help, he questioned whether their events would resonate with voters concerned about the economy.

“The voters you’re talking about are high-information voters, and I think if they are motivated by this, they are already highly motivated, and I don’t know how much there’s left in that well. I think the voters who are mostly hanging out are younger voters, lower-information voters who are very much concerned about the economy — I think I said that earlier,” Axelrod said. “I think that the more populist arguments that she’s been making about the middle class and about, ‘I’m for you, he’s for him,’ I think maybe more motivational for those particular voters.”

“So I watched Liz Cheney, who — I agree with everything I heard last night. I watched one of the forums in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney … but I have to say someone texted me in the middle of it and said, ‘This sounds like a conversation you’d hear in first class.’ And I thought that was a pretty good observation, and it isn’t the people in first class who may be deciding this election. So that worries me a bit,” Axelrod added.

Axelrod continued by expressing a second concern, noting that voters may still have “questions” about Harris. He urged the campaign to adopt a more “contrast mode” between her and former President Donald Trump. (RELATED: ‘He’s Not Helping’: Ex-CNN Analyst Says Biden’s Call To ‘Lock’ Trump ‘Up’ Is ‘Absolutely Bad For Kamala Harris’)

“The second thing that worries me is, I don’t think they’ve — I think that people have made a judgment about Donald Trump. If this is — if it were just an up-or-down referendum on Donald Trump, I don’t think he’d get elected, and he still butts up against his ceiling, which is under 50%,” Axelrod continued. “The questions they have are about her because she’s brand new, and they haven’t completely … so I would be more in the contrast mode between her and him. I’d give them a little more information about her, probably around middle-class economics and basically being a battler for them, and around abortion rights. I would be doing contrast, contrast, contrast.”

Voters have consistently ranked the economy, inflation, and immigration as their top concerns heading into November. After Harris was announced as the Democratic presidential nominee, she reportedly tried to distance herself from President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings were low due to his handling of these issues.

However, Harris faced criticism in early October when she failed to distinguish herself from Biden, telling ABC’s “The View” that “not a thing” came to mind when asked if she would change anything about the last four years of the Biden administration. Harris also stumbled during a Tuesday evening NBC interview, claiming her economic plan was resonating with voters, despite being confronted by the host about Trump leading on the issue.

Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of far-left propaganda outlet The Atlantic, published an article Tuesday with glaring fabrications about former President Donald Trump’s interactions with the families of fallen service members and his outlook on military leadership.

Goldberg’s dishonest hit piece is the latest in a long line of far-left outlets lying and deceiving the American people before a major election.

Mayra Guillén, the sister of fallen soldier Vanessa Guillén, whose family was featured as proof in Goldberg’s piece, slammed the outlet and Goldberg for exploiting her sister’s death.

“Wow. I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics — hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members,” Mayra stated. “President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today.”

Mayra’s comments come after Goldberg claimed that Trump displayed “contempt, rage, parsimony, racism” at the thought of helping the Guillén family pay for Vanessa’s funeral. Vanessa was bludgeoned to death by another soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, and her family was invited to the Oval Office to meet with Trump. Her death was also the impetus for military reforms for women at bases at the state and federal levels.

According to Goldberg’s article, upon hearing that the funeral cost $60,000, Trump said, “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f-cking Mexican!” and told Mark Meadows, his chief of staff at the time, “Don’t pay it!” The Guillén family is of Mexican origin.

While Goldberg’s claims are sourced by “contemporaneous notes” and “a witness,” they were disputed publicly by senior members of the Trump administration who were actually in the room at the time of the alleged incident.

“Any suggestion that President Trump disparaged Ms. Guillen or refused to pay for her funeral expenses is absolutely false,” Meadows said on social media. “He was nothing but kind, gracious, and wanted to make sure that the military and the U.S. government did right by Vanessa Guillen and her family.”

Goldberg’s smear piece is in line with his 2020 lie, the “suckers and loser” hoax that was also heavily rebutted by nearly everyone involved, which he originated late in the election season as well. Conveniently, Democrats have since been rolling that hoax out every time Trump mentions the military, as they did again in the aftermath of Trump attending the Arlington National Cemetery ceremony.

As my colleague Jordan Boyd wrote, “Nearly two dozen Trump White House officials debunked the hit piece, which only received ‘confirmation’ from one source outside of Goldberg.” In the same way, Goldberg’s newest screed is thinly sourced and relies on anonymous testimony while ignoring or devaluing on-the-record statements.

Goldberg also appears to have invented out of thin air a denial from Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson, saying that Meadows “denied having heard Trump make the statement.” In reality, Meadows said Trump “absolutely did not say that.”

On the left: I sent Atlantic a comment saying President Trump “absolutely did not say that,” referring to the alleged comments about Ms. Guillen they printed.



On the right: Atlantic translated that comment to “didn’t hear Trump say it.”

“More disgusting lies from the media,” Kash Patel, former Pentagon chief of staff, posted on social media. “I was there, this is the actual truth, from the family of the fallen, @realDonaldTrump put them first, like he always does with our service members: America Always.”

Goldberg even included a statement Patel in his article, but published the apparent fabrications, anyway.

“As someone who was present in the room with President Trump during that meeting on December 4, he strongly urged that Spc. Vanessa Guillen’s grieving family should not have to bear the cost of any funeral arrangements, even offering to personally pay himself in order to honor her life and sacrifice,” Patel’s statement to Goldberg said. “In addition, President Trump was able to have the Department of Defense designate her death as occurring ‘in the line of duty,’ which gave her full military honors and provided her family access to benefits, services, and complete financial assistance.”

Theo Wold, yet another official who was actually in the room came out publicly to debunk Goldberg’s claims, saying “[Mayra] was poised and confident in advocating for her sister then and she’s right again today: The Atlantic hit piece is a lie.”

“I was at President Trump’s meeting with the Guillén family because I assisted with translation that day. President Trump was genuinely concerned about Vanessa Guillén and appalled by the tragedy the Guillén Family were enduring,” said Wold, former acting assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice and deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy. “For example, President Trump had zero interest in the cameras. He met with the Guillén family privately for twenty minutes and offered the press gaggle solely if it would assist them in honoring Army Specialist Guillén and raising awareness about her case.”

“He even told them that day that the press are vipers,” Wold concluded. “Boy was President Trump right.”

The Trump campaign also denied the “f-cking Mexican” comment, which was included in Goldberg’s diatribe: “President Donald Trump never said that. This is an outrageous lie from The Atlantic two weeks before the election,” Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump campaign adviser, said.

Goldberg then turned to more unnamed sources, apparently “two people who heard [Trump] say,” “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had.” Pfeiffer once again denied the comment: “This is absolutely false. President Trump never said this.”

Attempting to trash Trump further, Goldberg randomly asserted that “Trump has frequently voiced his disdain for those who serve in the military and for their devotion to duty, honor, and sacrifice. Former generals who have worked for Trump say that the sole military virtue he prizes is obedience. As his presidency drew to a close, and in the years since, he has become more and more interested in the advantages of dictatorship, and the absolute control over the military that he believes it would deliver.”

As one would expect from propagandists like Goldberg, that assertion takes at face value Democrat fearmongering talking points about “dictatorship,” rhetoric that has been tied to the two assassination attempts on Trump.

Goldberg’s propaganda, however, is completely in step with the publication he works for. The Atlantic is owned by far-left funder Laurene Powell Jobs, who has “built out a well-funded network designed to explicitly advance the policy goals of the Democratic Party,” as The Federalist’s Mark Hemingway reported. In addition, The Atlantic formally endorsed Harris for president earlier this month.

Goldberg’s comment about Trump’s “disdain” for the military becomes nearly impossible to believe when read in the context of how Mayra Guillén and other Gold Star families have spoken of Trump.

Notably, the Gold Star families whose loved ones perished at the Abbey Gate during the Biden administration’s disastrous and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan invited Trump to attend a service honoring the fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery.

Despite the onslaught of criticism Vice President Kamala Harris unleashed in her attempt to play politics with the deaths of 13 service members at the Abbey Gate, many family members slammed the Biden administration for having gotten their children “murdered,” due to their incompetence.

In contrast, the Abbey Gate Gold Star families note Trump’s generosity.

“Trump has reached out when the current admin ignores Gold Star Families,” Christy Shamblin, mother-in-law of Sergeant Nicole Gee, said. “I’ve grown to know him as approachable, honest, knowl[edge]able about our veterans and above all strong in his belief that our armed service members are the finest the world has and deserve to be treated accordingly.”

Coral Dolittle, mother of Corporal Humberto Sanchez, said, “People often ask me why I support Donald Trump. The answer is simple. Media outlets and social media often portray him as heartless and indifferent, especially toward the military. However, after meeting the man behind the name, I saw a different side of him. Donald Trump is caring, compassionate, and has shown our military families how much he genuinely cares about us, our children, and our grief.”

Adding insult to injury with regard to Goldberg’s checkered reporting past in recent years, he is also a major progenitor of the lies that brought the United States into the Iraq War — which destroyed our military for a generation — again on the backs of unnamed sources.

He did this, as Sohrab Ahmari pointed out in the New York Post, essentially at the behest of “pro-regime-change figures, American and Iraqi.”

Vice President Kamala Harris’ pop culture-centered, policy avoidant campaign paints a telling picture of the low regard in which the Democratic Party views young women.

Despite being the second-in-command of an administration that enacted an executive order allowing biological males to enter women’s private spaces and supporting a California proposition that categorizes rape of an incapacitated person as “nonviolent,” Harris has centered much of her campaign around being a feminist folk hero. With her Clinton-esque pantsuit girlboss persona and promise to keep the evil orange villain from turning America into the Republic of Gilead, she has won the hearts and minds of many women in the over 35 crowd. With Gen Z and younger millennial women, it is not so easy. For many of us, she is reminiscent of an awkward college English professor trying to relate to students with an outdated playlist of “girl power” anthems and years-old memes in her PowerPoints.

With young people, Harris had an opportunity to make her campaign one of substance. She could have outlined tangible policy and plans for her presidency regarding how to prevent us from inheriting an economy in which it is growing increasingly difficult to provide for oneself, let alone start a family. (Although, as vice president, she was already in a position to do something on these issues the past four years.) She could have presented foreign and climate policy talking points addressing growing fears of coming of age in a world rife with armed conflict and natural disaster.

Instead, she invited social media influencers to the Democratic National Convention and appeared on a sex podcast while Americans were dying in a hurricane. Her campaign proves the Democratic Party believes young women are as vapid and easily distracted by shiny objects as their leading lady.

Being ‘Brat’

Let’s break down Kamala’s attempts at being hip with the cool girls. In early June, British pop singer Charli XCX released her album “Brat.” Most easily recognized by the title printed in Arial font on a Shrek-colored background, “Brat” became a cultural phenomenon. Summer 2024 was quickly declared “Brat Summer.” Suddenly, everyone wanted to be “brat.”

So, what does “brat” even mean? According to Charli XCX herself, “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes. Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like, parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” On a cultural level, “brat” is a social rebellion against the ruling “clean girl” and “old money” aesthetics that espouse sophistication, discipline, and tastefulness. However, the cultural quickly became political.

As soon as President Joe Biden announced that he was stepping out of the 2024 race and endorsed Harris, Charli XCX tweeted “Kamala is Brat.” Punch drunk on cultural relevance, Harris underwent a rebranding. The vice president’s X background quickly turned the same green as the “Brat” album cover, with “Kamala HQ” written in Arial font. Several of her team’s TikTok videos included a song from the album in the background. Influencers danced to songs dubbed with Harris’ more agonizing phrases including, “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you” and “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?”

During a summer in which intelligence officials warned of imminent terrorist attacks and a report indicated government complacency in the trafficking of minors at the border, Harris was preoccupied with a Brit giving her unsolicited opinion on American politics. Additionally, why on earth would anyone want the leader of the free world to be “brat?” I, for one, do not want a president who identifies with being “messy” and saying “dumb things sometimes.” Perhaps Harris doesn’t even identify with the phrase and hopes fad-based campaigning will give her a seat at the cool kids’ table.

Locker-Room Talk

Earlier this month, Appalachia was devastated by Hurricane Helene, with at least 230 people killed. Many more lost their homes, belongings, electricity, and access to running water. Both the morally correct and politically savvy choice for Harris was to be on the ground, showing support and assisting in providing aid to those in this historically red voting region. But that would have required both empathy for the common person and a semblance of intellectual competency, two traits of which this presidential hopeful is tragically devoid. Instead, she appeared on a podcast described as “female locker room talk.” Run by party-girl-turned-fourth-wave-feminist Alexandra Cooper, “Call Her Daddy” provides young women with advice including “cheat or be cheated on” and how to perform oral sex on a man.

Harris spent a large portion of the podcast stoking hysteria around the topic of abortion. I will give credit where credit is due. Harris said she became a prosecutor after watching her high school friend suffer the traumatic effects of a sexual assault. The epidemic of violence against women is pervasive. Almost every woman knows at least one person who has survived a sexual assault, if she hasn’t survived one herself. However, any credibility dissipates with Harris, given that her policies on crime and stance on the Second Amendment and gender ideology all but declare an open season on women. If Harris cared so much about women, why is she on a podcast that once interviewed a man who referred to women as “holes?” Maybe she doesn’t care about anybody but herself and is willing to act the fool if it will win her the election.

Young women are not “brat” and we certainly are not buying what Harris is selling. Most of my peers are intelligent, resilient, and often witty women with a desire to be a catalyst for positive change. We not only came of age but thrived in a time where we are expected to pretend that men are women, jihadi terrorists are victims, and we are selfish if we do not want to sacrifice our social interaction, economic future, and possibly our fertility to quell the fears of the paranoid.

Harris’ campaign strategy insinuates that young women are not empowered and informed voters deserving of a politician earning our votes. Instead, we are airheads incapable of independent thought and only able to be reached by celebrity endorsements and consequence-free unprotected sex.

I will not tell you whom to vote for, because, unlike our vice president, I believe that you are capable of thinking for yourself. However, I will share the advice a friend gave me almost a decade ago after I was snubbed by my high school crush: When somebody shows what they think of you, believe them.

The only logical way to interpret the far-left Atlantic’s latest piece of fake news is as a clarion call for someone to assassinate former President Trump before Election Day.

Keep in mind that under the ownership of Laurene Powell Jobs, who just so happens to be one of Vice President Kamala Harris’s largest donors, the Atlantic has become nothing less than a Democrat Party super PAC. And now that it looks like Trump could win the 2024 presidential election, the Atlantic has entered a much darker place.

Laurene Powell Jobs and her toady editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg aren’t even being subtle in their latest hit piece, which can only be interpreted one way: Won’t someone please kill this racist Nazi before Election Day?

Nothing else makes sense.

There is no other way to interpret this.

First off, within moments of its release, the Atlantic story was not only debunked and disputed, it was thoroughly discredited by those who were there.

The Atlantic laughably claims that after offering to pay for the funeral of U.S. Army soldier Vanessa Guillen in December 2020, and later being told the price tag was $60,000, then-President Trump lost it in a fit of racism. From my colleague Kristina Wong’s report:

The Atlantic claimed, citing “attendees” and “contemporaneous notes” of the meeting taken by “a participant,” that an aide told Trump the funeral cost $60,000, to which the outlet claimed that Trump “became angry” and said, “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a fucking Mexican!” and turned to his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and issued an order: “Don’t pay it!” The outlet claimed that Trump later in the day — according to a “witness,” said, “Fucking people, trying to rip me off.”

Except, this very same Mark Meadows says it never happened.

“I was in the discussions featured in the Atlantic’s latest hit piece against President Trump. Let me say this. Any suggestion that President Trump disparaged Ms. Guillen or refused to pay for her funeral expenses is absolutely false,” Meadows posted on Xwitter. “He was nothing but kind, gracious, and wanted to make sure that the military and the U.S. government did right by Vanessa Guillen and her family.”

Mayra Guillen, the sister of the dead soldier, was even more outraged by the article.

“Wow. I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics – hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members,” Guillen xweeted. “President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today.”

Natalie Khawan, the Guillen’s lawyer, also publicly called the Atlantic and Goldberg liars.

“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg @the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” she xweeted.

Additional sources who were in the room also refuted the story and have done so publicly and on the record.

That’s not even the worst of it. This story’s headline is (I don’t link fake news or stories that incite murder) “Trump: ‘I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had.’” The sub-headline reads: “The Republican nominee’s preoccupation with dictators, and his disdain for the American military, is deepening.”

This comes just days after this beauty in the Atlantic by neocon fascist Anne Applebaum: “Trump Is Speaking Like Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini.”

Riddle me this…

Why would the Atlantic publish a story that they knew would be immediately discredited by the very players named in the story?

Think about that…

Laurene Powell Jobs and Jeffrey Goldberg might be evil, but they are not dumb. They had to have known the “Trump: ‘I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had’” story would blow up in their faces the moment it published because people like Mark Meadows and Mayra Guillen and Natalie Khawan would call them out.

Do you see what I’m getting at here…?

This story is the equivalent of a suicide bomb aimed at Trump. The Atlantic is so desperate to see Trump murdered that Jobs and Goldberg shamelessly sacrificed their own credibility.

You see, the unbalanced, seething-with-hatred Trump assassins Jobs and Goldberg are hoping to motivate won’t care about the denials or even the truth. They will only see what the Atlantic’s confederates in the pro-murder-Trump media want them to see: “fucking Mexican” and “Hitler.”

You don’t publish blatant lies like this, especially after two assassination attempts, unless you want Trump murdered.

You don’t brazenly blow up your own credibility like this unless you want Trump murdered.

The Atlantic is not alone. CNN and Politico have both brazenly cried out for Trump’s assassination.

Black voters shocked MSNBC host Alex Wagner when they questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ authenticity.

“The first time I ever heard the name Kamala Harris,” said a woman named Dr. Alfie Goodwin, “it was in association to locking up parents for truancy.”

“I really didn’t understand how this person claims to be a black woman, but yet she’s locking up black women and black men and separating families.”

Gold MSNBC segment on Philly voters: "At the end of the day, I don't think Kamala has what it takes to go up against Putin — and go up against these other presidents that are built for this… I want my president to feel secure, and manly, and ABOUT IT." pic.twitter.com/3SI4elmOG0 — johnny maga (@_johnnymaga) October 23, 2024

Harris made her crackdowns on truancy as a local prosecutor in San Francisco a top pitch to voters while running for California attorney general. When she was inaugurated following her first statewide election, Harris made clear, “We are putting parents on notice. If you fail in your responsibility to your kids, we are going to work to make sure you face the full force and consequences of the law.”

Harris was attacked for her aggressive initiatives on truancy in 2019 when she mounted her first run for president.

“The dispute over the truancy policy, which was later expanded statewide with Harris’s support, illustrates a broader issue for her,” Vox reported just weeks after Harris announced her presidential primary campaign. “Policies that may have seemed acceptable or even laudable a decade ago face more questions today as criminal justice reform has taken off, especially among Democrats, particularly in the wake of Black Lives Matter.”

Harris would go on to struggle with courting black voters throughout her party’s 2020 presidential primary for reasons some voters would reiterate on MSNBC Tuesday night.

“When she was sworn into the Senate, it was as the first American Indian,” Goodwin said, met with a “Thank you!” from a nearby listener. “It’s fine! We don’t care,” Goodwin added, with MSNBC cutting to another voter named Valerie Martin who said, “We all know she’s not black!”

“Let’s understand that,” Martin said. “We are all clear of that.”

“But my point of view,” she added, is “she’s already been there. She’s in office right now.”

Black voters had resisted flocking to Harris in 2020, citing her heritage as Jamaican and Indian instead of African American. The Washington Post reported in 2019 on left-wing influencers who explained her lineage as the reason behind black resistance to backing a Harris candidacy.

“You don’t voluntarily immigrate into a community that is supposedly segregated, and then claim the struggles of people who have been here chained to chattel slavery for multiple generations,” one activist named Antonio Moore said on his radio show. “Kamala Harris does not have a black agenda.”

“Moore is a leader of a tiny but outspoken movement called American Descendants of Slavery, or ADOS, which has been rattling Democratic strategists and enraging some liberal black leaders by calling for a reimagining of black identity that replaces skin color with historical lineage as the defining characteristic,” the Post reported. “Descendants of American slaves, they say, should not be seen as part of broader groups like ‘people of color’ or ‘minorities,’ because their historical situation is completely different.”

Trump was hounded by the press after referencing similar sentiments in his remarks at a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) this summer.

“I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,” Trump said in Chicago. “Is she Indian or is she black?”

As The Federalist has reported, the Harris campaign has exploited the most racist impulses of identity politics to gin up faux outrage against Trump. In August, the Democrat’s campaign ridiculed a Trump stop in the Detroit suburb of Howell, Michigan, a city in a reliably red county surrounded by blue votes that Republicans obviously hope to flip.

Trump’s event on “crime and safety,” however, according to the Harris campaign, wasn’t just a “dog whistle” from the Republican, but a “bullhorn.”

Alyssa Bradley, the Harris campaign’s Michigan communications director, condemned Trump for “choosing to rally in a town that was historically known as ‘the KKK capital of Michigan.'” A reporter asked Trump about the charge of white supremacy, citing the presence of area extremists at the tail end of the event. The former president responded by asking the reporter a question of his own.

“Who was here in 2021?” Trump said.

“Joe Biden,” she answered.

“Thank you,” Trump responded before walking off.

Trump doubled his share of the black vote from 6 percent to 12 percent in the last election, and some polls suggest the Republican president could do so again this year.
The Badger State’s troubled election regulator continues to have a transparency problem.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) is facing possible court intervention for its refusal to turn over records related to guidance that WEC issued to local election clerks about same-day registration safeguards.

According to a lawsuit filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), the commission issued updated guidance in February 2023, but has stonewalled PILF’s records requests seeking communications about the creation of the guidance for “at least 397 days.”

“Same-Day Voter Registration is already a vote now verify later system,” J. Christian Adams, president of the election integrity watchdog, said in a statement. “Wisconsin is adding more uncertainty to its election process by hiding election records. Wisconsin needs to be subject to the federal election transparency law. Concealing the election process from the public encourages disinformation and distrust.”

Wisconsin is one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that allows voters to register and cast a ballot on the same day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Individuals registering to vote on Election Day in Wisconsin must present acceptable photo ID.

While leftist voting activists say same-day registration bolsters voter turnout, election integrity advocates argue the allowance opens the door to election administration chaos and fraud.

‘Matters of Great Public Importance’

Same-day voter registration does come with mandatory safeguards in the Badger State, including a review or audit to determine the validity of the same-day registrant’s address. Election officials must identify which registrations should be inactivated and referred to law enforcement for investigation of voter fraud.

After each election, WEC is required to mail postcards to all voters who used same-day registration. If the postcards are returned to local clerk offices as “undeliverable,” election officials must investigate the failed return. If they cannot identify a delivery problem within the U.S Postal Service or a typo in the address in need of correction, clerks are required to inactivate the voter name and refer the matter to the local district attorney for further investigation.

According to the lawsuit, the Elections Commission in February 2023 issued the updated guidance to local clerks, describing the “circumstances under which clerks should and should not cancel voter registration records and circumstances under which clerks should and should not refer registrants to district attorneys for further investigation.”

“The Guidance thus concerns the right to vote and election crimes, matters of great public importance,” PILF states in its petition for a writ of mandamus, asking the Dane County judge to order WEC to release the requested records.

‘Public Records System was Failing’

PILF’s Logan Churchwell sent a public records request on Sept. 15, 2023 seeking the records, the lawsuit states. He sought copies of communications between WEC and local clerks, communications between the commission and legislative offices “regarding the development and execution of the guidance to date,” and communications between the regulator and nongovernmental organizations and third parties about the guidance.

While Churchwell received a rapid acknowledgement from the agency that it had received his records request, the foundation received no further communication. Nearly a month later, Churchwell asked for an update. Silence. Two weeks later, he sent another request for an update on the status of his filing. WEC failed to respond again. In mid-November, PILF received an email from a commission attorney, who said the “public records system was failing to send message alerts to appropriate staff,” according to the complaint. The WEC attorney advised Churchwell to communicate with him via his WEC email but advised that the agency had a backlog of more than 60 requests and the foundation’s was toward the back of the line. The attorney also wanted PILF to include more information in its request, although such information is not required under state open records law, the complaint states.

Near the end of the year, the commission finally responded with preliminary results showing nearly 7,300 “responsive” documents, or records that were relevant to PILF’s requests. But the delays and stonewalling, the complaint notes, went on and on.

“As of the date of this Petition, WEC has failed to fulfill the Foundations’ Request, deny the Request, explain its delay, ask for further clarification, or provide an update or a timeline for responding,” the lawsuit states.

Wisconsin’s open records law makes clear that “[e]ach authority, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority’s determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor.”

“[C]ompliance at some unidentified time in the future, is not authorized by the open records law,” the statute states.

The lawsuit argues that because WEC has failed to fulfill the request or explain why it cannot in a timely fashion, PILF is entitled under law to “bring an action for mandamus asking the court to order release” of the records.

‘This is Bad’

As The Federalist reported earlier this year, the foundation filed a separate federal lawsuit against Wisconsin’s special exemption from the National Voter Registration Act’s public disclosure provision. The lawsuit alleges the carveout for Wisconsin violates the principle of equal state sovereignty and should be declared invalid.

In April, PILF filed a complaint alleging Green Bay’s city clerk, Celestine Jeffreys, ignored laws aimed at detecting abuse of the Badger State’s same-day registration process. Jeffreys ultimately acknowledged that “she has not been strictly adhering to the statutory requirements in Wisconsin Statutes … but the failure to do so was inadvertent and due to a lack of awareness of the statutory requirements.”

In other words, she didn’t understand the law on vetting same-day voter registrants that she is obliged to follow.

“This is bad,” said Lauren Bowman Bis, PILF’s director of communications, told The Federalist in May. “People need to have faith and trust in their elected officials. For her to not be following the law, not even knowing the law, … is unbelievable.” She added that Jeffreys’ failure to inactivate the individuals on the undeliverable list “could be easily used for fraud and abuse.”

“It’s not often you have an elected official admit she doesn’t know the law,” the spokeswoman said. “Wisconsin is a critical state [in the 2024 election] … This doesn’t just affect the people in Green Bay or Wisconsin. We all want faith in our elections, that the rules are being followed. In Green Bay, that’s not the case.”

Jeffreys has a history of trouble with election law. In December, the state elections commission found that Jeffreys violated election law in the 2022 spring election when she accepted multiple absentee ballots brought in on behalf of voters.

Former President Trump called out former President Obama for "sabotaging" President Biden's 2024 re-election bid, arguing the move was unprecedented in the history of American politics.

Trump called into "The Brian Kilmeade Show" on Fox News Radio to discuss what many critics consider Biden's ousting instigated by Democratic colleagues and other key issues that matter to constituents as early voting is underway in all 50 states.

Kilmeade asked Trump for his reaction to Obama's recent remarks at a Harris campaign rally. Obama took credit for the strong economy during Trump's term, arguing it "was my economy."

PELOSI REPORTEDLY NOT ‘HAPPY THAT THE ONLY BLOODY FINGERPRINTS ON THE KNIFE’ TO OUST BIDEN WERE HERS

"What he did to Biden was pretty incredible," Trump told Kilmeade. "I watched the way he led him off the stage. And I will say what he did to Biden, I think it was really terrible. They sabotaged Biden, but whether you like Biden or not, he won the nomination and then they took it away from him, and there's never been a time — there's never been a time where that's happened."

Biden dropped out of the 2024 race in July, following a dismal debate performance against Trump in June. This paved the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic Party's nominee, whom the president eventually endorsed.

"She's worse than him," Trump warned. "I really believe that. I think she'll be actually worse than him," he said, issuing stark concerns about the Biden-Harris administration's approach to global affairs.

Meanwhile, voters across the nation are casting their ballots early in all 50 states.

The former president touted turnout thus far in key swing states like North Carolina and Georgia, which are both pivotal in paving the way for a potential election win.

"Early voting has been extraordinary so far," Trump said. "I would say beyond our wildest expectation, if you look at North Carolina, you look at Georgia… I think the Atlanta paper came out with about a five, four or five-point spread already that we're leading, and we're doing — we seem to be doing very well in early voting, But who knows?"

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

"We have to get it. You have to get it over the top," he continued. "There's great enthusiasm."

Trump told Kilmeade that he would be voting early in Florida.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 1.8 million of Georgia’s some 7.2 million active voters cast absentee or early in-person ballots, or 25.2%, shattering previous pre-Election Day records.

Georgia has seen surging early voter numbers , but is not the only state breaking records — both North Carolina and South Carolina broke their previous Day 1 thresholds, according to local reports.

Both presidential candidates will also be in Georgia this week. Harris will be in Atlanta on Thursday alongside Obama, while Trump will participate in multiple events on Wednesday.

The former president will partake in a religious event in rural Georgia on Wednesday, according to WRBL, followed by an evening rally in Duluth.

"I haven't taken a day off in 52 days, and now I have 13 [days left], and [Harris is] sleeping today," Trump said. "She's like Biden, likes to sleep a lot… I have not taken days off at all, nor should I… This is the big thing."

"This is going to make America great again. We can't take a chance," he continued. "If we don't win this race, our country is in serious jeopardy."

The Brief Long lines and hours-long wait times, the first day of early in-person voting in Wisconsin kicked off with a hitch on Tuesday, Oct. 22. The Wisconsin Elections Commission said the voter turnout was higher than expected, causing its system to lag and it has since been resolved. Racine and Port Washington said they encountered slow times for printing labels, while Kenosha County said they had no issues to report.



Long lines and hours-long wait times, the first day of early in-person voting in Wisconsin kicked off with a hitch on Tuesday, Oct. 22.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission said the voter turnout was higher than expected, causing its system to lag. The lag has been resolved. However, that was after the processing delays and some people waiting for hours.

In exchange for a seat at the table, Glendora Shaw, broken femur and all, brought a chair to conquer this long line at the Capitol Drive early voting center.

"Our lives are at stake," Shaw said. "Nothing was going to stop me, that's why I’m here in the chair."

Inside, the lines were even longer for the first day of in-person early voting for the 2024 presidential election.

"Three hours, I been in line so long," said Peggy Woodard, another Milwaukee voter. "I felt like I was going to pass out, so I got a chair."

The WEC released a statement, saying in part:

"The WisVote System that some clerks use experienced a period of slowness that has now been resolved" and adding "today's system lag was purely related to demands on the WisVote System due to a high turnout."

Glendale Mayor Bryan Kennedy said the system crash caused a line to form out the door.

"This is kind of unusual," Kennedy said. "What we explained to folks is when the state database goes down we can’t issue you a ballot at that moment because we can’t guarantee if you’ve already gotten an absentee ballot so we can’t give you a second ballot obviously."

But voters were not discouraged.

"I wanted to make sure I had a chance to vote before the 5th because you never know what’s going to happen," said Glendale voter Faye Hantsche.

"Everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing. People are taking this very, very seriously. This is a serious matter," said Cathy Wanzo, another voter.

Racine and Port Washington said they encountered slow times for printing labels, while Kenosha County said they had no issues to report.

Statement from Mayor Cavalier Johnson

"Milwaukee voters cast 4,761 ballots on the first day of early voting. That number reflects an enthusiasm about this fall's elections and is an encouraging sign that this city's voice will be heard in the local, statewide, and national races.

"I thank all the Milwaukee election workers for their efforts, and I especially thank the thousands of voters who turned out yesterday. I encourage all eligible voter to consider casting their ballots at one of the city's ten early voting sites. More information on voting in Milwaukee is available at milwaukee.gov/election."
The Left still fails to grasp why Donald Trump is so popular with young men, even though it’s not that complicated.

Perhaps it is because the Left refuses to look deep at itself and acknowledge widespread failure, on an institutional level, to appeal to men, or at the very least, refrain from attacking them as toxic, privileged, and evil. A recent New York Times opinion article perfectly displays their willful ignorance and failure to scrutinize themselves.

Writing in The Times on Monday, John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, chalks up Trump’s popularity among men to some special sauce, some mystical Alpha voodoo, some “bro whispering” that the former president deploys to ensnare and enchant dudes. (Click HERE to sign up for Mr. Right’s weekly newsletter)

“His playbook? A master class in bro whispering: championing crypto, securing the endorsement of Dave Portnoy — the unapologetically offensive founder of Barstool Sports — and giving the U.F.C. president, Dana White, who embodies the alpha-male archetype that appeals to many young men, a prime spot at the Republican National Convention,” Della Volpe wrote.

“Mr. Trump has also cultivated relationships with simpatico comedians, pranksters, influencers and Silicon Valley billionaires like Elon Musk — all while his team bombards podcasts and social media with misinformation and memes to rally his troops.”

Della Volpe then suggests that Kamala Harris should look to “President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 to President John F. Kennedy’s Peace Corps in 1961 to President Bill Clinton’s AmeriCorps in 1993” in order to boost civil engagement and renew the strength of American men while calming their economic fears.

“Donald Trump has gained ground with Gen Z by systematically exploiting the fears and insecurities of young men, making them feel that their masculinity and future are under siege. Kamala Harris can counter that narrative by listening and recognizing their fears but also by offering something more profound: a vision of hope, strength and shared purpose,” he wrote.

Buddy, Trump is not making them feel that their masculinity is under siege. It is under siege. It is under siege from Harris herself, from institutions like The New York Times and Harvard.

For at least a decade now, the Left has vilified men. Colleges are factories where women are manufactured into raging feminists and then shipped out to corporate HR departments where they will belittle male employees for making mildly suggestive jokes. Politicians like Harris and Walz demean men in their half-hearted, eleventh-hour attempts to win them over. Liberal media is a viper den of feminism. Outlets routinely publish trashy think pieces about why toxic masculinity is a threat to women, and why, if you don’t vote for Kamala Harris, you are misogynistic, medieval ogre. Hollywood is no different, producing movies with the same kind of feminist moral preening that has soaked through America’s newspapers. (RELATED: Kamala’s New Pro-Man Ad Immediately Demeans Men, And Offers A Twisted View Of Fatherhood)

And of course, when someone like Trump sees the vacuum, fills it, and does something positive for men, the Left and The New York Times opinion section have to frame it as some nefarious plot, a highly calculated “playbook.” No, Trump is celebrating things men love, like UFC, football, day trading, Elon Musk. He’s just being one of the boys. It’s not magical alchemy. People like Della Volpe will blame everyone and everything but themselves, and until they turn their attention to their own side, they will continue to miss the painfully obvious.

“As most of you know, the city of Detroit and the home state of Michigan mean a lot to me,” he said. “And going into this election, the spotlight is on us more than ever, and I think it’s important to use your voice. So I’m encouraging everybody to get out and vote please.”

Eminem then said people should not be afraid to express their opinions, adding he does not want an America where people experience retribution for doing so.

“I also think people shouldn’t be afraid to express their opinions, and I don’t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known,” he said. “I think Vice President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.”

Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said in 2022 that there is “no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech,” though it remains unclear if Walz was speaking about censorship on social media or actual government regulations on individuals spreading misinformation.

Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also said in a television interview recently that Americans should be “criminally charged” for spreading Russian propaganda.

“I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda, and whether they should be civilly or even in some cases, criminally charged, is something that would be a better deterrence,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow in an interview.

“I think we need to uncover all of the connections and make it very clear that you could vote however you want, but we are not going to let adversaries, whether it is Russia, China, Iran, or anybody else, basically try to influence Americans as to how we should vote in picking our leaders,” she added.

While Eminem avoided any attacks on former President Donald Trump during his endorsements, he has been a vocal opponent of the former president in his past statements. In 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated president, Eminem famously called the former president a “bitch” and rapped about raping pro-Trump commentator Ann Coulter in a song featured on fellow Detroit rapper Big Sean’s studio album “I Decided.”

“I’m anti, can’t no government handle a commando. Your man don’t want it, Trump’s A BITCH. I’ll make his whole brand go under,” Eminem said of Trump on the song “No Favors.”

“And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster. With a lamp post, door handle, shutter. A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber. Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter. A banjo and manhole cover,” he also rapped.
Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her closing presidential campaign argument in an address next week in the nation's capital, her campaign announced on Wednesday.

According to a senior campaign official, Harris will deliver what's being described as a major "closing argument" address next Tuesday - one week until Election Day - on the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.

The campaign spotlighted that then-President Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021. Many of those who attended Trump's rally then marched to the U.S. Capital and joined other protesters in storming the building in an attempt to upend congressional certification of President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.

CASH DASH: THIS CANDIDATE IS THE CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER

The campaign official said in her speech, Harris will make the case that it's time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new path forward. The official added that the vice president's speech will aim to contrast what a Harris term in the White House would look like compared to another four years of a Trump presidency.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW

The campaign sees the Ellipse as a symbolic location that they believe will help make clear to voters the choice in the presidential election. Trump and Harris are locked in a margin-of-error battle in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House.

Trump, who has been indicted multiple times and made history as the first current or former president convicted in a criminal case, has regularly said during the 2024 campaign that if he returned to the White House, he would prosecute his political foes.

And both Biden and Harris - who replaced her boss atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July after Biden ended his re-election bid - have repeatedly warned voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy if he's re-elected.

"Our democracy is at stake," the president said on Tuesday. "Think about it. Think about what would happen if Donald Trump wins this election."

Word of the Harris address in the nation's capital was first reported earlier on Wednesday by NBC News.
Wealthy business magnate Elon Musk and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are trading jabs as Election Day 2024 draws near, with Walz accusing Musk of "skippin' like a dips---" and Musk most recently comparing Walz to the clown face emoji.

On the campaign trail in Wisconsin on Tuesday, Walz facetiously referred to Musk as former President Donald Trump's "running mate."

The billionaire business tycoon has endorsed Trump and is campaigning for him.

"Elon's on that stage, jumpin' around, skippin' like a dips--- … " Walz said.

TIM WALZ SLAMS ELON MUSK AS A ‘DIPS---’ DURING RALLY WITH OBAMA IN WISCONSIN

Musk poured millions of dollars into the America PAC, which is awarding $1 million each day to one person who has signed a petition expressing support for the First and Second Amendments.

"Every day, from now through Nov 5, @America PAC will be giving away $1M to someone in swing states who signed our petition to support free speech & the right to bear arms! We want to make sure that everyone in swing states hears about this and I suspect this will ensure they do," Musk recently tweeted.

Trump has said that as president he would establish a "government efficiency commission," and that Musk has agreed to helm the task force.

ELON MUSK GIVES $75M TO PRO-TRUMP SUPER PAC, HITS ROAD IN PENNSYLVANIA

"That guy is literally the richest man in the world, spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election," Walz said. "Donald Trump has already promised that he would put Elon in charge of government regulations that oversee the businesses that Elon runs."

Musk is mocking Walz in posts on X.

"You’re gonna lose, @Tim_Walz," Musk tweeted along with the clown emoji when responding to a clip of Walz's remarks. "Saving the American people from the torture of hearing you speak for 4 years was worth it," he added, concluding the post with the tears of joy emoji.

Donald Trump will appear on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast Friday.

It’s a smart move, sure to reach millions of Rogan listeners; he runs the biggest podcast on Spotify, after all. And no one can say it’s preaching to choir: Rogan himself hasn’t endorsed a candidate, and while a plurality of “avid fans” are Republicans, he brings in a fairly even split of Democrats and Independents as well. Trump has a chance to reach millions of moderate, potentially undecided voters, answering questions from Rogan’s signature, unfiltered stream of consciousness.

Yet for all the power Rogan has to cut through corporate media gatekeepers, his audience is still made up of mostly young men — a demo that Trump seemingly has on lock. What Trump really needs to do to build an unbeatable coalition is bring more young women into the fold.

Trump can go on any conservative female podcaster’s show, but that’s too easy. Sitting down with Riley Gaines isn’t likely to reach many undecided women; he must meet them where they’re at. Too bad there isn’t a female version of Rogan …

The closest thing in terms of viewership is “Call Her Daddy,” Alex Cooper’s sex and lifestyle podcast that ranks number three on Spotify. Kamala Harris went on last month to give a 45-minute stump speech on abortion, so it’s likely not the best format or audience for Trump.

The next best thing is “Red Scare,” the influential indie podcast hosted by “bohemian layabouts” Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. There’s nothing else quite like it online. It’s a female-oriented show that covers culture and politics, with frequent “Loveline” episodes dedicated to answering audience questions about sex and dating. The show’s vibe feels lefty — and the audience, based on who calls in, seems to be mostly artsy young women and gays — but the hosts engage with all the right-wing thought of the day. Still, they remain intellectually independent and genuinely edgy, a rare currency in today’s cultural criticism.

Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson went on the show recently, and Khachiyan has publicly invited Trump on as well. It’s an offer he should undoubtedly take her up on.

Ok but I already shook your hand can you come on the pod now? pic.twitter.com/4R3mSZ28fR — Anna Khachiyan (@annakhachiyan) October 21, 2024

If not “Red Scare,” then there are other options — not that Trump need limit it to one.

Former Real Housewife and businesswoman Bethenny Frankel hosts a show of her own, “Just B.” Frankel doesn’t seem too political herself, but she has respectably noted that she’d “rather be canceled than muzzled.” Even if she’s not voting for Trump, they’re fellow New York City elites who built a business empire from scratch; game recognizes game. They’ll surely have plenty of interesting things to talk about.

Quick. Someone tell Whitney that she’s not allowed to make jokes about Democratic candidates! pic.twitter.com/RbK02E3hL2 — Dr. Jebra Faushay (@JebraFaushay) October 20, 2024

Whitney Cummings show, the “Good for You” podcast, is another good option. Cummings is a mainstream female comic who, even in the cringe-tastic era of woke comedy, has managed to stay funny with a new stand-up special currently on tour. Politically, she’s equal opportunity insult comic who doesn’t seem to have any particular animosity towards Trump, yet she took flack online this week for roasting Tim Walz’s connections to China. It also doesn’t hurt that the two go way back; Cummings served on the panel of Trump’s Comedy Central Roast in 2011.

And if Trump didn’t get enough earned media with the McDonald’s stunt, then he can always go on the Hawk Tuah Girl’s podcast, “Talk Tuah” with Hailey Welch. Really, the viral memes just write themselves.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer didn't hold back at a Tuesday rally for Kamala Harris as she rebuked former President Trump's comments from earlier this month, in which he claimed that if the vice president assumes office, "the whole country will be like… Detroit."

Trump's comments are even more poignant considetring Detroit's reputation as one of the most dangerous cities for violent crime in the nation.

"I know you all saw what he said about this beautiful city. He called Detroit a failure and a mess, proving he ain't firing on all cylinders," Whitmer said before Eminem and former President Barack Obama took the stage to court votes for Harris. "He doesn't have a clue what the hell he was talking about. And you know what I think? He ought to keep Detroit out of his mouth."

INTERVIEWING DONALD TRUMP: A LAST-MINUTE BLITZ AND NEW CLOSING MESSAGE

Last month, during his speech at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump said: "The whole country will be like – you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit."

"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president," he said. "A mess."

In 2018, Detroit had the highest violent crime rate of 2,007.8 incidents per 100,000 people, according to the data from the FBI’s 2018 Uniform Crime Report, making it the only midsize or large city in the U.S. with such a high number.

That year, the city reported 261 homicides and around 13,500 violent crimes, even though its population is less than 700,000. Meanwhile, local officials claim violent crime is down 8% in 2024, and shootings and carjackings have also decreased.

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP WIN WOULD BE 'CATASTROPHIC' FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT FIRST TERM TELLS DIFFERENT TALE

Detroit still faces big problems, like a high unemployment rate and many residents living below the poverty line.

In 2023, the number of homicides fell to 252, the lowest since 1966, but the city has had a changing population. Detroit had nearly 1.7 million residents in the 1960s, but that number dropped to about 620,376 in 2022.

But the data can be hard to verify since the Federal Bureau of Investigation quietly updated its 2022 crime data to show an increase in violent crimes, despite previous data showing violent crimes had fallen that year, which was touted as a victory for the Biden-Harris administration.

Detroit police are currently investigating a double shooting that killed an 18-year-old early Monday afternoon. And just a day after the rally, two men are in critical condition after being shot Wednesday morning near Detroit's New Center district.

Both candidates are vying to win the battleground state's vote with the election just two weeks away. On Friday, Trump also made a Detroit rally stop, promising to put "Detroit first," "Michigan first," and "America first."

Trump told supporters, "Your beautiful place, your beautiful city" was "decimated as if by a foreign army."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Team Trump Michigan communications director Victoria LaCivita said: "Like many Americans, President Trump remembers when Detroit was lauded as the gold standard for auto manufacturing success and revolutionized the industry. Detroit has suffered from globalist policies championed by Kamala Harris that have shipped manufacturing overseas. Detroit's population has dropped over 60 percent since 1960, maintains the third highest homicide rate in the nation, and a poverty rate for full-time workers three times as high as the rest of Michigan. As President Trump emphasized in his speech, his policies will usher in a new era of economic success and stability for Detroit, helping the city reach its fullest potential."
Vice President Kamala Harris gave an unexpected address from her residence Wednesday to respond to former White House chief of staff John Kelly’s claims about how Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would govern if reelected.

The New York Times and The Atlantic both published stories Tuesday detailing interviews with Kelly, who claimed that the former president said Hitler “did some good things,” wanted generals like the Nazi dictator had and would rule like a fascist. The Trump campaign denied the content of both stories.

Spokesperson Steven Chueng said the comments were “debunked stories,” adding that the former chief of staff “beclowned” himself. Harris waded into the dispute Wednesday, saying that Kelly’s statements made it clear the former president was “unhinged and unstable.”

“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.

“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued. (RELATED: CNN Guest Calls Out Selectively Edited Clip Of Trump Straight To Hosts Faces)

The Atlantic’s story containing Kelly’s comments also alleged that the former president disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. In addition to the Trump campaign, former officials, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story.

“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” the family’s lawyer, Natalie Khawam, tweeted.

Vice President Harris is a fraud. I was in the White House at a senior level much longer than General Kelly. He is complicit in this fraud and has lied to the American people. His lies, as well as John Bolton’s, are a disservice to Nation at this critical time. So are the VP’s. https://t.co/2b77pMsVVl — Keith Kellogg (@generalkellogg) October 23, 2024

Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor-In-Chief of the Atlantic who wrote the Tuesday article, similarly published a story in September 2020 claiming that Trump canceled a 2018 visit to a French cemetery where American troops were buried and had called them “suckers” and “losers.” The credibility of the story, which is based on anonymous sources, has also come under fire. Former national security adviser John Bolton has denied Trump ever said the words, instead stating Trump didn’t make the trip for weather and security reasons.

Harris’ schedule was adjusted just an hour before her unexpected press conference to include that she would be giving remarks at her residence. The vice president spoke for just about three minutes and did not take any questions. Similar to Harris’ message Wednesday, Biden’s campaign message circled around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president dropped out of the presidential race, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the slogan, Axios reported.

Less than two weeks until the election, the vice president is trailing Trump in all seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages.

“Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guard rails against his propensities and his actions,” Harris said.
Several election forecast models have shifted in favor of former President Donald Trump winning the upcoming presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris.

FiveThirtyEight, polling expert Nate Silver, J.L. Partners, Decision Desk HQ, and the Hill released election forecast results from their models, which found that Trump’s chances of winning the upcoming election were greater than Harris’s.

In a Decision Desk HQ/the Hill election forecast, the model found that Trump had a 52 percent chance of winning the election, while Harris held a 42 percent chance of winning the election.

The Hill reported that “since late August,” Harris had between a 54 percent and 56 percent chance of winning the election, adding that “in early October,” things began to shift as Trump and Harris were predicted to have “chances” that were “closer to 50 percent”:

Since late August, the election forecast put Harris’s chances of winning between approximately 54 percent and 56 percent. In early October, however, those dynamics began to shift, and the election forecast predicted both candidates’ chances to be closer to 50 percent.

Trump ended up taking the lead as of October 20, days after Trump and Harris were predicted to have had equal chances at winning the presidential election.

An election forecast from J.L. Partners found that there was a 65.9 percent chance of Trump winning the upcoming presidential election, while Harris had a 34 percent chance of winning.

The election forecast from J.L. Partners also found that in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump had a 67.7 percent chance of winning, while in the swing state of North Carolina, Trump had a 76.9 percent chance of winning.

In the swing state of Georgia, Trump was found to have a 75 percent chance of winning, while Trump’s chances in Arizona were listed as being 62.3 percent.

In a Substack post, Silver, who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote that current data “continues to be pretty negative” for Harris, adding that “three recent high-quality national polls” have Trump leading currently, according to Fox News.

Silver’s election model found that Harris was leading nationally with 48.8 percent, while Trump received 47.2 percent.

In a post on X, Silver wrote that Trump’s leads in several “national polls” were “not a great sign” for Kamala Harris in the election.

FiveThirtyEight found that Trump “wins 52 times out of 100,” while Harris “wins 48 times out of 100.”

RealClearPolitics’ betting odds average for the presidential election found that Trump received a 59.0, while Harris received a 39.8.
CNN’s Jake Tapper admitted Monday that former President Donald Trump could potentially win the 2024 presidential race if it were held tomorrow, based on data from prominent pollster Nate Silver.

Democrats are growing increasingly concerned as November approaches, with polls and pundits warning that Vice President Kamala Harris is falling behind with key voting blocs, such as black men and Hispanics. On “The Lead With Jake Tapper,” the CNN host shared statistics from Silver’s most recent election prediction, highlighting Trump’s lead in key swing states like Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Trump Will Likely ‘Close The Gap’ On Election Day, Even If Harris Leads In Early Voting)

“Let’s also take a look at where the state of the race is right now and I could do this with the real clear politics average or CNN‘s average or whatever. But just looking today, I went to Nate Silver‘s ‘Silver Bullet Substack’ and he has Trump slightly up in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, Harris likely up in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and they‘re tied in Pennsylvania,”

WATCH:

“If that were to be the result tomorrow that‘s basically a Trump win, I mean, ultimately,” Tapper continued. “Because she needs the three blue wall states plus Nevada and she doesn‘t have them right now. Are you worried about where the state of the race is, right this second? Just be honest.”

Former Biden presidential campaign aide Ashley Allison went on to state how worried she is about the outcome of the race, with America First Policy Institute chief communications officer stating he was “more confident” in Trump winning.

In a Substack piece on Sunday, Silver stated that the latest data on Harris is “pretty negative,” noting that three national polls now show Trump in the lead.

“The data continues to be pretty negative for Kamala Harris,” Silver wrote. “There are now three recent high-quality national polls that show Donald Trump leading — a difficult circumstance for Harris, given Democrats’ Electoral College disadvantage— and her edge in our national polling average is down to 1.7 points. National polls don’t influence the model that much, and the race remains basically a toss-up, but it’s not hard to think of reasons that Trump could win.”

Silver’s current Electoral College prediction gives Trump a 53% chance of winning, while Harris holds a slight lead in the popular vote by 1.6%. Additionally, polling averages from RealClearPolitics recently showed the former president leading by 0.8 points, with 48.3% support across seven key battleground states compared to Harris’s 47.5%.

The owner of the Los Angeles Times instructed the paper not to make a presidential endorsement for the first time in two decades, just weeks ahead of the 2024 election, according to Semafor Tuesday.

The Los Angeles Times editorial board published a list of their electoral endorsements on Oct. 14, where it referred to the 2024 election as “the most consequential election in a generation” but made no mention of endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. The board reportedly planned to follow tradition by endorsing the Democratic nominee for president until Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper’s owner, told them earlier this month not to make a presidential endorsement, two people familiar with the matter told Semafor.

⁦@latimes⁩ won’t endorse anyone for president,1st time in 20 years. LA Times is in Harris’s home state.

The editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates in every presidential election since it first publicly backed former President Barack Obama in the 2008 race, according to Semafor. (RELATED: MSNBC Interviews Early Voters In Key Battleground State, Struggles To Find Anyone Who Voted For Harris)

A Los Angeles Times spokesperson declined to comment on “internal discussions or decisions about editorials or endorsements” in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Soon-Shiong, who bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018, stated they would not be making any endorsements in the 2020 Democratic primary after the board had made the decision to endorse Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to Semafor. The paper endorsed President Joe Biden in the general election that year.

The paper had a history of endorsing Republican presidential candidates until they received backlash for backing former President Richard Nixon in the 1970’s, according to Semafor. From the mid-1970s until 2008, the paper declined to make presidential endorsements of candidates.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said in September that they would not endorse a presidential candidate after internal polling data found 56% of the union’s rank-and-file members supported Republican nominee Donald Trump. The union has historically supported Democrats and donated to left-of-center causes.

National polling has found the presidential race to be at a deadlock tie and has been considered “too close to call,” though it appears that Trump may “close the gap,” CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Monday. The former president led Harris in all of the major battleground states as of Friday, RealClear polling averages found.

New Mexico could very well be the dark horse this election cycle as trends seem to be favorable for former President Donald Trump.

New Mexico has not largely been on the radar for Republicans as much as the main battleground states, but it actually could be in play for a number of reasons.

The release of the latest KA Consulting poll showed Trump trailing Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris by just three percentage points, garnering 46 percent to Harris’s 49 percent support. It should be noted that the three-point difference is within the survey’s +/- 4 percent margin of error, indicating a virtual tie.

Additionally, that survey showed inflation and the economy as the top issue — chosen by 47 percent — followed by 43 percent who said immigration and border security are top issues. Both of these issues are central to Trump’s campaign, and they happen to be his strong suits. It also coincides with the reality that New Mexico is a border state with a hefty Hispanic population, and Trump is performing historically well among Hispanic voters, as recent surveys show. A recent survey out of Florida, for instance, showed Trump leading Harris by double digits among Hispanic voters — 55 percent to Harris’s 41 percent .

Even a recent NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll found Trump continuing to close the gap among this group of voters, with Harris seeing 54 percent support to Trump’s 40 percent. NBC News put it this way:

Overall, the poll shows that Democratic presidential candidate Harris has lost some ground with Latinos at a time when these consequential voters are more likely than the general electorate to cite the economy and the rising cost of living as top priorities.

This is significant as these surveys showed Trump getting just 19 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, bumping up to 27 percent in 2020.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to drop out of the race and back Trump should also help the former president in the state as he was polling eight percent support in New Mexico. Also, the nonprofit group Election Freedom Inc. is running what has been described as an “aggressive 7-figure ad campaign focused on significant policy failures” of Harris.

Coinciding with all of that is also a recent Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll showing Harris up by just four in New Mexico:

Last week, the Albuquerque Journal reported a “strong turnout” in terms of early voting in the state. At the time, it reported, “Going into Tuesday, nearly 4.6% of registered Republicans had already voted in this year’s general election compared to about 4.2% of registered Democrats.”

New Mexico has not swung red in 20 years — since 2004. According to official results, Trump lost the state by 8.3 percent in 2016 and 10.8 percent in 2020. But things could very well change this year.

Early on, Trump previewed his plans to make a play for states like New Mexico, knowing they could very well be in reach.

“One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years, Minnesota,” Trump told Breitbart News.
“I was asked to speak in Concord, North Carolina, tonight and lead in prayer at an event with President Donald J. Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, and other faith leaders. I told the crowd that rallies and positive polls won’t win this election—only God can do that,” Graham wrote in his Facebook post.

“God is the only hope for Donald Trump and He is the only hope for our nation. Would you take a moment tonight and do what we did inside the convention center—PRAY! Join me in praying for President Trump, for this nation, and for this election?” he continued.

Graham then quoted a Bible verse, stating, “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God” (Psalm 20:7).

Images from the event showed a room packed with attendees:

Recent data showed early voting numbers in North Carolina were strong for Republicans, Breitbart News reported on Friday, noting there has also been record-breaking early voting turnout in Georgia.
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Tuesday broke down how the 2024 election is the most “historically close” presidential race in over 50 years.

The numbers from the final polls have calculated that an electoral victory for the current leader would likely amount to 276 electoral votes, which is just 6 votes higher than the 270 needed to become president-elect, Enten said. The past close races added up to 281 electoral votes in 2000 and 296 in 2004, making the 2024 election the “closest polls” ever seen since at least 1972.

“I took a look at the final polls, and then I basically calculated out what the electoral map would look like and how high up would the leading candidate’s electoral total get,” Enten said. “And what we essentially see is right now the leader’s electoral total is 276 electoral votes based upon the polls. If you go back since ’72 and try to find the closest years, if you go back to 2000, which of course was a historically close election, at the end of the campaign, the poll leader’s electoral vote total was just 281 electoral votes. That’s where [former Democratic nominee Al] Gore was in the final polls of that campaign.”

“If you go back to 2004, [former President] George W. Bush was at 296 electoral votes, so based upon the polls at this point, we are heading into the election with the closest polls in the Electoral College that we have ever seen at least in the last 50 years,” Enten continued.

Vice President Kamala Harris needs to win at least three out of the four battleground states in order to win, which includes North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Enten said. Republican nominee Donald Trump leads in North Carolina by less than 1 point while Harris leads in the Great Lakes states by less than 1 point, meaning either candidate could easily win by narrow margins. (RELATED: ‘Good News For Donald Trump’: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Trump Is Performing ‘Significantly Better’ In Swing States)

“Basically, the four states that are likely to determine this outcome are all within 1 point,” Enten said. “And when we span this out to the Electoral College, what do we get? We get exactly this, Harris with that 276 electoral votes because she carries these Great Lake battleground states, right? But, let’s just say we flip Pennsylvania and the polls’ results aren’t exactly right. What do we get? Flip Pennsylvania to red, and then we got Trump to 281 electoral votes which is not very much of a long shot given at this particular point, the race in Pennsylvania is within a single point.”

The final polls ahead of a presidential election have never had such close results in the battleground states since 1972, Enten added.

Trump is narrowly leading Harris in Pennsylvania by 0.3 points, while Harris leads in Wisconsin by 0.5 point and in Michigan by 0.3 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polls. The former president holds a 0.8 point lead in North Carolina and a 1.5 point lead in Georgia.

Harris’ averages in the Great Lake battleground states are significantly lower than President Joe Biden’s 8-point leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2020, Enten said during an Oct. 14 segment. Trump also led in every single swing state with a 0.8 point overall lead as of Friday, according to RealClear polling averages.

Former President Donald Trump is closing out the final Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll before the election leading Vice President Kamala Harris.

The survey — the final AJC survey before the election — has Trump on top, leading Harris with 47 percent of the vote. Harris comes four points behind, garnering 43 percent support. Technically, that four-point difference is outside of the survey’s +/- 3.1 percent margin of error.

However, eight percent of voters in the Peach State, according to this survey, have indicated that they are undecided. If that’s true, that is more than enough to swing the race in either direction.

Georgia has smashed records in terms of its early voting numbers. In the first two days alone, half a million people cast their ballot.

“The prior record for day one voting was 136,000 — blew that away, over 300,000,” former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily, discussing the first day of early voting last week. “After yesterday, it was 550,000 people [who] have voted.”

That figure is now well over 1.4 million, as Georgia Public Broadcasting detailed on Monday:

A record 1.4 million ballots have been cast in Georgia since early voting began last Tuesday. That exceeds the early vote totals in the last presidential election year. What that means for which candidates will prevail in November is still an open question, but those numbers do tell us something about the nature of this race and the strategies the presidential campaigns might take to pull off a win. Zachary Peskowitz, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, spoke with GPB’s Peter Biello.

“I think it’ll be interesting to see how the demographics change,” Peskowitz said, discussing early voting in the Peach State.

“So early on, we’ve seen a very high share of the early voters are over the age of 65. So is that going to persist? How does the data change once we’ve had a second weekend? And I think that will be very important to look at to get — to get a sense of where we’re going to be on Election Day,” he added.

Tuesday’s RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Trump up by an average of 2.5 percent in the Peach State.
Journalist Mark Halperin said Tuesday that former President Donald Trump will secure victory on Nov. 5 if early voting trends hold.

While Democrats maintain a significant lead in early voter turnout, Republicans have cut the gap compared to 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Halperin, on his 2WAY platform, said all the analysts he has spoken to since Monday believe Trump will win if this trend continues, as Democrats will be unable to combat Republicans’ early vote gains on Election Day. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Used To Think Border Wall Was ‘Un-American.’ Now She Supports It.)

WATCH:

“If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that’s a big if, we’ll almost certainly know before Election Day who’s going to win the election … Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day … It’s extraordinarily important, and we got to track that day to day,” Halperin said. “That’s more important than the polls right now. It’s more important than almost anything because it’s giving us insight into a variety of factors that are accounting for a Republican overperformance by various metrics in the early voting in the battleground states.”

The journalist later quoted a blog post by The Nevada Independent CEO and editor Jon Ralston published Monday evening.

WATCH:

“The Clark firewall, that’s Clark County where Las Vegas is, where the vast majority of the state’s population is, has all but collapsed. The Democrats usually have a huge lead there, 4,500 votes. The rurals are overperforming their share of the electorate,” Halperin said. “And [Ralston] says … ‘It’s too soon to call it a trend, but this was a huge day for Republicans in Nevada (they are ahead in Washoe now, too, erasing a deficit). A few more days like this, though, and the Democratic bedwetting will reach epic proportions.'”

“As we said yesterday, don’t overread the early vote, okay? It can change. We don’t know exactly who’s casting these ballots, how they’re voting, etc.,” Halperin added. “But every analyst I’ve talked to in the last 24 hours, including people who speak publicly, say if this continues, Donald Trump can’t lose because the Democrats can’t possibly do well enough on Election Day.”

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten asserted Monday that Trump will probably gain ground against Vice President Kamala Harris on Election Day, despite her potential early voting lead.

“We’re expecting that Election Day vote to be very good for Donald Trump. And the average polling, we see him up by 17 [points],” Enten said.

“Even if Harris leads in that early count because of this mail vote, Donald Trump is very likely going to close the gap pretty quickly on Election Day,” he added.

Trump currently holds leads over Harris in all of the top battleground states, according to RealClearPolling averages.

I’ve seen some amazing crowds in my life. In 1985, my mom scored me and a couple of friends tickets (and backstage passes) to see Prince in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the Purple Rain tour. I still remember standing in the crowd with my lace fingerless gloves on, thinking my mom was the absolute coolest for getting us into the arena. As Prince took the stage and spoke the intro to “Let’s Go Crazy” (“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life …”), thousands of people just like me went nuts. The rafters shook from the weight of all the jumping and shuffling feet.

Almost 40 years later, I stood in the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, waiting for President Trump to take the stage. Less than 48 hours earlier, he’d been shot in the ear by a crazed would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania, the sad result of many months of dangerous rhetoric by Democrats and their allies in the corporate media. But he’d survived, pumping his fist to the crowd at the Secret Service dragged him offstage, yelling “Fight! Fight! Fight!” to his supporters. Finally, he took the stage. Compared to the sound I heard that evening, the roar of all those teenage Prince fans was nothing.

As we head into the final weeks of the presidential campaign, the corporate press continues to tell us that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are running a campaign of “joy.” They tell us that the Democrats are the ones painting a positive vision for our future while Donald Trump and J.D. Vance do nothing but sow division and push hate. In August, a headline in the Associated Press read, “Harris is pushing joy. Trump paints a darker picture. Will mismatched moods matter?” In September, TIME Magazine said, “Don’t Underestimate Kamala Harris’ Good Vibes Only Campaign.” The same article suggests that all Donald Trump had to offer was “continuous warfare.”

Well, I don’t know which Donald Trump those people have been watching, because I’ve covered dozens of Trump campaign rallies, and I’ve seen more joy than you could believe. I saw it in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention, where the crowd screamed and laughed as they watched Kid Rock perform his hits and Hulk Hogan rip off his T-shirt to reveal Trump merch underneath. Since then, I’ve seen it at countless Trump rallies, which (despite what the corporate press will tell you) are filled with kind, fun-loving people who just so happen to be fed up with the Biden-Harris administration.

In recent weeks, President Trump has cracked up crowds with off-the-cuff quips about his attempted assassination. He’s been on the top comedy podcasts in the country, where he’s gotten belly laughs out of professional comedians. Every time he gets onstage, he cracks at least ten jokes that make his crowds roar with laughter. Just because the corporate press only airs the footage in which he points out the serious problems we’re dealing with in this country — an unending stream of criminal migrants at the southern border, for instance, or the increasing possibility that we’re headed for World War III — doesn’t mean Donald Trump can’t do joy.

In fact, he does joy better than any politician I’ve ever covered.

I’d like to see Kamala Harris do five minutes on how toilets don’t flush as well as they used to and make people laugh while doing it. If Tim Walz signs one of those stupid camo hats he’s always wearing and tosses them into the crowd, would anyone even bother to catch them?

Meanwhile, Donald Trump is throwing hats and cracking jokes, all while the media tries to portray him as some doom-and-gloom would-be dictator who wants to throw all his enemies in prison. So far, there are only two presidents I can think of who’ve tried to throw their enemies in prison, and those presidents are Barack Obama (who spied on journalists for reporting on his administration) and Joe Biden (who, as we know, has tried to throw President Trump in jail in two separate federal cases, failing miserably both times).

We are at a pivotal moment in this country. This election is the most important I’ve ever covered as a journalist. In fact, it’s the most important one I’ve ever lived through. On one side, we have an administration that wants to poison the minds of our children with ideas about self-mutilation and socialism and the entirely fictional scourge of “systemic white supremacy” that supposedly plagues our institutions. These people want to throw their political enemies in prison, and they expect us to believe the media’s lies that all they care about are fun memes and “joy.”

On the other side, we have people who want to teach our children that this country is the greatest that has ever existed on planet Earth. We have people who will strive to build amazing things and end all the seemingly endless conflicts that have upended the globe over the past four years. These people, led by Donald Trump, don’t want more foreign wars. They don’t want the government or corporations shoving a woke agenda down our throats and making all dissent illegal. They want freedom, prosperity, and equality of opportunity for all. And, at least with Donald Trump in charge, they want to have some fun while doing it.

How’s that for joy?

This article is adapted from Bianca de la Garza’s forthcoming book Incoming: On the Front Lines of the Left’s War on Truth, to be published on Oct. 22, 2024 by Post Hill Press.

Bianca de la Garza is a 10-time Emmy® nominated, award-winning journalist and author of the new book, INCOMING: On the Front Lines of the Left's War on Truth.
Political commentator Victor Davis Hanson explained Monday on Fox News why former President Donald Trump’s Sunday McDonald’s stop resonated with the working class.

During an appearance on “The Ingraham Angle,” Hanson detailed how Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s struck a chord with working-class Americans and pointed out Trump’s genuine nature and consistent message. Hanson also added that Trump’s consistency on key issues—securing the border, promoting fossil fuels and fighting crime—has cemented his appeal among middle-class voters.

“Well, it’s authenticity. It’s his issues, his agenda, they stay consistent. He didn’t change them to the same thing, secure border, predictable, deterrence abroad, fight crime, promote fossil fuels. It’s consistent, and everybody knows it’s consistent,” Hanson told Laura Ingraham. “It’s aimed at a middle class. And then there’s the person Trump.”

Hanson contrasted Trump’s approach with what he sees in other politicians, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.

“He wears the same type of clothes, whether he’s in the inner city or whether he’s out on the campaign trail or he’s up in Trump Tower,” Hanson added. “He has the same Bronx accent. He doesn’t have a Jamaican accent, a black accent, Hispanic accent, depending on the crowd he’s addressing like Kamala Harris. He didn’t switch over and modify his positions in an antithetical way just to get elected.”

WATCH:

Hanson also drew a clear line between Trump’s perceived authenticity and Harris’s political shifts.

“And that’s in contrast with her. The reason we know that he’s authentic and she’s not is because the last 90 days she’s refuted Laura all of her lifetime agendas and has embraced things that are eerily similar to Trump,” Hanson continued.

In contrast, Hanson criticized Harris for lacking authenticity in similar situations and argued that Harris’s background in government and academia starkly differed from Trump’s hands-on experience in building and real estate

“She’s been in government and among the elites her entire life,” Hanson added. “She’s the child of two PhDs and she just went straight into the political world and has never come out of it. He’s a builder, so he has to know what cement workers do, what electricians do, what plumbers do, and he likes the people because they build his things.” (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Trump Will Likely ‘Close The Gap’ On Election Day, Even If Harris Leads In Early Voting)

Trump stepped behind the counter Sunday at a McDonald’s in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, serving fries and taking drive-thru orders. Later that day, Trump attended a Pittsburgh Steelers game against the New York Jets, blending fast food with football as he connected with fans.

British host Piers Morgan and political podcaster Dave Rubin called out Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross on Monday after she claimed that former President Donald Trump was suffering from dementia.

For nearly three years, Republicans have questioned President Joe Biden’s mental fitness, with lawmakers expressing increased concern in June following Biden’s disastrous debate against Trump. On “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” Cross asked why Democrats “can’t go after” Trump regarding his mental fitness, asserting that the former president can no longer “complete sentences,” stand still, or “make sense.”

Before allowing Rubin to push back on Cross’s remarks, Morgan interjected, criticizing the party for “hiding” Biden’s condition “for two years from the American people.”

“What I would say about that is, it’s pretty bloody rich of the Democrats, frankly. After hiding the state of Joe Biden for two years from the American people, when he clearly has got onset early dementia. It’s pretty rich to play the dementia card at Trump who basically does a two-hour rock show most nights on stage,” Morgan said.

“I’ll go further than that. It’s not two years that they hid this, it’s from before he was president,” Rubin said. “I was doing videos in 2019 about this. Whether he has dementia or Parkinson’s or whatever, it is a fact that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and likely Barack Obama, but undoubtedly Kamala Harris — they got him in an office, I’m talking about Joe Biden, and they basically threatened him with the 25th Amendment which is why he’s not running anymore. We know this is a fact because Joe Biden basically said that on ‘The View’ that he still thinks he’s capable and that he would have beat Donald Trump.”

Rubin continued to call out the “absurdity” of Cross’ claims, noting how Trump has been on the campaign trail conducting interviews, podcasts and rallies. (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Trump Will Likely ‘Close The Gap’ On Election Day, Even If Harris Leads In Early Voting)

WATCH:

“The absurdity, the patent absurdity, that you were gonna say that Donald Trump who basically a day after being shot is back out there,” Rubin continued. “Who is doing more interviews, mainstream podcast[s], everything else — bouncing around, crazy rallies.

“The guy, whether you like him or not — I get you guys don’t like him — but whether you like him or not you know what the guy thinks and he’s more than happy to explain it to you over and over again. The idea that he now is too old after what they just pulled on Biden is so hypocritical,” Ruben added.

Before Biden’s debate against Trump, Democrats consistently defended the president’s mental fitness, often calling him “sharp” and praising his cognitive abilities. However, after the June 27 debate, Democrats began questioning whether Biden could handle another four years in office, as he was seen on national television freezing mid-sentence and struggling to complete his statements.

Though Biden claimed his withdrawal was “in the best interest of my party and the country,” pressure had been mounting from Democratic lawmakers and donors. By mid-July a slew of House and Senate Democrats had called for Biden to step down from the 2024 race, with donors additionally pausing funds.

Vice President Kamala Harris stumbled while attempting to defend her economic plans on NBC News Tuesday after host Hallie Jackson questioned why they aren’t resonating with voters, especially as polls show they still favor former President Donald Trump on the issue.

Voters consistently cite their top concerns heading to the ballot box as the economy, inflation and immigration, with 54% trusting Trump on these issues compared to Harris’ 45%, according to an October Gallup poll. During the interview, Jackson pressed Harris on voter disapproval of the current economy, prompting the vice president to attempt to distinguish her plans from those of her current administration.

Despite Harris listing her policy platform ideas on housing, corporate price gouging and the child tax credit, Jackson pushed back on the vice president’s response, questioning why the platform isn’t resonating with voters.

“Then why do you think that’s not landing with voters?” Jackson asked. “Because in numbers it’s the opposite. Former President Trump leads you on this issue.

“Oh but I think it is,” Harris began. “Well, when I’m out — this is why I’m going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and, and, and in Michigan,” Harris said simultaneously with Jackson. “Excuse me, just got in late this morning, actually.

Harris continued to emphasize that she will need to “earn the vote,” asserting that while she is focused on “working people,” Trump is concentrated on “billionaires and big corporations.” (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)

WATCH:

“But going to three states yesterday and I’m going to continue being on the road. I have to earn the vote and it means sharing with folks my plan, but also offering them what objective analysts have shown to be the contrast between me and Donald Trump,” Harris continued. “My plans are focused on working people, the middle class and what we must do to strengthen hard working people to be able to do what they dream and aspire to be able to do.”

“His plans are about giving tax cuts, massive tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. His, so called, plan for the economy — economists have estimated will exacerbate inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So there’s a huge difference between he and I,” Harris concluded.

Roughly two months before President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race on July 21, an estimated 49% of voters surveyed in May believed the president’s guidance had negatively impacted the economy. While Harris has reportedly attempted to distance herself from Biden after entering the race, the vice president has struggled to separate herself from the current president.

During an Oct. 8 interview with ABC’s “The View,” Harris faced significant pushback from political pundits after stating that “not a thing” came to mind when asked if she would change anything about the past four years of the Biden administration. She was further challenged on the issue during her interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, fumbling her response when asked how her presidency would be moving the U.S. “forward,” despite currently being in office.

The Biden-Harris administration’s “smoke and mirrors” border scheme has concealed the true extent of the immigration crisis amid the 2024 election season, San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond revealed during a Monday interview with Glenn Beck.



Between September 2023 and June 2024, the Border Patrol released more than 155,000 foreign nationals onto the streets of San Diego County, Desmond stated.

'This isn’t about securing the border for the Feds — it’s about optics.'

Most of those individuals were dropped off at the Iris Avenue Transit Center, where they hitched a ride to their next destination deeper within the interior of the U.S. after being released by Border Patrol officials.

The Biden-Harris administration was torched for the street releases and the negative optics of using the train station as its main drop-off point for the San Diego Sector.

According to Desmond, the federal government started busing and flying immigrants to other border sectors to reduce the number of street releases in San Diego County.

“There’s about three buses a day that Border Patrol is taking migrants to Yuma, Arizona, which is right on the California-Arizona line. So about three buses per day, and they have about three or four flights per week, leaving San Diego going to Texas, primarily McAllen, Texas,” Desmond told Beck.

“It’s just smoke and mirrors. What they’re doing is they’re just taking these numbers, they’re no longer putting them on our streets, which was very in the open, and press and everything else had access to that, and they’re hiding them by busing them to Arizona or flying them to Texas,” he declared.

Desmond noted that the southern border numbers may be down over the past few months but only from “record highs.”

Border officials told Desmond that the agency planned to restart the street releases in San Diego County last Friday.

“So I think, unfortunately, we’re going to be back to the mayhem that we had in the previous months,” he told Beck. “That’s what I fear.”

He noted that, under the Biden-Harris administration, the San Diego Sector had become the number one spot for border crossings and fentanyl and “one of the top spots for human trafficking.”

Desmond also explained to Beck that several times per week boats packed with illegal aliens are running up onto the shores. The illegal immigrants then jump off the boats and flee on foot into nearby neighborhoods.

“They just abandon the boats on the beach. Those people aren’t even checked or go through Border Patrol. They’re not fingerprinted,” he stated. “That’s been happening for months.”

Desmond slammed the state’s sanctuary status, which prevents local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials.

“The state of California is a sanctuary state, which means our local law enforcement cannot enforce immigration laws. So even these people that are getting off the boats and walking into our neighborhoods, local law enforcement can’t do a thing about it,” he continued.

“There’s very little locally anybody can do about this,” Desmond added.

In a post on X, he wrote, “Border Patrol officials have informed me that street releases were set to resume again last Friday in San Diego County, adding to the more than 155,000 in the past year. But with the election around the corner, the Federal Government was worried about the optics, so every day, they’re bussing illegal immigrants from San Diego to Yuma, Arizona, to fly them across the country.”

“This isn’t about securing the border for the Feds — it’s about optics,” he concluded.

The Border Patrol did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
There were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden-Harris White House, bringing more clarity on the exact toll of the border crisis under the administration.

There were 101,790 migrant encounters at the southern border in September, the final month of fiscal year 2024, according to data released Tuesday by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). These figures include both migrants who crossed the southern border unlawfully and those who appeared at ports of entry. (RELATED: Hospitals Reporting Spike In Migrants Falling Off Border Wall, Needing Medical Attention)

There were roughly 2.1 million migrant encounters along the southern border in fiscal year 2024, the CBP data reveals. This final number puts the total figure of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico during the Biden-Harris administration at roughly 8.5 million.

There were more than 1.5 million Border Patrol encounters between ports of entry — otherwise known as unlawful border crossings — in fiscal year 2024. The figures were a decrease from the roughly two million and 2.2 million unlawful border crossings seen at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, according to the data.

CBP’s release of the September data is the latest border figure for the Biden-Harris administration, which oversaw an unprecedented border crisis during its time occupying the White House.

“You wouldn’t know it from the way President Biden, his ‘border czar,’ Vice President Harris, and their defenders in the media are talking about these numbers, but this was the second-worst year in terms of inadmissible alien encounters ever — only surpassed by the all-time record Biden and Harris set just last fiscal year,” House Homeland Committee Chairman Mark Green said Tuesday. “In terms of official encounters, this year was a disaster.” (RELATED: Illegal Migrant Released By New York For Attempted Murder Arrested Again On Charges Of Trafficking Minor)

“Every day, Americans are experiencing the consequences of the unchecked flow of inadmissible aliens into their communities,” Green continued. “We simply cannot go on like this as a country. These open-borders policies have devastated our safety, security, and sovereignty.”

The new data does not include the approximately 30,000 migrants flown into the country every month via a hotly debated parole program known as CHNV — which has brought in around half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans into the U.S. since the launch of the program.

President Joe Biden in June issued an executive order that aimed to control the number of daily unlawful border crossings amid a peak in illegal border encounters and polls indicating voter dissatisfaction with his handling of the crisis. The outgoing president doubled down on the order in September by extending the number of days it would take at a certain threshold for it to be deactivated.

Despite these election year efforts, the Border Patrol union formally endorsed former President Donald Trump on Oct. 13, with the president of the National Border Patrol Council saying in a rally that every community in the country would “go to hell” if Vice President Kamala wins the presidential election.

The White House defended the latest border numbers in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“The data published today by U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that since the President announced new executive actions to secure the border on June 4, unlawful border crossings have dropped by more than 55% to the lowest levels in over four years,” a spokesperson stated on Tuesday. “Encounters between ports of entry are lower than they were during the last several months of the previous Administration.”

“For months, the Biden-Harris Administration worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to craft a historic bipartisan border security agreement that would have added thousands of frontline personnel to the border – but Congressional Republicans voted against that agreement twice – proving that they are more interested in cynically playing politics than securing the border,” the statement continued. “The Biden-Harris Administration has taken effective action, and Republican officials continue to do nothing.”

Over 40 sheriffs condemned the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the border crisis in a letter sent Tuesday, and further warned that more migrants would devastate small-town America.

The letter, signed by sheriffs in Pennsylvania, Washington and Illinois among other states, accuses the Biden-Harris administration of letting in 10 to 15 million illegal immigrants over the last four years, saying that the U.S. deserves a president that “prioritizes the safety and security of the American people” by securing the border from illegals and drugs. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has encountered over 7 million migrants at the southern border since president Joe Biden took office in January 2021, according to CBP statistics. (RELATED: Biden Admin To End Parole Program For Hundreds Of Thousands Of Migrants)

“None of the 19,500 American cities, towns or villages, is safe from this crisis, and no community is immune to the impact,” the letter said. “Every town is a border town. The President alone can act to fix this crisis. The president can suspend or restrict the entry of non-citizens if it is deemed in the national interest, proclaim a national emergency along the border, and redirect federal funds to construct a border wall. The Biden-Harris Administration has done none of these. And we are seeing the consequences.”

Sheriff James Custer of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a surge in fentanyl has rocked his county of approximately 130,000 people.

“I’ve seen this trend has been going on over the last three years, the fentanyl crisis, that has come across our southern border … our overdose deaths rose each year,” Custer told the DCNF. “Now we are in a slight decline this year, but we have several deaths pending toxicology results.”

There were 107,543 drug overdoses in 2023 across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in May. Fentanyl was estimated to be involved in 74,702 of the cases that year.

“As your sheriffs, we stand ready to do our part in protecting our communities, but we need the President to act,” the letter reads. “The lives of Americans depend on it.”

Sheriff Bob Songer of Klickitat County, Washington, accused the Biden administration of treason by allowing illegal immigrants to stay and not doing enough to stem the tide of migrants.

“I think the open borders is a violation,” Songer told the DCNF. “Personally, I think both the Biden administration and their administrative staff ought to be charged with treason, they’ve broken this country to where we don’t have a border. Yes, it happens in small town America, just as anywhere else.”

Springfield, Ohio, which has a population of just over 58,000 as of 2022, was one of the first towns to make headlines over its sudden influx of Haitian migrants. Between 12,000 and 20,000 migrants have poured into the town since 2021.

“As sheriffs, our first duty is to protect the citizens we serve,” the letter reads. “But today, we find ourselves confronted by a growing crisis that threatens the very fabric of our country and its sovereignty: open-border policies.”

Charleroi, Pennsylvania, a town of only around 4,000 residents, had at least 2,000 predominantly Haitian migrants move in, according to City Journal Oct. 7. Migrant students in the town overwhelmed the school system, with spending to teach English quadrupling from the 2020-2021 school year to the 2024-2025 year.

Biden declared victory in June when he signed an executive order raising asylum standards and lowering the amount of migrants who can get sanctuary. Democratic Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood called Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas’ enforcement of the southern border “historic” despite the massive increases under his watch.

Songer said so far his county of approximately 22,000 hasn’t experienced any migrant crime. However, he added that if migrant criminals should come to his county, he will not be lenient.

“I’m not going to put up with that crap,” Songer told the DCNF. “I don’t care what our governor says about sanctuary crap. The bottom line is, if they’re illegal in our county and they’re committing the law violation, we’re going to deal with them, and they’re going to hit the jail.”

Over half of American voters support the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, according to a September Ipsos poll. A YouGov poll found that 87% of voters think immigration is an “important” issue in the election.

Custer said that voters in his county have a lot of anxiety on what would happen to their communities if immigration continued unimpeded.

“It would be unsustainable. I just don’t see us having the resources to handle an influx of migrants,” Custer told the DCNF.

The White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Virginia is being sued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) over Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s enforcement of a measure aimed at culling noncitizens from the voter rolls — a law introduced by former Gov. Tim Kaine (D), which the DOJ previously approved.

Youngkin issued Executive Order 35 on August 7, directing election officials to remove the names of people who are “unable to verify that they are citizens” to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

According to the Republican governor, the commonwealth removed 6,303 noncitizens from its voter rolls between January 2022 and July 2024, saying they may have “purposefully or accidentally registered to vote.”

The DOJ filed its lawsuit on October 11 in an Alexandria federal court, alleging that the state, its board of elections, and Elections Commissioner Susan Beals are “violating federal law’s prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.”

“Section 8(c)(2) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), also known as the Quiet Period Provision, requires states to complete systematic programs aimed at removing the names of ineligible voters from voter registration lists no later than 90 days before federal elections,” the department said in a press release. “The Quiet Period Provision applies to certain systematic programs carried out by states that are aimed at striking names from voter registration lists based on a perceived failure to meet initial eligibility requirements — including citizenship — at the time of registration.”

While federal law prevents the systemic removal of voters within 90 days of Election Day, Youngkin’s position is that any removals made within that period are case-by-case, not systematic, and therefore allowed under the law.

The Justice Department is seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of impacted eligible voters to vote on November 5 and would prohibit future quiet period violations, officials said.

“The department also seeks remedial mailings to educate eligible voters concerning the restoration of their rights and adequate training of local officials and poll workers to address confusion and distrust among eligible voters accused of being noncitizens,” the press release noted.

Despite the DOJ’s problems with Youngkin’s executive order, the governor told Fox News that it was only enforcing a 2006 rule put in place by then-Gov. Kaine — now a U.S. senator — and that it was pre-cleared by the DOJ at the time.

“[W]e now know that the Virginia law was reviewed and expressly approved by the DOJ civil rights division,” Youngkin said. “Now, after being applied for 18 years by both Democrat and Republican governors, with just 25 days before the presidential election, the Biden-Harris DOJ sues Virginia: Ensuring Virginia’s voter rolls do not include non-citizens is constitutional, it’s the law in Virginia and it’s common sense.”

A Kaine administration correspondence obtained by the outlet confirmed this to be the case, revealing that a Virginia Attorney General’s official official asked the DOJ, then under former President George W. Bush (R), for approval of the law.

An official in the Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section wrote back two months later in December 2006, saying that the U.S. attorney general “does not interpose any objections to the specific changes,” although they noted that the feds could object in the future.

An “internal Richmond memo” obtained by Fox News “asserted that the established process for removing noncitizens from voter rolls has taken place under Democratic and Republican governors since Kaine,” the outlet reported.

“The Virginia model for Election Security works. This isn’t a Democrat or Republican issue, it’s an American and Virginian issue,” Youngkin said when announcing the Executive Order in August. “Every legal vote deserves to be counted without being watered down by illegal votes or inaccurate machines. In Virginia, we don’t play games and our model for election security is working.”

After the DOJ announced its lawsuit, the governor released a scathing statement pledging the defend the “commonsense” rule:

With less than 30 days until the election, the Biden-Harris Department of Justice is filing an unprecedented lawsuit against me and the Commonwealth of Virginia, for appropriately enforcing a 2006 law signed by Democrat Tim Kaine that requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls — a process that starts with someone declaring themselves a non-citizen and then registering to vote. Virginians — and Americans — will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy. With the support of our Attorney General, we will defend these commonsense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us. Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.

Youngkin further responded to the lawsuit during a Sunday Fox News appearance with Shannon Bream, saying that there is already a safeguard in place for those who should not have been culled from the voter rolls — same-day registration and voting.

A spokesperson for Sen. Kaine said, “just as we want to block non-citizens from voting, we need to keep eligible voters from being purged from voting rolls, particularly just weeks from an election.”

“Senator Kaine is focused on making sure that every eligible Virginian has the opportunity to vote in this critical election,” the spokesperson added in a statement to Fox News.
Republican Florida Rep. Byron Donalds sparred with CNN host Jim Acosta Tuesday over Republican nominee Donald Trump’s “enemy from within” remarks.

Trump suggested that using the National Guard and possibly the military against “the enemy from within” if they are to cause chaos on Election Day during an Oct. 14 interview on Fox News. Acosta pressed Donalds on whether it is acceptable for Trump to accuse some prominent Democrats, namely California Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, are enemies from within.

“I know that Adam Schiff when he was chairman of the Intelligence Committee was leaking information to the press that was classified information, supposed to be held in the skiff. This is why then-Speaker [Kevin] McCarthy kicked Schiff off of the Intelligence Committee because he abused his purposes for political reasons. That is dangerous. It’s a very dangerous thing,” Donalds said. “Number two, Donald Trump was answering a question from [Fox News host] Maria Bartiromo, and what Maria Bartiromo was asking about was unrest in the streets … If you just go back to the summer of 2020, the Summer of Love like the left likes to talk about, you had riots in every major city in the country. That is very dangerous and that is very concerning.”

“So congressman, you’d be okay with Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi being deemed the enemy from within? Would you go along with them being rounded up, would you go along with them being arrested?” Acosta asked, with Donalds replying “absolutely not.”

WATCH:

Donalds argued that Trump did not call on Schiff or Pelosi to be arrested, but expressed concern about their response if the former president is reelected. The Florida representative said Schiff, the former House Intelligence Committee chairman, laundered “phony intelligence” into the political system in 2016, 2017 and 2018 related to the now-debunked allegations that Trump colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election.

Acosta then asked the Florida congressman if Trump’s remark should be “denounced,” leading Donalds to say that Trump never “weaponized” the Department of Justice or the U.S. military to go after his political opponents. Acosta claimed Donalds’ answer was not “in line with reality” as he has heard Trump and his supporters chant for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to be locked up during the 2016 campaign.

“Okay congressman, so I’m asking you if Donald Trump orders people inside this country, citizens like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi to be arrested, you’re saying, I think I just heard you say a few moments ago that you would not go along with that. So, why not denounce what the former president is saying when he calls them the enemy from within? Shouldn’t that be denounced?” Acosta asked.

“Jim, are you gonna let me answer your question? Here you go. Donald Trump has been president for 4 years already. When he was President of the United States, did he weaponize the Justice Department against his political rivals? No, he did not,” Donalds said. “When he was President of the United States, did he order the National Guard or Secret Service or the U.S. military to go after his ‘rivals?’ No, he did not … No, Jim, do you want an answer, I’m gonna give you an answer. You may not like it, but I’m gonna give you one nonetheless.”

Acosta then pointed to Trump’s comment about former golf player Arnold Palmer’s genitalia during a Saturday rally, asking Donalds if that is appropriate speech for a president. Donalds said the American people are more concerned with improving the economy and securing the U.S.-Mexico border than Trump making a crude joke.

“I guess my question is, the larger question is, when you have a president, somebody’s running for president talking about Democrats being the enemy from within, when he’s making lewd comments about professional golfers, doesn’t a candidate’s character matter?” Acosta asked. “Does Donald Trump have the character in your view to be the President of the United States?”

“Well let’s examine that. First of all, I would say, yes he does. You know why? Because he was president and the country was better off when he was president. The world was actually safe when he was president, where there were no new world wars when he was president. So he did a very good job, the American people remember that,” Donalds replied.

Over 2 million illegal migrants have been encountered by Border Patrol in the 2024 fiscal year, and nearly 100 individuals on the U.S. terror watch list have been released into the U.S. during the Biden-Harris administration. Donalds further brought up the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan which led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members, whom Trump honored during an event commemorating the third year of their deaths.

As Election Day nears, one issue stands out as a potential game-changer: the significance of crime in key swing states, which may just be the catalyst that tips the election toward Donald Trump.

Amid ongoing political debates, crime has become a growing concern for voters, particularly so in key battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. As safety takes center stage, the Biden-Harris administration’s policies face increased scrutiny.

According to a fresh Washington Post/Schar School poll conducted across key swing states between September 30 and October 15, 2024, crime is a significant issue in the upcoming election for nearly four in five key-state voters. Additionally, former President Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue, with voters trusting him to handle crime better than Harris by a margin of roughly ten points.

Biden-Harris Crime Policy

The Biden-Harris administration has often championed police reform and community-based approaches to crime reduction, with Harris herself having once expressed support for the “defund the police” movement, claiming it “rightly” questioned the allocation of funds to policing over social services such as education and mental health, while noting that increased police presence does not necessarily lead to more safety.

Critics argue that the administration’s soft-on-crime policies and calls to “reimagine” policing are responsible for having weakened law enforcement and emboldened criminals.

“For the past four years, American communities have been forced to live with failed, soft-on-crime policies that have sought to free violent criminals and defund our law enforcement,” lamented Republican Congressman John Joyce of Pennsylvania last month.

Trump’s Law-and-Order Appeal

In contrast, Donald Trump has made “law and order” a cornerstone of his campaign, vowing to “end the lawlessness once again,” while focusing on policies that emphasize support for police and tougher penalties for criminals.

He has also frequently criticized Democratic leaders for fostering an environment that allows crime to flourish. Last month, he accused Harris of having “blood on her hands” caused by the increase in migrant crime in the country.

Despite attempts by the Biden-Harris administration to downplay crime rates, the Trump campaign has accused it of mismanaging crime data and overseeing a dramatic rise in violent crime, with 2022 and 2023 marking two of the deadliest years since 2012. In fact, despite initial reports from the FBI indicating a slight decrease in violent crime in 2022, a quiet revision revealed a 4.5 percent increase, sparking concerns over the transparency of the data collection process.

The campaign also noted that under Harris, violent crime surged to record levels last year, surpassing any year under Trump, with murder rates still higher than before the pandemic.

In August, Trump blasted Harris for what he called a “migrant crime epidemic” on her watch that has severely impacted swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona, among others. The former president posted a series of migrants suspected of crimes like murder, child sexual assault, fatal hit-and-run, rape, and burglary, among other felonies.

In particular, Trump’s posts note that the crimes occurred in critical swing states in this year’s election — the majority of which are thousands of miles from the border with Mexico.

In addition, a recent NBC poll revealed a growing number of voters believe Trump is better equipped to handle crime compared to his Democratic counterpart, particularly in areas where violent crime has spiked — a perception contributing to support in key battleground states.

Election Impact

The seven swing states expected to sway the 2024 presidential election include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Together, they hold 93 critical electoral votes that are set to decide the winner between Harris and Trump.

With slightly over two weeks until Election Day, recent polling data shows Trump making gains in key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia, where he now leads Harris by narrow margins. According to an internal poll from his campaign, Trump is leading Harris in all seven key swing states, ahead by margins ranging from one to five percentage points.

As crime remains a growing concern in swing states, the question is whether voters will choose the candidate they feel can restore safety and security. Trump’s focus on law and order gives him a significant advantage with voters who prioritize crime reduction, while the Harris campaign struggles to address these concerns effectively in the limited time remaining before the election.

This is especially crucial as the Biden-Harris administration has already failed on the global stage.

From the chaotic Afghanistan war withdrawal to the Israel-Hamas war, the administration’s foreign policy has left the world on the brink of World War III. Adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran — once restrained under Trump’s leadership — are now emboldened, raising concerns that a Harris presidency could spell further disaster both abroad and at home.

Ultimately, crime concerns in key battlegrounds, alongside the administration’s foreign policy disasters, could be one of the most significant factors driving voters to the polls — and into Trump’s corner.

A small business owner who has successfully sold millions of infant sleepwear products tells Fox News Digital that her business was derailed by Biden administration actions cracking down on her product category, which she has called "anti-science."

"We had been successfully in business for more than 10 years when we first heard about any rumblings with the government," Manasi Gangan, owner of Nested Bean, told Fox News Digital about her infant sleepwear company. "We had sold more than 2 million products successfully to families across America and when we heard that the line of products were broadly categorized as unsafe, we couldn't believe it."

Gangan, an immigrant small business owner, told Fox News Digital that she started her "innovative line of sleepwear" that "mimics a parent’s gentle touch" after she had trouble getting her second child to sleep.

"All we're trying to do is lend a helping hand to parents who much deserve the rest and sleep and we've been very successful in helping these parents get some good night's rest," Gangan said.

HARRIS TOUTS HER WORK ON THE ECONOMY, BUT WHAT HAS SHE ACTUALLY DONE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES?

In May, Nested Bean’s products, along with similar products made by Dreamland Baby, were pulled from shelves at major retailers like Amazon and Target after a letter from the Consumer Product Safety Commission warning of potential dangers of the weighted sleepwear products.

Gangan told Fox News Digital that the CPSC has not done the necessary due diligence. She said she's done extensive safety research, commissioned a study that showed her weighted products did not hinder infant breathing, and that there has not been a single fatality associated with her product.

"They're claiming that the product is not safe and we are again at a loss as to why, because in the 13 years that we have been developing and delivering these products, their safety has been our number one priority," Gangan said. "We established these products and this innovation into the industry after speaking with safety experts, after taking inspiration and advice from research, neonatal care research, and yet, when we shared this information with this commission, they refused to take heed and are claiming that these categories of products are not safe."

BUSINESS OWNERS SHARE STRUGGLE TO ‘KEEP UP’ UNDER BIDEN-HARRIS ECONOMY: ‘FORCED TO CLOSE’

Some lawmakers, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have gone as far as promoting legislation to ban the category of sleepwear altogether, saying earlier this year , "The stakes are simply too high to allow weighted infant sleep sacks and swaddles to stay on the market without evidence that they are safe."

When reached for comment, Blumenthal told Fox News Digital, "What concerns me most is that these companies may be putting children’s lives at risk. They’ve sold millions of units of products while marketing them as safe in the face of strong opposition from child safety experts."

"Parents and caretakers of newborns are notoriously hard-pressed for rest due to the intermittent sleep patterns of infants, and they need transparent information. Encouraging parents to use these products without clear evidence of their safety and against expert recommendations is dangerous and flat-out irresponsible."

Gangan said she has shared information with Blumenthal’s office and met with his staff to show that her product is not hazardous, but that has "fallen on deaf ears" in what she suggested could be a politically based effort to promote a message that Democrats are looking out for families.

"Intentionally, the senator is providing disinformation to his constituents based on a political agenda," Gangan said. "That's the only thing that I can surmise, that it's an election year."

Blumenthal's office suggested they were open to looking at a "more comprehensive" study from Nested Bean.

Critics of the sleepwear company have cited the American Academy of Pediatrics warning of potential dangers of weighted sleepwear products in a letter to the CPSC and the CPSC has claimed that multiple infant deaths have occurred due to weighted sleepwear products.

The AAP also took issue with a commissioned study that suggested the sleepwear was safe, CBS News reported, by saying it did not test the products in question in real world conditions for extended periods and only tested weights on five babies for two minutes.

3 BIDEN ADMINISTRATION POLICIES HARMING SMALL BUSINESSES

Gangan has argued that CPSC Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. has "inaccurately attributed multiple infant deaths" and cited one coroner’s report in particular that didn’t mention Nested Bean or a weighted product and appears to be related to "a tragic combination of multiple proven-unsafe sleep practices."

"While associations like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have raised theoretical and hypothetical concerns regarding the potential dangers of added weight, there are no studies or incident data that show how, under what circumstances or under how much weight these potential dangers might manifest in weighted products on the market," Gangan wrote in a February letter to Trumka. "On the other hand, there are studies showing effective and safe use of weighted products in hospital settings with the most vulnerable of infants. Nested Bean and other companies are supporting independent studies that will be peer reviewed, to help develop a better understanding of the potential issues involved."

Gangan told Fox News Digital she has met with every CPSC commissioner except Trumka, who she says "does not take meetings," and pleaded her case to no avail.

"We met with the chairman and other commissioners of the CPSC, shared our data research tests that we had successfully completed even before bringing out a single product into the market and since then, the tests that had been completed, to share how a safe product can be brought into the market, how innovation can be brought into the market, hoping to influence regulation, hoping to give data, facts, science to guide regulation," Gangan said. "And instead we were shocked that we were being shut down. So as recently as April of 2024. Despite our multiple attempts at sharing information, being open and honest, Commissioner Trumka wrote letters to retailers pressurizing them to stop the sales of our products and this has been based on no data or science. It's an anti-science attempt to spread misinformation based on personal bias."

A study published in Advances in Neonatal Care journal in 2020 concluded that "no adverse events" occurred with babies sleeping under weighted blankets in 30-minute trial sessions.

In another letter to Trumka, Gangan wrote, "In April 2023, CPSC’s own internal Compliance staff completed an investigation of Nested Bean’s products, sending the company a closing letter stating that no further action was warranted."

Trumka's actions on the infant weighted sleepwear category have prompted pushback from the Republican-led House Small Business Committee, which echoed Gangan's concern.

"Commissioner Trumka failed to take ‘reasonable steps’ to meet the requirements of the statute before he disclosed the identities of the manufacturers of the weighted blankets," Committee Chair Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, wrote in a July letter to the CPSC. "First, he failed to ensure that the information is accurate. Next, he made allegations without the information being backed up by scientific research."

"The Committee is concerned that a single CPSC Commissioner is exerting undue pressure on entities and forcing them to improperly remove small business’ products from their shelves to the detriment of those small businesses. Small businesses deserve a chance to fairly compete in the marketplace without undue influence from the federal government – whether that be through rulemaking or letters from a rogue CPSC Commissioner. America’s small businesses deserve to have their voices heard and considered."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, the CPSC said, "Commissioner Trumka’s activities in this matter were conducted in his individual capacity as a member of the Commission, and not on behalf of the Commission itself."

Gangan told Fox News Digital that starting her business was a pursuit of the "American Dream" and the regulations from the government have crippled that dream and has her questioning the narrative that Democratic administrations support immigrant and minority businesses.

"America is the land of possibilities, that's what the whole world knows America for, so when I came to this country, an immigrant just with a degree and a pocketful of dreams, did very well in my career, decided to take a chance and start this business to help more parents like myself and the values that I have stood for supporting women, supporting small businesses, supporting truth, supporting science data, have been significantly challenged by this action," Gangan said.

"So on one hand, when we hear, 'supporting immigrants, minorities, small businesses and standing for science' and on the other hand, when the administration of the exact same party that I believed in is now threatening, my business, has been devastating for my business. I'm questioning my own beliefs right now. It has been devastating. We have lost 80% of our sales and it has stoked so much fear in our consumers that we are left sharing the same information that was never questioned by our customers before."
A House Democratic incumbent running in a tight race is touting his agreement with Republicans about President Biden’s responsibility on the border crisis.

Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., released a new ad his campaign called his "closing message" emphasizing his willingness to break from his own party.

"My first commander in the Army always said, ‘You're not doing your job right if you don't piss a few people off.’ I guess you could say I took his advice," Ryan began in the minute-long clip.

"Even my own party — when I stood with Republicans and demanded Biden take action to secure our border. It’s a mess. He needs to clean it up."

CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION

He then accused Republicans, including his opponent Alison Esposito, of walking in lockstep with former President Trump.

"Their loyalty is to big donors and Trump. The only flag I pledge allegiance to is the one I wore on my shoulder in combat," Ryan said.

Esposito campaign manager Ben Weiner blasted Ryan in response: "Pat Ryan has been an open-border, pro-sanctuary proponent his entire career."

"This is a lame attempt from Pat Ryan to run away from his pro-illegal migrant record two weeks before an election. Pat Ryan is wrong on all the issues. He has voted against lifting the SALT Cap, supports the radical Green New Deal, and thinks New Yorkers will not recognize that he is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Hudson Valley voters know the real Sanctuary Pat and won't be fooled," Weiner told Fox News Digital.

Weiner also pointed out that Ryan signed an order in 2019 as Ulster County executive stopping local agencies from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Local reports from the time suggest Ryan did halt most cooperation of county employees with ICE, but the Mid Hudson News reported his order "avoids controversial ‘Sanctuary’ language," and the Daily Freeman reported it did not stop law enforcement from working with immigration agents investigating crimes.

New York’s 18th Congressional District includes part of New York City’s northern suburbs and is anchored by the city of Poughkeepsie. It also includes West Point Military Academy, Ryan’s own alma mater.

Republicans, whose 2022 House majority win was driven by victories in the Big Apple's suburbs, have eyed Ryan’s seat as a prime pickup opportunity.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates his seat D+2.

Esposito is a 25-year veteran of the New York Police Department (NYPD).

Her own campaign emphasized the border in a recent ad warning her district is "paying the price of an open border."

"DC politicians are funding illegal immigrants. Who’s fighting for us?" she asked.

But the issue has become a political lightning rod in this election.

What’s long been a hot-button issue for Republicans has now become a metric of moderation for Democrats who are working to appeal to middle-ground voters.

The paradigm shift shows the effects the border crisis has had on cities and towns throughout the country, with apprehensions between ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border hitting record levels under the Biden administration.
Former President Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has opened up a sizable advantage in the election betting odds in recent weeks, giving Americans a new way of trying to piece together what might happen come Election Day.

"More than two billion dollars have been bet on the election already," Maxim Lott, who runs ElectionBettingOdds.com, told Fox News Digital.

The comments come as Lott’s website, which uses data from five different betting sites to display a betting average, shows Trump has a 58.5% chance of winning the presidential election as of Monday.

Lott’s website isn’t the only one tracking the betting odds, with popular sites such as RealClearPolitics, which has become known over the years for tracking polling averages, joining the fray.

TRUMP OPENS UP LARGEST BETTING LEAD SINCE DAYS AFTER BIDEN'S DROPOUT

Like ElectionBettingOdds.com, the RealClearPolitics betting average shows Trump as the favorite with a 59% chance to win the election as of Monday.

Trump’s chances of winning the election have dramatically risen over the last few weeks, with his Democrat opponent, Vice President Harris, being the betting favorite on RealClearPolitics as recently as Oct. 4. But Trump took the lead the next day and hasn’t looked back, eventually rising to the nearly 20 percentage-point advantage the former president enjoyed on Monday.

For Lott, looking at betting averages gives people a much clearer picture of what the most likely outcome of the election is compared to trying to piece together polls.

"These are really accurate, they’re more accurate than just trying to look at polls or especially more accurate than listening to pundits bloviating," Lott said.

"[The bettors] look at all sorts of historical data, they look at trends," he added. "I find the percent more useful than the polls."

Lott, who previously served as a program executive producer for the Fox Business Network, also noted that people risk their own money to make a bet on an outcome, creating a market that has the ability to "discipline people" who get it wrong.

"If you’re not very smart, or very biased, you’re going to lose your money pretty quickly, and then maybe you won’t bet again next election," Lott said.

While betting on elections is newer than more well-known gambling pastimes such as sports betting and casino games, Lott said the market has become robust enough to offer election followers a glimpse into what the most likely outcome will be.

"Last cycle we had more than a billion dollars traded. That’s still [not] that much if you compare it to … the stock market or something, but it’s enough that we have a reliable indicator, and that’s what [is] important to us as users who just want to know what’s going to happen," Lott said.

As for Trump’s lead, Lott said it likely reflects an end to the "honeymoon period" Harris enjoyed after being elevated as the Democrat nominee, noting that Trump had risen to around 70% likely to win the election before President Biden dropped his bid for re-election and has bounced back into the lead once again.

"Things have kind of reverted back to the mean where – it is a tough cycle for Democrats with things like inflation and immigration, and so maybe for a couple months people were like, ‘Oh, Harris, this is interesting, this is new, this is refreshing,’ and then it’s kind of sinking in: 'This is the same administration we didn’t like with Biden," Lott said.
The Democratic Party is losing its edge over the GOP in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, with Democrats changing their party affiliation at more than twice the rate of Republicans, according to state data released after voter registration ended Monday evening.

A total of 9,088,583 registered voters were tallied across the state when the sign-up period ended at midnight on Monday. Registered Democrats maintained a lead over registered Republicans at 3,971,607 registered Democrats to the GOP’s 3,673,783.

More than 1.4 million voters are registered as third-party or independent voters in the Keystone State.

Though the Democratic Party accounts for nearly 44% of registered voters compared to the GOP's 40%, it has seen its advantage over Republicans dwindle this year.

BIDEN'S OLD BACKYARD NOW A KEY PENNSYLVANIA BATTLEGROUND FILLED WITH 'PURPLE' VOTES

In 2020, there were 9,090,962 registered voters across the parties in Pennsylvania, only slightly more than the 9,088,583 voters registered this cycle.

President Biden won the state in 2020 by 1.17 percentage points​. That year, Democrats had a larger margin of registered voters compared to their Republican counterparts, at 4.2 million to 3.5 million. The data show that Democrats had a registration advantage over Republicans by 685,818 voters during an election Biden won by 80,555 votes.

The GOP has whittled down that lead this year to a 297,824 margin. When comparing registered voters this election year to 2020, Democrats face a net loss of 257,281 voters, while Republicans have a net gain of 428,537 registered voters.

The Trump campaign on the ground in Pennsylvania celebrated the data, saying "Kamala Camp HQ is no doubt asking what the heck their 400 paid staffers and 50 offices in Pennsylvania have been doing this whole time, since their only output seems to be drumming up some meaningless stories about office openings and their supposedly well-oiled ground game."

'BLUE WALL' DEMOCRAT ALIGNS WITH TRUMP IN NEW PITCH TO VOTERS BEFORE ELECTION

More than double the number of previously registered Democrats changed their party affiliation this cycle compared to the number of registered Republicans who left the party: 54,668 registered Democrats changed their party affiliation compared to 25,634 Republicans, Pennsylvania Department of State data shows.

The data is broken down by county, with Philadelphia notably reporting 18,928 Democrats changed their party affiliation compared to just 3,401 Republicans doing the same. Bucks County, which sits outside of the City of Brotherly Love, reported 2,089 Democrats changed their party affiliation compared to 1,624 Republicans. In Allegheny County, home to the state's second-largest city of Pittsburgh, 6,564 Democrats changed their party affiliation while 2,202 Republicans did the same.

The registered voter data comes after reports surfaced that concerns were mounting within the Democratic Party that the Harris campaign is failing to effectively connect with voters in Pennsylvania.

Poor campaign management and staffers lacking relationships with Democratic political leaders in the Keystone State are allegedly rocking the campaign, Politico reported last week. The outlet reported that Democrats are worried that the campaign’s state manager lacks an understanding of Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, while campaign staffers have allegedly not invited local Democratic politicians to events in the state, and have not effectively deployed surrogates.

KAMALA HARRIS 'HAS BECOME TOXIC' FOR PENNSYLVANIA, TOP KEYSTONE STATE LAWMAKER SAYS

Politico reported that it spoke with 20 Democratic politicians, allies and party leaders for the story and that they were restless over Harris’ campaigning efforts.

"Our campaign is running the largest and most sophisticated operation in Pennsylvania history," Harris’ national campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodriguez said in comment to Fox News Digital when asked about the report last week. "While Trump’s team still refuses to tell reporters how few staff they have in the state, we have 50 coordinated offices and nearly 400 staff on the ground."

"While the Trump campaign closed its ‘minority outreach offices,’ we invested in targeted advertising to Black and Latino voters starting in August of 2023 and have now spent more than any previous presidential campaign on outreach to these communities. The Vice President is also campaigning aggressively in Pennsylvania – spending 1 out of 3 days in the state in September."

Vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey made national headlines last week when he distanced himself from Democratic Party leaders and launched a campaign ad detailing how he "bucked Biden" and "sided" with former President Trump.

The ad features a married couple – Republican Marygrace and her Democrat husband Joe – praising Casey as an "independent," citing his support for Trump's trade policies and efforts to "protect fracking" from the Biden administration.

INEFFECTIVE PLANNING, LACK OF CONNECTIONS HAS DEMS ON EDGE IN 'KEY' BATTLEGROUND: REPORT

"Our marriage – pure bliss! But on politics, we just don’t agree. Except for Bob Casey. He’s independent," Marygrace says, with her husband chiming in, "That's right!"

"Casey’s leading the effort to stop corporate greedflation and price-gouging," Marygrace continues. "Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating. So in this house, we agree, it’s Bob Casey who’s doing right by Pennsylvania."

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

Casey has served in the Senate since 2007, ultimately becoming a stalwart within the Democratic Party, voting on legislation Biden supported, for example, 98.5% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight data. He is now facing his toughest re-election effort yet, as he squares up against Republican challenger Dave McCormick.

The Fox News Power Rankings score the presidential contest in Pennsylvania as a toss-up, with the Senate race a lean Democrat designation. The Cook Political Report, this week, however, shifted the Senate contest from a leans-Democrat race to a toss-up race, underscoring Casey’s difficult re-election battle.

Pennsylvania is touted as the state that will likely determine the outcome of the general election on Nov. 5. A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters published late last month found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by two points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.

Top Judiciary Republicans are accusing a controversial Biden-Harris administration official of violating the Hatch Act by touring the country with Democratic politicians ahead of the pivotal November elections.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, claimed Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan could be guilty of engaging in partisan political activity in her official capacity, which is prohibited under the Hatch Act.

"According to recent reports, you appeared at a series of events in Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Arizona with several candidates for elected office. Media accounts described your tour as a ‘campaign gauntlet’ with the timing of your events ‘so near the election… hard to ignore,'" the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent on Monday to the chair.

"These campaign-style events create the appearance that you are using your official position to advocate for the election of certain Democrat candidates."

PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE LABELED 'TOSS UP' IN LAST-MINUTE SHIFT BY TOP HANDICAPPER

The Biden-Harris FTC chair has become a fan favorite among the more progressive contingent of the Democratic Party. However, she has also become a point of contention among the coalition trying to elect Vice President Kamala Harris. While some politicians are staunch supporters of Khan and her actions against Big Tech and other industries to prevent supposedly anticompetitive behavior, a number of Harris' wealthy donors have pushed for her removal, putting the vice president in the middle.

Khan has been hyper-vigilant of business moves, not hesitating to take on players in the tech, health care and grocery industries. In fact, Jordan has characterized her wielding of the FTC against businesses as harassment regarding her actions against X, owned by billionaire Elon Musk.

Earlier this month, she joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, as well as Texas labor leaders and workers, for a discussion on worker freedom.

During the same week, she was a guest in Illinois at a "fireside chat" with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., where they discussed grocery prices and health care, among other topics.

Khan also made an apparent surprise visit to the swing state of Wisconsin, where she spoke to residents about the potential sale of a county-owned nursing home.

"We’ve been watching with some alarm as more and more mergers and consolidation mean that fewer and fewer players are coming to control important parts of the health care system," she told Wisconsinites during the visit.

However, this wasn't the only swing state the chair stopped in. She also joined Rep. Ruben Gallego in Pheonix, Arizona, to discuss rising rent prices. Gallego is notably in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country.

While all the events were billed as official business and not campaign functions, the timing, locations, topics and people involved caught the attention of both Jordan and Lee. With less than two months until the general election, the official events with Khan deserved scrutiny, according to the lawmakers.

The Republicans said, "This concern is particularly significant given your history of ignoring agency ethics advice concerning the appearance of partiality along with your subsequent dishonest testimony on the subject, and the numerous complaints from FTC staff that your mismanagement has made you the bottleneck that has prevented the FTC from successfully protecting consumers and bringing successful cases."

Jordan and Lee further requested Khan to provide all communications regarding the scheduling of the various events, as well as the funding for travel and accommodations. They also asked that she produce documents and communications regarding any guidance she was given by the FTC’s Designates Agency Ethics Official on doing public events with candidates.

The FTC declined to comment when reached by Fox News Digital.

Former President Donald Trump is edging ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris among Arab-American voters, a poll released Tuesday shows.

Overall, the 2024 election will see a massive turnout among Arab-Americans, which the poll projects to reach 87 percent.

The Arab News/YouGov poll found 45 percent of respondents said they are most likely to vote for the Republican nominee in 14 days time, while 43 percent would likely vote for Harris.

Another four percent said they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, while six percent said they were undecided and another two percent declined to reveal their choice.

The poll lists the state of the Israel-Hamas War and the Palestinian cause as a top priority, with 29 percent of voters seeing the conflict as the primary issue, followed by the cost of living and the economy.

Trump is also perceived as more likely to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, beating Harris 39 percent to 33 percent on that question.

That correlates with Trump suggesting to Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya News on Sunday that his sources from Lebanon were telling him that Israel needed to continue its war against Hezbollah and defeat the Iran-backed terrorist organization, as Breitbart News reported.

According to the survey, Arab-Americans primarily perceive their votes to hold consequence in the November election, with 80 percent of voters polled believing their choice matters.

The survey was conducted using a sample of 500 Arab-Americans across the U.S. from September 26 to October 1, 2024. The survey data have a margin of error of +/- 5.93 percent.
The president of International Christian Concern (ICC), an organization that documents and advocates against Christian persecution around the world, urged Christians in America to vote for former President Donald Trump in a statement Monday, arguing that any “conflicted” personal feelings about Trump do not erase his “second to none” record defending religious freedom.

ICC president Jeff King added that, independent of Trump’s merits, the American left has adopted stances that have “marginalized and silenced Christians,” becoming an authentic threat to American religious freedom.

King’s statement, issued to reporters in a press release on Monday, was in response to the recent publication of a report by Arizona Christian University finding that a little over half of “faith voters” are planning to vote in the 2024 presidential election.

“That means a full 104 million faith voters are unlikely to vote this election — including 41 million born-again Christians (defined by their beliefs regarding sin and salvation, not self-identification), 32 million regular Christian church attenders, and 14 million who attend an evangelical church,” researchers noted. Dr. George Barna, who conducted the study, described potential Christian apathy as a potential “game-changer” for the results of the election.

“To my fellow conflicted Christians, politics is a messy and noxious affair, and no leader will fully embody Christian morality,” King said in his statement. “The simple truth is that we aren’t voting for a pastor; we’re choosing a flawed human being who we hope will respect and govern within a constitutional framework.”

While conceding that he is “conflicted” by Trump as a person, King credited the former president with having “built a religious freedom team that was second to none in modern politics.” Trump, he continued, also “appointed justices to the Supreme Court who have upheld religious freedoms and protected constitutional values that align with biblical principles.”

“Like you, I am conflicted by Donald Trump. But I’m much less conflicted by the Left and how they have marginalized and silenced Christians and sought to literally revoke our nation’s religious freedom for the sake of one of their factions,” King added. “What worries me most though is that all the tricks I’ve seen used overseas by tyrants to marginalize and silence Christians are being practiced in the United States by the Left.”

“We must learn from the past, and to a certain degree, grow up. We must not retreat from the public square. For if we disengage, we will get what we deserve (just as we are now),” he concluded.

ICC works to both advocate for protection for Christians persecuted abroad and to raise awareness of the harrowing situations millions of Christians face across the globe. The group has for years warned in particular about the violent situation in Nigeria – repeatedly named the most dangerous place to be a Christian despite nearly half of the population being Christian. ICC also works in places such as India – where Christians face violent attacks by Hindu nationalists and Muslim extremists – as well as Pakistan, China, Indonesia, and North Korea.

President Trump prioritized religious freedom advocacy as a formal policy of his White House, establishing January 16 as “Religious Freedom Day” and creating an international alliance for religious freedom bringing together a diverse set of nations including Brazil, Israel, Ukraine, Gambia, the United Kingdom, and Togo.

At home, Trump asserted in declaring the creation of a religious freedom day, “[N]o American — whether a nun, nurse, baker, or business owner — should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law.” Abroad, Trump centered religious freedom as a foreign policy directive.

“Religious freedom, America’s first freedom, is a moral and national security imperative,” Trump declared in an executive order in 2020. “Religious freedom for all people worldwide is a foreign policy priority of the United States, and the United States will respect and vigorously promote this freedom.”

Trump also advocated for religious freedom on international stages, including the United Nations. In 2019, the former president delivered an unprecedented speech urging fellow U.N. member states to prioritize defending religious minorities within their borders.

At that event, Trump said:

As we speak, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Yazidis, and many other people of faith are being jailed, sanctioned, tortured, and even murdered, often at the hands of their own government, simply for expressing their deeply held religious beliefs. Today, with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution, to stop the crimes against people of faith, release prisoners of conscience, repeal laws restricting freedom of religion and belief, protect the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed. America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts.

Under outgoing President Joe Biden, Christian persecution and religious freedom generally dropped far below the level of priority that Trump had elevated it to during his tenure. Biden particularly outraged religious freedom advocates in 2021 by removing Nigeria from the State Department’s list of countries of particular concern for religious freedom. Christians in Nigeria face outsized jihadist violence from terrorist groups such as Boko Haram and the ethnic Fulani terrorists in the center of the country. Some international observers suggested the removal of Nigeria from the list was not related to the actual situation on the ground in Nigeria but, rather, an attempt to bring the country closer to the United States after years of China successfully enhancing its influence there. Religious freedom advocates nonetheless expressed outrage, calling the move a “baffling error.”

In Nigeria, Christians lamented the erasure of their suffering.

“I am educated enough to know that America needs allies in the world … but our appeal would be that it shouldn’t be at the expense of Christian lives and the blood of innocent people,” Father Remigius Ihyula, a Catholic priest serving the Middle Belt of Nigeria, told Breitbart News in July 2023.

Biden’s extension of the 20-year-old Afghan War, leading to the return of the Taliban jihadist organization to power, also dramatically increased persecution of Christians and other minority religious groups in Afghanistan.

“We are telling people to stay in their houses because going out now is too dangerous,” an Afghan Christian leader reportedly told ICC in 2021. “Some known Christians are already receiving threatening phone calls. In these phone calls, unknown people say, ‘We are coming for you.’”

In July, ICC President King described Biden announcing he would not run for reelection as a cause for hope for religious freedom advocates.

“While President Trump is a very polarizing figure, during his presidency, the U.S. became a focused and effective champion pushing for religious freedom around the world,” King said at the time. Trump’s team’s “effectiveness in promoting religious freedom around the world was unmatched in decades (if ever),” he added.

Former President Donald Trump is maintaining a small lead over Vice President Kamala Harris among an unlikely demographic as her campaign reportedly worries about her chances in key swing states, according to a new Arab News/YouGov poll obtained by Semafor.

In a new Arab News/YouGov poll, 45% of Arab American voters said they are more likely to vote for Trump, compared to 43% who said they will likely vote for Harris. More Arab Americans, 39%, think Trump will “successfully resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict,” compared to Harris who has 33% of the community’s support on this question, the poll shows. Two weeks before the election, the Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the “blue wall,” such as Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

“There has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off,” a senior Harris campaign official told NBC News, emphasizing that there are real concerns over her path to victory if Michigan goes for Trump while Wisconsin and Pennsylvania stay blue.

Of likely Arab American voters, 4% of respondents said they would cast their vote for third-party candidate Jill Stein and 6% said they were still undecided, according to the poll. Arab News/YouGov surveyed 500 Arab Americans nationally between Sept. 26 and Oct. 1 2024 and the poll has a margin of error of 5.93%.

🧵 President Trump took to Truth Social to voice concerns that Arab-Americans are disaffected with Kamala Harris. The Daily Caller recently did a deep dive on dissatisfaction with Harris in Muslim communities in Michigan that touched on some of the same concerns. pic.twitter.com/QQS0X3zGwt — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 21, 2024

Muslim Americans in Michigan are making an effort to flip the state for Trump in protest of the Biden-Harris administration’s Middle East policy. One activist organization, Drive for 75, has calculated that if 75% of its community can turn out to the polls then the vice president has a 99.9% chance of losing, Rex Nazarko, who is heading up the effort, previously told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)

“What was a guarantee for [a Harris loss] to happen? We tried with different percentages and different turnouts, and with the 75% number, again, accounting only for the Muslim community, not other communities, not other allies, not other progressives. It essentially guaranteed a 99.9% likelihood of the vice president losing the election in Michigan, if 75% of [the community turned out],” Nazarko told the Caller, explaining that they ran numerous mathematical simulations to inform their strategy.

“We ran that simulation 10,000 times, and almost every time that was the case. So that’s how we got the Drive for 75 call to action and idea,” he explained.

As a part of the effort to flip the state, Muslim activist organizations are pushing their community to vote for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, or even Trump, they told the Daily Caller. Abandon Harris, one of those groups trying to spoil Harris’ election chances, threw its support behind Stein, who also has the backing of some socialist groups in the U.S. due to her anti-capitalist economic positioning.

“We need to be clear about what our goals are, we are not in a position to win the White House. But we do have a real opportunity to win something historic. We could deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan,” Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council Member and self-described socialist, said to cheers at a recent rally for Stein.

A Harris campaign spokesperson denied NBC News’ report that there were concerns over their ability to win Michigan.

“We absolutely are competing to win Michigan,” Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told NBC News, pointing to the vice president’s recent stops in the state. “We think we will win Michigan.”

The vice president has recently campaigned across key swing states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin alongside former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.

Alongside Cheney, her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney previously endorsed Harris, though the endorsement might not have the positive effect the campaign is hoping to have, one Michigander told the Caller.

“Here’s the new thing going around, people are saying that, ‘hello, she’s been endorsed by Dick Cheney.’ That tells you everything you need to know about this woman: that her intentions are war,” Vice chair of the 12th Congressional District Republican Committee Stephanie Butler, who is married to a Muslim, told the Caller.



Trump took to TruthSocial Monday to give a message to Arab and Muslim American voters ahead of the election on Harris’ Middle East policy.

“Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris, the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States and a Low IQ individual, is campaigning with ‘dumb as a rock’ War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind,” Trump wrote.

“If Kamala gets four more years, the Middle East will spend the next four decades going up in flames, and your kids will be going off to war, maybe even a Third World War, something that will never happen with President Donald J. Trump in charge. For our country’s sake, and for your kids, Vote Trump for PEACE!” the former president wrote.
Abortion remains one of the biggest issues Christian voters face on the ballot, and many are demoralized by former president Trump’s moderate stance — as it will result in the lives of more innocents being taken.

Since Kamala Harris and her VP pick, Tim Walz, are drastically more radical on the topic of abortion, many of those voters don’t see a choice that reflects their values and are threatening to sit out of the election.

President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Dr. Albert Mohler is of the mind that sitting this election out is not the answer.

“We’re called to a very long fight here. We’ve got to stay in the fight, and that means that we’ve got to be honest about the political alternatives in an election like 2024,” Mohler tells Allie Beth Stuckey of "Relatable."

“When it comes to the Harris-Walz ticket, you’re talking about absolute unbridled support for abortion at any point up until birth, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, quite frankly, aggressively supported with all the power of the administrative state. On the Republican side is a very different picture, and frankly, we need to be honest about those two stark alternatives,” he continues.

Stuckey is in complete agreement, noting that a future Harris-Walz administration views abortion as a “fundamental right” that should not be left up to the states.

“I noticed just in their animation, Kamala and Walz in the debates, that this is really what they’re most excited about. This is when they kind of become most articulate, it’s when they sound the most knowledgeable. When they are talking about abortion, their fervor just comes out in full force,” she explains.

While the United States Constitution recognizes certain rights as inalienable, Stuckey and Mohler both understand that the Democrat ticket plans to recognize abortion as one of those.

“From the Christian worldview, there are certain human rights that the government doesn’t create, it just recognizes and agrees to honor, and that’s ridiculous when it comes to abortion on both counts, because there is no society throughout all of human history that has somehow come to the claim that abortion is a fundamental, inalienable right,” Mohler says.

“Governor Walz, he signed one of the most aggressively pro-abortion bills in all of, I won’t say American history, all of world history, in which there’s absolutely no restriction on abortion, period. The bill that he supported and signed into law in the state of Minnesota,” he continues, adding, “I think he means what he says, and that’s what scares me the most.”

As head of Wisconsin’s Government Accountability Board (GAB), Kevin Kennedy helped lead one of the more sinister, secret investigations of the century. Kennedy and his corrupt “good government” agency worked alongside highly partisan Democrat prosecutors in Milwaukee and Dane counties to conduct a years-long probe via a star chamber against then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker and his conservative allies. Activated under Wisconsin’s old John Doe law, prosecutors and government agents spied on their victims, terrorized them with pre-dawn, armed raids, and threatened them with hefty fines and jail time if they dared to say anything publicly about the investigations — including defending themselves from false accusations from anonymous “sources” in the stories GAB-friendly corporate media outlets pumped out.

So it’s interesting that the State Bar of Wisconsin would host a continuing legal education event for attorneys on election integrity, the constitution and the rule of law featuring Kennedy — a government bureaucrat lifer who twisted election integrity, trampled on the constitution and smashed the rule of law through his central role in Wisconsin’s unconstitutional John Doe investigation.

“Having Kevin Kennedy teaching the rule of law to a law class is like having Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas teach a class on securing the southern border,” Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., told The Federalist in a phone interview.

Tiffany was a state senator in 2015 when he introduced a bill that ultimately reformed Wisconsin’s John Doe law, checking the use of secret political investigations.

Perhaps the State Bar session featuring election integrity advice from a good friend of IRS former top conservative witch hunter, Lois Lerner, should come as little surprise from a left-leaning legal association accused of violating its members First Amendment rights.

‘Democracy is Calling’

The State Bar has scheduled the continuing legal education session, billed as Wisconsin Election Law and the Citizen Lawyer for Wednesday afternoon at the State Bar Center in Madison. The session is worth 3 CLE credits and is free to those who attend in-person, $59 for the live webcast.

“With the 2024 general election fast approaching, Wisconsin will likely see high voter turnout in a highly charged political climate. But lawyers are uniquely suited to play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of elections and increasing public confidence in the results — all while upholding the rule of law,” an event announcement states.

“Democracy is calling. Will you answer?” the subject line of the announcement asks in an email obtained by The Federalist.

The training session is being produced in partnership with the liberal Carter Center, founded more than 40 years ago by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to promote “democratic institutions, global development” and to monitor elections around the world, according to nonprofit tracker InfluenceWatch. The center is the beneficiary of generous grants from left-leaning foundations, including leftist sugar daddy George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.

Kennedy will be joined by former state Sen. Kathy Bernier, a RINO former county clerk and state senator who lost the faith of her constituents by failing to understand the left’s penchant for gaming the election system.

“Whether you volunteer at the polls, educate the public, or engage in election-related litigation, Wisconsin Election Law and the Citizen Lawyer will empower you to defend the right to vote, the rule of law, and the Constitution,” the State Bar proclaims in the ad.

Kennedy, according to the flyer, has worked in elections for more than 45 years, serving as “Wisconsin’s Chief Elections official for more than 30 years.”

“No other individual has served longer in that role,” the announcement states. “Wisconsin has been consistently recognized as a leader and innovator in the administration of elections, lobbying, and campaign finance.”

Joe Forward, communications director for the State Bar of Wisconsin, said the continuing legal education program includes a “subject matter expert on election law,” aka Kennedy.

“These panelists were selected because of their experience with and knowledge of election law and the election process,” Forward said in an email response to The Federalist’s questions.

What the folks at the State Bar of Wisconsin and the Carter Center fail to note is that Kennedy was effectively drummed out of his leadership post in 2016 after his Government Accountability Board was dissolved because of its repeated misinterpretations of election law and for the GAB’s involvement in the infamous John Doe probes.

“Kevin Kennedy should be on a democracy offender registry not teaching a course on democracy. He shouldn’t be allowed within fifty feet of democracy,” said Adam Gibbs, longtime Wisconsin politico and communications director at the Foundation for Government Accountability. “He should be required to notify his neighbors about violations he committed while abusing his position of power.”

‘I Felt Completely Helpless’

Deborah Jordahl and her family certainly will never forget Kevin Kennedy and his prosecutor allies. As I wrote in a 2016 piece for the Washington Times, “the sun had yet to rise when deputies carrying warrants pounded on Mrs. Jordahl’s front door in a quiet suburb of Madison.”

Armed officers led by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm’s investigators rooted through the possessions of Jordahl and her family, seizing paper records, smartphones and other electronic devices, among other private possessions sought in the multi-agency John Doe political probe driven by Kennedy and his henchmen.

As I originally reported for Wisconsin Watchdog at the time, Jordahl, her husband, and their teenage children were confined to the home’s family room for several hours, guarded by a Dane County deputy. Her heart broke as she watched her 15-year-old daughter in pajamas sitting on the couch and crying as a deputy warned the girl not to tell her friends at school about the raid.

“At one point early on, I started to get up from the sofa,” Jordahl said. “I told the deputy who was guarding us that I wanted to call my lawyer. She backed me down on the sofa and told me I could not call anyone.”

“I felt completely helpless in my own home,” Jordahl said of the coordinated raids of Oct. 3, 2013.

Wisconsin’s John Doe investigations operate much like a grand jury. Unlike a grand jury, a John Doe is overseen by a judge who works more closely with the prosecution. And secrecy orders prevent targets from talking about the investigation outside of the courtroom or judge’s chamber. At the time, the probes could be used to secretly investigate whether an alleged political crime had been committed.

The abusive investigations more than a decade ago targeted dozens of right-of-center groups and scores of conservatives like Jordahl. The activist had long used her voice to speak out for conservative principles and candidates. Then Kennedy and crew under the pretense of a “campaign finance” investigation silenced her speech — on penalty of incarceration.

In one sweeping raid that morning, armed police pounded on the home of a conservative activist whose 16-year-old son was home alone.

“To his horror, he saw uniformed officers, their guns drawn. ‘Police,’ they yelled. ‘We have a warrant.’ An officer shined a flashlight on a document (he) couldn’t read. Unsure what to do, but unwilling to defy the authorities, he let them in,” National Review reported. “The officers sat him down, read him the entire search warrant, and ordered him not to tell anyone about the raid — not even school officials. He asked if he could call his parents. They said no. He asked if he could call a lawyer. They said no.”

‘Kevin Kennedy Must Go’

Eric O’Keefe, conservative activist and target of the John Doe probe, received what he has described as a “kitchen sink subpoena.” O’Keefe fought back, risking being imprisoned to tell the public about the abuses he and fellow conservatives were being subjected to — all in the name of politics and power.

In an interview with The Federalist, O’Keefe said he finds it “really obnoxious” that Kennedy is being put up on a pedestal as a beacon of integrity and the “rule of law.”

“This is a guy whose department backed and encouraged a process that included pre-dawn, armed raids on family homes of people who committed no crimes,” he said. “That’s the guy who is ‘defending democracy’? Why doesn’t he give that talk in Tehran?”

While none of the perpetrators of the unconstitutional investigations was ever held accountable, legal battles did bring damning emails and other communications of government agents to light. Dave Craig, a southeast Wisconsin state representative at the time, filed an open records request that harvested nearly 140 pages of emails between Kennedy and Lois Lerner, the disgraced former director of the Internal Revenue Service’s Exempt Organizations division. Lerner’s weaponized division was caught targeting conservatives and right-of-center nonprofits based on their ideology.

A 2015 piece by the Wall Street Journal editorial board headlined, “Wisconsin’s Friend at the IRS: Emails show a common cause in restricting political speech,” included some of the more alarming communications between Lerner, whom Kennedy described as a longtime friend.

“Wisconsin’s campaign to investigate conservative tax-exempt groups has always seemed like an echo of the IRS’s scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. It turns out that may be more than a coincidence,” the Journal column began.

Republican lawmakers said the emails “exposed a coordinated effort” by Kennedy and Obama appointee Lerner.

“It is clear that the harassment of conservative groups by Lerner at the federal level directly coincided with the harassment of conservative groups right here in our state,” state Sen. Alberta Darling and state Rep. John Nygren wrote in a statement at the time. “We have completely lost confidence that the GAB can be trusted to operate in a non-partisan manner for the citizens of the state of Wisconsin with Kennedy in charge, In order for the GAB to return to its original mission, Kevin Kennedy must go.”

And go Kennedy did, along with the corrupt GAB. The agency’s longtime leader departed knowing the state Senate would never confirm him for a position in the GAB’s successor agency. Fed up, the Republican-led legislature shut down the corrupt elections regulatory board. Republicans, however, replaced the GAB with the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC), which brought over many of the same agents from the old regulator. WEC has been accused by conservatives as being as partisan as its predecessor.

“The fact that the State Bar of Wisconsin invited Kevin Kennedy to teach a free continuing education course about ‘protecting democracy’ shows how co-opted they have become and how committed the Left is to turning lawyers into activists,” Craig, who now serves as legal Director at the Foundation for Government Accountability, told The Federalist in an email.

In August, a federal judge ruled that a free speech lawsuit brought against the Wisconsin State Bar may proceed, Reuters reported. Wisconsin attorney Daniel Suhr, represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, argues that the bar association is violating his First Amendment rights through its mandatory dues covering diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Compelling membership dues pay for such programs, Suhr argues, is unconstitutional.

As election day approaches and polls narrow, out-of-state groups are pouring tens of millions into Florida to enshrine abortion as a right in the state’s constitution.

Massive Democratic-aligned dark money networks, the Soros family, D.C.-based liberal advocacy groups and public-sector unions have rallied behind Floridians Protecting Freedom (FPF), spending millions to support the group’s effort to repeal Florida’s prohibition on abortion after fetal heartbeats are typically detected, campaign finance records show. FPF is the primary group supporting an initiative on November’s ballot to amend the state’s constitution by creating a constitutional right to terminate one’s pregnancy.

To be added to the state’s constitution, the amendment would need to attract 60% support on election day. A poll in June found that 69% of voters supported that amendment, though an October poll recently found that just 60% of voters reported supporting the abortion initiative, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

“Now, just barely reaching the 60% it needs to pass, it looks like the fate of abortion in Florida will come down to turnout on Election Day,” University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder told the Tallahassee Democrat.

While FPF brands itself as “grassroots,” it has been relying on deep-pocketed out-of-state liberal organizations to shore up pro-abortion turnout ahead of election day. All told, out-of-state groups have spent well over $40 million boosting the pro-abortion amendment, dwarfing outside spending from pro-life organizations opposing it.

Sixteen Thirty Fund, for example, donated $304,300 worth of research services to FPF in July, according to campaign finance records. Arabella Advisors, a shadowy D.C.-based consulting firm, manages Sixteen Thirty Fund as part of a multi-billion dollar dark money nonprofit network. Sixteen Thirty Fund and the rest of the nonprofits under Arabella Advisors’ umbrella have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years pouring money into Democratic political committees, funding climate lawsuits, bankrolling left-of-center activist groups and paying for voter mobilization efforts targeted at left-leaning demographics.

In addition to conducting research for FPF, Sixteen Thirty Fund also donated $1 million to the pro-abortion campaign on May 31, records show. New Venture Fund and Hopewell Fund, two other nonprofits managed by Arabella Advisors, collectively donated about $11.8 million to FPF between Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.

The Tides Foundation, another large liberal grantmaker that has been accused of dealing in dark money, donated about $3.5 million to FPF between December 2023 and September, according to state records. Tides, which is based in San Francisco, directs its funds towards mobilizing pro-Democratic voters and pro-abortion activism, among other left-of-center initiatives.

Liberal dark money groups have supported similar abortion ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan. Many Democratic strategists see November’s abortion referendums as an opportunity to sway voters to their side in the presidential election.

“Dark money” typically refers to organizations that involve themselves in political campaigns without disclosing donors’ identities. None of the nonprofits in Arabella’s network nor the Tides Foundation publicize the identities of donors, despite the organizations being involved in electoral politics.

“Florida regularly rejects the dark money D.C. establishment, and unsurprisingly, these groups are spending tens of millions in an attempt to turn Florida into California and buy influence,” a spokesperson for the campaign opposing the abortion amendment told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But no amount of money will convince Floridians that non-doctors should be able to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, that a child can undergo an abortion without parental consent, or that taxpayers should pay for abortions, which Amendment 4 would allow.”

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that Amendment Four would legalize abortion “until the moment of birth.” The text of the amendment prohibits the state’s legislature from restricting abortion before fetal viability, which is generally considered to occur around 24 weeks and would give healthcare providers the right to perform an abortion at any point in a pregnancy if they believe doing so would “protect the patient’s health.”

At 23 weeks, an unborn child is about a foot tall and has arms and legs, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.

Working hand-in-hand with Democratic dark money operations, public unions have been using dues collected from taxpayer-funded salaries to fight for a constitutional abortion guarantee in Florida, according to campaign finance records. Various branches of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents public-sector workers, have pumped considerable funds into FPF from outside of Florida.

Chapters of the SEIU in New York, Connecticut, D.C., California and Washington state collectively gave over $1 million to FPF, records show. The SEIU represents both public and private sector employees.

Federal law prohibits unions from contributing membership dues directly to political campaigns, according to the Department of Labor. They can, however, contribute revenue from membership dues to political committees like FPF. Under current Supreme Court precedent, public employees cannot be compelled to join a union and pay dues as a condition of employment.

Though it is cashing massive checks from out-of-state unions and dark money behemoths, FPF is adamant that it is running a “grassroots” operation.

“We will work every day to build on the already unprecedented grassroots support this campaign has received from allied organizations, volunteers, and funders to educate voters and strengthen public support ahead of the election,” an April press release from the group reads. The term “grassroots” appears multiple times on the organization’s website, with FPF touting purported organic local support for its efforts.

The New York-based Soros family, one of the largest funders of liberal campaigns across the country, pumped $5.5 million into FPF’s self-described grassroots campaign between September 2023 and September 2024, records show. Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Justice for All, two of the largest pro-abortion groups in the country, both of which are headquartered outside of Florida, have donated $2.5 million to FPF. Other D.C.-based activist groups have donated over $16 million to FPF this election cycle.

Florida Freedom Fund, a PAC founded by DeSantis to fight the abortion initiative, by contrast, has only raised a couple hundred thousand dollars from out of state organizations, campaign finance records show. Florida Voters Against Extremism, another group opposing the amendment, has also raised just a few hundred thousand from out-of-state groups, much of which came from Catholic organizations.

FPF did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Republicans in two key battleground states were hit by twin legal setbacks Monday, after judges in Michigan and North Carolina rejected their efforts to crack down on overseas voting from U.S. residents living abroad, criticizing both the short timeline and the proposed remedy sought by the plaintiffs.

A claims court judge in Michigan described the effort as an "attempt to disenfranchise" voters living overseas, while a Superior Court judge in North Carolina said the plaintiffs "presented no substantial evidence" to back their claims that the current laws do not go far enough to protect against election fraud.

The two separate court rulings come just weeks after Republicans in Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina filed lawsuits aimed at restricting both the registration and vetting process for overseas voters.

Republican plaintiffs argued that current law makes it possible for these residents to register and vote in elections without proper identification. That contention has been fiercely rejected by Democrats, who argued the level of vetting sought by Republicans would disenfranchise "tens of thousands" of voters abroad, including U.S service members and their families.

FLURRY OF PRE-ELECTION LEGAL CASES IS NOW 'STANDARDIZED' STRATEGY, EXPERTS SAY

Judges in U.S. battleground states appear to back this line of thinking, following two separate decisions filed Monday.

In Michigan, the Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel rejected plaintiffs' effort to invalidate a rule that allows spouses and dependents of U.S. service members stationed overseas to vote at that person's former home address, even if they never lived in the state themselves.

Patel criticized the timing of the GOP-led lawsuit, which was filed just 28 days before the election, and said it would result in "extreme prejudice" for would-be voters and election administrators.

"Consistent with federal law, the Michigan Legislature made a policy choice to allow a small pool of individuals who accompany family members abroad to qualify as Michigan residents for the purpose of voting in Michigan because they are connected to Michigan through their spouse, parent, or someone serving a parental role," Patel said, adding that "It is hard to imagine a more prejudicial situation arising from plaintiffs’ delay."

Patel further noted that the law for overseas voters has been in place for 12 years and had gone unchallenged until now.

FLURRY OF PRE-ELECTION LEGAL CASES IS NOW 'STANDARDIZED' STRATEGY, EXPERTS SAY

And in North Carolina, Wake County Superior Court Judge John Smith dismissed the GOP lawsuit that pushed for similar rules for absentee voting and spouses of U.S. service members, noting that the current statute for overseas voting had been adopted in 2011 with bipartisan support, and "has not been challenged until the filing of this complaint and motion."

Further, he said, plaintiffs "have failed to show any likelihood of irreparable harm" as a result of the voters in question.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: VOTER OUTREACH, BALLOT EFFICIENCY AND A LITTLE HOUSEKEEPING

In Pennsylvania, judges are expected to rule on three separate lawsuits Republicans have filed in recent weeks seeking to restrict overseas voters and their registration under the 1986 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which oversees the voting process for U.S. residents living abroad.

Democrats, for their part, have criticized the legal push as a last-minute effort by Republicans to restrict voter turnout from a demographic that has until recently been a reliable bedrock of GOP support.

More than 1.2 million overseas ballots were cast in the 2020 election, according to data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.

And in a dead-heat sprint to Election Day, these voters could play a pivotal role in the race's final outcome. All three states are considered "toss-up" states in the 2024 election, and could prove pivotal in picking the next president.

"Election-denying extremists, afraid they are losing this election, are actively working to disenfranchise members of our military deployed outside of the United States," Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a Pennsylvania Democrat and Air Force veteran , told Fox News.
The U.S. election might hinge on voters currently residing tens of thousands of miles away, according to new estimates from the Democratic Party – prompting a flurry of new efforts to mobilize voters abroad and, they hope, swing the election in Vice President Kamala Harris' favor.

According to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), an estimated 1.6 million U.S. voters living overseas are eligible to vote in one of seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. The states, which carry a combined total of 93 Electoral College votes, are considered to be crucial in deciding the next president in an increasingly tight race.

Now, with Harris and former President Trump locked in a virtual dead heat just two weeks before Election Day, this bloc could carry more influence than ever.

Democrats, for their part, are wasting little time in seizing upon what they see as a crucial demographic of U.S. voters overseas.

NEBRASKA HIGH COURT RESTORES VOTING RIGHT FOR THOUSANDS OF CONVICTED FELONS

Earlier this year, the DNC announced a $300,000 investment in the group "Democrats Abroad," aimed at helping mobilize U.S. voters overseas.

The investment is a first-of-its-kind donation from the DNC during a presidential campaign cycle, a spokesperson told Fox News.

It seeks to ramp up voter registration efforts by U.S. voters overseas, educate residents about registration and mail-in voting operations, and widely mobilize the population. They have also taken out ads on social media.

Voters living overseas do face additional challenges in casting their votes, which must be submitted – often by mail – to the state in which they are registered.

U.S. voters abroad do historically vote at a much lower rate in national elections when compared to their counterparts on U.S. soil.

Additionally, 47% of military voters living abroad participated in the 2020 election but just 8% of non-military voters cast their ballots from overseas – a statistic Democrats are hoping to change.

In an email to Fox News, a spokesperson for the DNC noted that President Biden's narrow 44,000-vote advantage in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin helped carry him to victory in 2020.

FLURRY OF PRE-ELECTION LEGAL CASES IS NOW 'STANDARDIZED' STRATEGY, EXPERTS SAY

Abroad voters had a notable difference in at least two of those states – Georgia and Arizona – and also played a key role two years later in the outcome of the close 2022 midterm races.

Now, as the race tightens even further in its final weeks, Democrats see this bloc as potentially offering Harris a winning edge.

"This election will be won on the margins, and every single vote counts," DNC deputy communications director Abhi Rahman told Fox News in a statement.

The push comes as Republicans in at least three swing states have sought to crack down on overseas voting in the final sprint to Election Day. The Republican National Committee and state-level groups in Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina have filed lawsuits this month seeking additional restrictions on a vetting and verification process they argue is devoid of proper safeguards.

Though federal law defers to individual states to establish their own election rules, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act tasks the secretary of Defense with implementing the registration and voting for U.S. service members and government employees living abroad.

As of this writing, two judges in Michigan and North Carolina rejected the lawsuits, which they said were devoid of evidence and risked disenfranchising voters.

Democrats, for their part, have criticized the legal push as a last-minute effort by Republicans to restrict voter turnout from a demographic that has until recently been a fairly reliable bedrock of GOP support.

"We’re going to win this election by engaging every eligible voter, no matter where they live," Rahman told Fox News, adding that their investment "shows our commitment to leaving no stone left unturned."
More than 1 in 4 Georgia voters have cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election so far.

The Peach State has been smashing pre-Election Day turnout records and is expected to be a critical factor in the White House contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 1.8 million of Georgia’s some 7.2 million active voters cast absentee or early in-person ballots, or 25.2%.

'ILLEGAL, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID': GEORGIA JUDGE STRIKES DOWN NEW ELECTION RULES AFTER LEGAL FIGHTS

"Another milestone reached," Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, wrote on X.

"At 1:30, 25.2% of active voters in Georgia have cast their ballots. That is more than 1 in 4 voters, with 9 more mandatory days of Early Voting to go. These are amazing numbers. Congratulations to our counties for their work and voters for theirs."

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have poured enormous time and resources into Georgia, a state President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.

On the first day of early voting alone, Georgians cast more than 313,000 in-person ballots. That was 123% higher than the previous Day 1 record, according to Sterling.

And the single-day vote total on Sunday wound up being nearly twice the number seen on the first Sunday of early in-person voting in 2022.

White voters made up the largest share of that total so far, followed by Black voters. Georgia women also slightly outnumbered men in the pre-Election Day tally by 55.3% to 44.4%.

The former president will partake in a religious event in rural Georgia on Wednesday, according to WRBL, followed by an evening rally in Duluth.

Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., blasted billionaire X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, calling him a "dips---" during a rally in swing state Wisconsin on Tuesday with former President Barack Obama.

"I'm not going to waste all the time on him," Vice President Harris' running mate told the crowd in Madison, Wisconsin.

"I'm going to talk about his running mate," he said. "Elon Musk."

"Elon's on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dips--- on these things," he said, likely referencing Musk's appearance at a rally for former President Donald Trump.

"That guy is literally the richest man in the world, spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election," the Minnesota governor told the crowd.

According to Walz, Trump is "promising corruption" in front of Americans, claiming he has promised to put Musk in charge of the regulatory bodies that oversee his businesses.

Journalist and CNN contributor Kara Swisher has repeatedly downplayed the Twitter Files, the suppression of the New York Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story and has made many unproven accusations about public figures.

Swisher came under fire Friday for suggesting there is “no proof” that tech companies colluded to suppress the New York Post’s story reporting on the existence of Hunter Biden’s laptop ahead of the 2020 election, though it has been known that Big Tech communicated with the FBI to freeze the Post’s account and suppress the story. Swisher has publicly made several unproven suggestions about “X” owner Elon Musk and conservatives.

“There is no proof that tech companies colluded to do this, this is nonsense … I have been one of the biggest critics of tech, this is nonsense,” Swisher said, leading to pushback by CNN’s Scott Jennings. “Absolutely nonsense.”

WATCH:

The New York Post’s account got locked for seven days by Twitter after they published an Oct. 15, 2020, story containing emails allegedly from Biden’s laptop indicating that he and his father, President Joe Biden, met with a Ukrainian executive from the oil company Burisma. The social media company also locked former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s personal account after she shared the story.

Swisher suggested without evidence that Republican nominee Donald Trump declined to participate in more debates with Vice President Kamala Harris because of his “cognitive challenges” during an Oct. 5 segment on “The Chris Wallace Show.”

“This last week, there’s been several appearances where his cognitive challenges are clear and so when he’s pushed in any way or when that debate happened with Kamala Harris he has issues,” Swisher said.

WATCH:

During an interview with former CNN host Don Lemon in March, Swisher called the Twitter Files “a ridiculous waste of time” that never found evidence of suppression. (RELATED: ‘He’s Going To F*cking Lose’: Bill Maher Spars With Liberal Journalist Over Biden’s Reelection Chances)

“I think [Musk] got so obsessed with those Twitter Files and found exactly nothing or small examples of stupid decision-making on the part of Twitter. But those Twitter Files were just a ridiculous waste of time for everybody because you never really find what you’re looking for,” Swisher said.

The Twitter Files, which began in December 2022, were an account by Musk and journalists such as former Rolling Stone editor Matt Taibbi detailing how the former executives of Twitter intentionally suppressed the New York Post’s report on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Taibbi disclosed how the FBI warned Twitter of a potential “hack-and-leak” by “state actors” surrounding the laptop story to influence the 2020 presidential election, while journalist Michael Shellenberger found in mid-December that that the FBI paid Twitter nearly $3.5 million between October 2019 and February 2021 to compensate for the time employees managed the agency’s requests.

The prominent journalist told Lemon that Musk is “promoting” the great replacement theory, a belief that lax immigration policies for non-white immigrants is an attempt to replace white people. Musk, who said he “does not subscribe” to the theory, has been accused of promoting the theory for stating that illegal immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to support Democrats.

“I look at what [Musk] tweets and look, at the very least, he’s promoting it for sure, and I haven’t seen him promote the other side which is this is nonsense,” Swisher told Lemon. “If he’s very interested in a real debate which he isn’t, he would promote both sides.”

Swisher and Lemon also both suggested that Musk was uncomfortable with him because he is “gay.”

The journalist chuckled at her co-host Scott Galloway’s joke about former first lady Melania Trump supporting the assassination attempt on her husband on July 13 during a July 16 appearance of her podcast, “Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway.”

“I don’t know if you heard, but right before Melania gave her public statement, she was heard yelling into a phone, ‘You had one job!’ Too soon?” Galloway said, right after criticizing conspiracy theories about the shooting.

“No, I like a joke. My favorite joke was the one where they said let’s hope it’s not a time traveler from the future who can’t shoot … Alright, we’ll stop with the jokes,” Swisher responded.

Swisher expressed her opinion that Fox and News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch is “the single most destructive force in America, England and Australia” for allegedly having “created a sort of tsunami of disinformation” during an interview September interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. She referred to Fox News reaching a $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in April 2023 over allegations that the network “deeply damaged” their reputation in the aftermath of the 2020 election.

“I actually think [Murdoch] is the most destructive force in America, England and Australia,” Swisher told Amanpour. “It’s a little bigger than that, but that’s stuff his publications have done and his power has done. But, it is in its waning days … Combined with gerrymandering, and social media, it’s created a sort of tsunami of disinformation, not understanding what truth and lies are, of tabloidism which I think has been around longer … But I think it’s really created this really cynical idea of facts.”

In media, Rupert Murdoch is “the single most destructive force in America, England and Australia,” argues @karaswisher, though the empire “is in its waning days.” He “created a sort of tsunami of disinformation… I would say it’s laziness, but I think it’s deliberate.” pic.twitter.com/Vl4KHde9Hb — Christiane Amanpour (@amanpour) September 28, 2023

Swisher also once accused NBC News’ Dasha Burns, without evidence, of playing into “GOP efforts” by stating that then-Democratic Pennsylvania senate candidate John Fetterman had difficulty making “small talk” during their interview in October 2022, suggesting Fetterman simply had a “bad day.” Fetterman suffered a nearly-fatal stroke in May 2022 that made it difficult for him to speak and process words at a normal rate.

Swisher didn’t immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Democrats are waking up to the nightmare that the 2024 election is not trending well for Vice President Kamala Harris.

While there are different avenues for both presidential candidates to win enough Electoral College votes to take the White House, Harris must win the three states that make up the “blue wall:” Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. These states, also known as the “Rust Belt,” flipped to Trump in 2016 but went blue in 2020 with President Joe Biden and are still Harris’ best chance of winning in 2024.

🚨Blue Wall danger: Worry grows among top Dems that Harris is stuck, even sliding a bit, after strong convention & debate •Her media blitz, spending advantage & largely favorable coverage don’t seem to be moving the needle much, if at all, these Dems say https://t.co/SkRtsv2xlt — Mike Allen (@mikeallen) October 10, 2024

Pennsylvania will likely be crucial to Harris’ victory with its 19 Electoral College votes. Still, Harris’s path in Pennsylvania is not trending as well as it did for Biden, reportedly keeping local Democrats up at night.

“The registration gap between Republicans and Democrats has absolutely collapsed in Pennsylvania over the course of the past few years, and particularly in 2024. And a significant number of those registrations that are changing are Democrat to Republican,” Charlie Gerow, a longtime political operative in Pennsylvania, told Politico. (ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness)

“Early voting is another indication. Democrats have always dwarfed Republicans because Republicans prefer to vote in-person and most of them do. But Republicans have caught on to the fact that if you bank your vote, it’s guaranteed to be cast. And so the Republican request for mail-in ballots is way, way up this year and the Democrats’ numbers simply aren’t as good.” Gerow added.

Philadelphia City Councilmember and chair of “Black Men for Harris Pennsylvania,” Isaiah Thomas, admitted that Gerow was correct. This is problematic for Democrats as they watch Harris’ slim lead in the state collapse.

“I want to be very clear: What Charlie talked about is definitely something that’s extremely alarming and concerning. It’s a pattern that existed long before I became a member of city council,” Thomas told Politico, adding that is why the Harris Campaign has stepped up its ground game in the state.

“I think that there are warning signs around voter participation,” Thomas said.

“The concern is there. Just because I’m confident that we’re going to win doesn’t mean that I go to sleep every night without a high level of anxiety. The anxiety is there. The fear is there,” he added.

Democrats and Harris have reason to be concerned. Not only are Republicans gaining on Democrats in voter registration, but the deadline to register new voters in Pennsylvania ended Monday night. Couple that with Republicans’ mail-in ballot returns outpacing their 2020 numbers, and Democrats’ fears are justified. (ROOKE: In Fewer Than 10 Words, Brian Stelter Lays Bare Democrats’ White Liberal Ignorance Problem)

Republican activist and founder of Early Vote Action Scott Presler reported that in the last week, Democrats’ voter registration advantage dropped by another 14,901 voters. If you exclude inactive voters, Democrats only have a registered voter advantage of 130,848.

I cast my early vote for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance Monday morning. Business was brisk at the Virginia polling station as it has been across the country. Virginia’s state elections are "off-year," so the big early turnout here is really about the interest generated in the presidential race—bolstered by the Senate candidacy of Captain Hung Cao (USN, Ret.)

Republicans are running six veterans for Senate this year, and they all have a chance to win. Cao, who was a Special Operations Officer (Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Deep Sea Diving), is closing on Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia as Trump momentum picks up in the Commonwealth, assisted by the non-stop efforts of popular Governor Glenn Youngkin. If Senate seats were selected on the basis of merit and diversity, Cao would be a shoo-in.

Indiana Congressman Jim Banks is a Navy veteran who did reserve duty in Afghanistan for a year while serving in Indiana’s state senate. Banks has all but been declared the winner but he is running through the tape.

Captain Sam Brown was medically retired from the U.S. Military as a Captain after graduating from West Point and being deployed to Afghanistan where he was grievously injured by an IED. The Purple Heart recipient is behind incumbent Democrat Jackie Rosen but Trump’s appeal in the Silver State may help Brown pull off an enormous upset.

In Montana, Tim Sheehy is solidly ahead in the polls, and will likely defeat incumbent John Tester early on election night. Sheehy, a United States Naval Academy graduate, completed several deployments and hundreds of missions as a Navy SEAL Officer and Team Leader, deploying to Iraq, Afghanistan, South America, and the Pacific region. Since leaving the Navy Sheehy started the very successful Bridger Aerospace and its sister company, Ascent Vision Technologies.

Another service academy grad is David McCormick, who is a West Point alum and a former member of the 82nd Airborne Division. McCormick is in a statistical tie with incumbent Bob Casey, Jr. who’s fallen behind McCormick in some polls primarily because Casey is a down-the-line Biden supporter. Pennsylvania has been moving right for two decades even as Casey moved left.

DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S MCDONALD's VISIT SERVED UP FOUR BRILLIANT POLITICAL MOMENTS

Virginia’s Cao is also a naturalized American, one of two Senate GOP candidates who were born in countries other than the U.S. and who came through the legal immigration process. The other is Ohio’s Bernie Moreno, who was born in Columbia and whose family emigrated first to Florida when he was a child. Moreno has climbed into a tie with forever politician Sherrod Brown who left Yale 50 years ago and promptly went into the Ohio legislature and has never not been on the government’s state or federal payroll since then. Brown is a hard left vote in the Senate, but for decades and decades the last name of Brown meant gold on Election Day in Ohio, but it is Moreno with the momentum and the sparkle in this race. Brown is old, looks tired and is out of step with the ruby red Buckeye State.

Republicans are also competitive with more traditional GOP candidates but in states that are usually lay-ups for Democrats.

In Maryland the popular former governor Larry Hogan is going to benefit even in deep blue Montgomery County because of his steadfast support of Israel.

Businessman Eric Hovde has Wisconsin incumbent Tammy Baldwin begging the national Democratic Party to send help. Kari Lake is gaining on Ruben Gallegos in Arizona as voters focus on the genuinely radical—not "liberal" or "left wing" but radical—Gallegos. Nella Domenici has a shot at taking back her late father’s place in the U.S. Senate from Mexico. And the upset of the year is likely to be in Michigan, where former FBI agent and Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers is the strongest candidate the Republicans have offered the Michigan electorate in decades. Rogers began his adult life with a four-year stint as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He went right from the Army into the FBI and then Congress.

The ground may be shifting nationally towards Trump as Vice President Harris’s panicked shift from a cloistered castle of a campaign to a cluster-up goat rodeo of interviews has sent her supporters back to the bench in droves. Could she turn it around in the last two weeks? Perhaps. But she’d have to do some impressive and difficult interviews to pull that off. It’s possible. Just not likely.

A senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee is demanding an explanation from the Department of Justice (DOJ) on why a potential assassin was able to threaten U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon for months.

On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe of the Southern District of Florida asking why law enforcement officials took four months to indict a would-be assassin of Cannon.

“On September 25, 2024, Eric James Rennert was indicted for making violent threats to assault, kidnap, and murder U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed charges against former President Trump related to his handling of classified information,” Grassley wrote. “However, according to the indictment, Rennert began making threats against Judge Cannon and her family as early as May 25, 2024.”

In July, Judge Cannon tossed the federal government’s charges brought against former President Donald Trump in Florida after DOJ stormtroopers raided his Mar-a-Lago residence two years ago. Court filings show the FBI was authorized to use “deadly force” to conduct the raid that allowed agents to confiscate any record Trump might have interacted with as president. Judge Cannon ultimately dropped the charges after finding prosecutor Jack Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional.

Judge Cannon’s reluctance to fast-track the unprecedented proceedings throughout the criminal case against the former president put a target on her back by Democrats desperate for a conviction before the November election. Just before Judge Cannon effectively killed the chance for a trial this summer, anonymous sources demanded through interviews with The New York Times she recuse herself and have a colleague preside over the high-profile case.

According to the indictment cited in Grassley’s letter, Cannon received threats about her safety in May, but the man behind them was not indicted until September. Attacks against the judge from left-wing activists had also begun to escalate in May as Cannon came under pressure to accelerate the prosecution of the Republican presidential nominee.

[RELATED: Judge Aileen Cannon Is The Latest Object Of Democrats’ Recusal Obsession]

“The indictment says on or about May 25 and May 28, 2024, Rennert communicated ‘a true threat to kidnap and injure’ Judge Cannon and her family,” Grassley wrote. “The indictment says that Rennert also threatened to ‘assault, kidnap, and murder’ Judge Cannon ‘with the intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere’ with her ‘performance of official duties’ and ‘with the intent to retaliate’ against Judge Cannon for performing those duties.”

Grassley’s letter also highlighted that on “July 24, 2024, Rennert again threatened to murder Judge Cannon for all the same reasons.” Trump had just been shot at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania 11 days prior, on July 13. The former president survived another attempt by a gunman who lined up a scoped “AK-47-style rifle” within just 300 to 500 yards of where he was golfing.

“The Justice Department didn’t indict Rennert until September for these criminal threats, even though Judge Cannon has faced consistent violent threats for carrying out her constitutional duties,” Grassley wrote. “Why did it take the Justice Department four months to bring charges against Rennert during which time former President Trump faced two assassination attempts?”
Americans’ trust in the media is in the tank — and the hack-tivist “journalists” who have spent years contributing to the trend are not taking it well.

On Tuesday, former CNN political reporter Chris Cillizza lamented findings published in a recent Gallup survey that show Americans’ overall confidence in “mass media” has been in decline for years. The analysis indicated that in 2024, just 12 percent of Republicans, 27 percent of independents, and 54 percent of Democrats “say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media” to report the news “fully, accurately, and fairly.”

Overall, in 2024, 36 percent of respondents said they have “no trust at all” in media, while 33 percent expressed having “not very much” trust and confidence.

“Devastating. And a massive problem for a healthy democracy,” Cillizza whined on X alongside a photo of results from the Gallup analysis. Cillizza also indicated yesterday that he believes the controversy surrounding “60 Minutes” allegedly distorting its sit-down interview with Kamala Harris is “dumb.”

Cillizza’s melodramatic performance may sit well with his legacy media cohorts. But for anyone who’s been paying attention to the past decade of press coverage, it’s all smoke and mirrors.

When talking heads like Cillizza claim Americans’ waning trust is “devastating” for “democracy,” what they’re actually espousing is their fear that the media is losing its ability to control what information the public is allowed to receive and how it’s portrayed.

For years, these self-professed “news” outlets have dominated the information sphere with little competition from conservative and independent media or from free speech platforms like X. They frame nearly every major news story from a left-wing perspective, ultimately advancing the Democrat Party agenda.

While Cillizza unsurprisingly declined to mention in his Tuesday post on X how this dynamic has contributed to Americans’ lack of trust in the industry, CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell recently provided a clear-cut example of why corporate media can no longer be trusted to deliver objective, unbiased news.

During the opening of her Monday night program, O’Donnell provided a synopsis of Harris and Donald Trump’s recent 2024 presidential campaign activity. In typical left-wing activist fashion, O’Donnell gave a glowing account of Harris barnstorming in rust-belt swing states with her new wacky sidekick Liz Cheney to convince “disaffected Republican voters” to back her flailing candidacy.

After reporting that Cheney that day called Harris “a responsible adult,” O’Donnell characterized Trump’s campaign activities as such:

As for former President Donald Trump, he was back in North Carolina — again, pushing false claims about FEMA and immigrants. That’s after he spent the weekend slinging a crude insult at Harris, engaging in lewd locker room talk about the late golfing legend Arnold Palmer, and staging a campaign stunt at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s.

Recall that O’Donnell was one of two “moderators” hand-picked by CBS News to pander to Tim Walz during the 2024 vice-presidential debate. It was clear to any objective person who watched the Oct. 1 spectacle that helping Walz — not impartiality — was their top priority.

What Americans experienced during the debate and throughout recent years is not an industry devoted to the truth, but Democrat activism. These so-called “journalists” have weaponized the First Amendment right to a free press to advance the very ideology that seeks to undermine that right and others documented in the Constitution.

Contrary to Cillizza’s assessment, Americans’ skepticism and lack of confidence in our current media aren’t “devastating” for the republic; they’re necessary for its very survival.

Western civilization cannot function when its media’s primary objective is protecting the interests of the state. A real press devoted to providing the unvarnished truth to the people ensures accountability throughout government and society writ large.

Cillizza and his ilk can shoot off disingenuous tweets about Americans’ declining trust in media until the cows come home. But until they start acting like the press our founders envisioned, the people have every right to view them as the left-wing propagandists they are. Failure to do so only ensures an accelerated collapse of what’s left of our republic.

The United Kingdom’s Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) intends to “Kill Musk’s Twitter,” according to internal documents obtained by The DisInformation Chronicle and Matt Taibbi’s “Racket.”

Morgan McSweeney is a British political operative providing advice to Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the report. He was a former board member of the CCDH, according to InfluenceWatch. His LinkedIn page says he served as the organization’s company director until April 2020. McSweeney attended this year’s Democratic National Convention (DNC) to speak with members of Vice President Kamala Harris’ team, Politico reported.

The CCDH documents obtained by Chronicle reveal one of the group’s chief priorities was to “Kill Musk’s Twitter,” and the group also intended to meet with Democratic Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar’s team. “Kill Musk’s Twitter” is the first order of business in the CCDH’s monthly agenda plans which go back to January 2024, according to screenshots in the report.

Sen. Klobuchar’s office did not respond to the Chronicle’s request for comment.

Politico dubbed the UK’s left-wing Labour Party and the Democrats as “sister parties.” Recently, a Labour Party official announced on LinkedIn that about 100 current and former party staff would campaign on the ground for Harris, the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) reported. The posts have since been deleted. (RELATED: State Department Worked With Fact-Checkers, Academics To Censor Conservative Media, Report Says)

McSweeney was promoted this month to Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, the BBC reported. (RELATED: UN Takes Cues From Orgs That Seek To Censor Conservatives)

The CCDH targets “disinformation” and is the means of communication for Labour’s think tank, Labour Together, according to the Chronicle. McSweeney was also previously director of Labour Together, according to his LinkedIn page.

Other objectives of the organization include “Trigger EU & UK regulatory action” and “Progress towards change in USA and support for STAR,” according to the documents.

STAR is a framework for policymakers to adopt for social media regulation, according to the CCDH’s site. STAR would create an “independent digital regulator” to enforce online safety mandates, documents from the organization read. The U.K. implemented the Online Safety Act, which faced criticism for potentially jeopardizing privacy, in 2023, WIRED reported.

The CCDH met with federal legislators while advocating for “change in USA” and pushing STAR, according to the Chronicle.

As the American public focuses on a this-close presidential race, political operatives and Washington insiders are preparing for something that appears more certain: the return of a Republican Senate majority.

That majority is coming with the aid of former President Donald Trump.

It’s size also rests with the fate of Trump.

Democrats have known for two years that their 51-49 hold on the Senate would be incredibly difficult to maintain in 2024.

West Virginia, Montana and Ohio are the last red states to have long-time Democratic senators, and it just so happens that all three seats are in the mix in the same year when Trump will be juicing Republican turnout to epic levels.

The easiest state, West Virginia, was made easier with the retirement of Sen. Joe Manchin.

Recent reports have Republican Gov. Jim Justice up by more than 30 points on his challenger in the race for the seat being vacated by Manchin.

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana who’s managed to outmaneuver opponents for multiple cycles looks to have met his match with Navy Seal Tim Sheehy.

Initially close, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Sheehy up 7 points.

Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, viewed by many as the toughest red-state Democrat to beat, is seemingly slipping under the weight of Ohio’s red-tilt with Trump at the top of the ticket.

On Thursday, Axios reported that two separate polls have Moreno up anywhere from 1-3 points. While the RCP average still has Brown up by 0.6 points, these latest polls present an ominous trend for the long-term senator less than three weeks from the election.

Barring any unlikely incumbent Republican losses, these three pickups give Republicans a clean 52-seat majority.

While there are other senate races in play, three in Democratic strongholds have emerged as unexpected battlegrounds, and it just so happens to be the three that hold the keys to the presidency.

Because of Trump’s strength with blue collar union voters, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin present real pickup opportunities for Senate Republicans.

Democrats entered this cycle with confidence in Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania because of their experience and fundraising — but as Trump’s numbers grew, their numbers shrank.

Baldwin is now in the fight of her political life with businessman Eric Hovde, while Dave McCormick is nipping at Casey’s heels.

Michigan’s open Senate seat pitting Rep. Elissa Slotkin against former Rep. Mike Rogers is neck-and-neck with Rogers’ own internal polling showing him down only one point.

Trump’s political strength is underscored by Baldwin, Casey and Slotkin using Trump in their own political advertising.

Beyond using Trump on TV, Casey is rarely seen with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania when she’s campaigning there.

Not only is this a stark about-face for someone that has been one of Trump’s critics but also a particularly ominous sign for Senate Democrats and the Harris campaign.

Decisions like these on a campaign are not made in a vacuum. Casey needs Trump voters to win and hanging out with Harris isn’t going to cut it.

Slotkin is even publicly sending warning flares to the Harris campaign that Harris is “underwater.”

Trump’s team – the best he’s ever had – is projecting a quiet confidence.

Harris, on the other hand, is scrambling – sitting for interviews she eschewed for the first 60 days of her campaign, attempting to win back the support she has lost in the African American, Latino and blue-collar communities of these states.

Crucially, these states almost always vote the same in presidential elections. Trump won them in 2016, then Biden in 2020.

Trump’s proven ability to bring out low propensity voters is also troubling for the Democratic campaigns.

A shift of only a percentage or two will mean victory.

Those who do come out for him overwhelmingly help carry down ballot Republicans to victory.

If Trump manages to pull off the trifecta, he will be in the White House again and more than likely three new Republican senators will be coming to Washington in 2025.

The difference between a 52-seat majority and a 55-seat majority cannot be overstated.

Senate Republicans will have a level of power they have not possessed in many years, and Trump will return to Washington with an even bigger mandate.

Four days after Election Day is the over/under for when Fox News will likely declare a presidential election winner, Arnon Mishkin, the head of the network’s decision desk, said.

Mishkin’s prediction indicates the race will be too close to call for several days after the election, a predicament that mirrors the 2020 election.

“The over/under is Saturday,” Mishkin told Politico. “Which was when the call was made last time.”

Mishkin is technically a consultant for Fox News and not an employee of the network. He has worked with Fox News since 2008 and infamously defended Fox News’s early call in 2020 for Biden in Arizona.

Mishkin explained his prediction:

I think we had a pretty good understanding of how they were going to report [in 2020]. What we don’t know now — but we kind of knew then — was that there was going to be an enormous skew in the vote type. I believe that Joe Biden won every state in the mail-in vote with the exception of Alabama — and that Trump won every state on Election Day with the exception of Vermont and maybe Connecticut. I can’t remember exactly, but there was a huge skew. I think that skew is going to be less this time. I don’t know how much less. I know it’s still going to be there, but the Republicans are doing a much better job of encouraging people to vote however they want. … The race seems very, very close. It is dependent on a number of states, like Pennsylvania, that we believe are going to be reporting in a pattern similar to the way they have reported in the past. So I’d say, the over/under is Saturday. Which was when the call was made last time. Which is when Pennsylvania is likely to come in. I think we have to accept the reality that we don’t really know how close this election is going to be. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be close. I see some polls that say, “Actually, it ain’t going to be close. It’s going to be one way or the other.” There’s some reporting that Trump is sort of gaining. Some of the polls have showed he’s gaining. There’s another sense I have that actually he may be declining. I think the real issue is what happens to Trump. I’ve always thought this about this election: It’s less about who’s running against him than it’s about Trump.
A migrant caravan is heading northward toward the United States a few weeks before Election Day, the results of which will almost undoubtedly spell changes for border enforcement policies, according to The Associated Press.

A roughly 2,000-person strong migrant caravan left southern Mexico on Sunday in hopes of reaching the U.S. in the coming days, according to the AP. The latest caravan is so far the largest since newly-elected Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum entered office in October. (RELATED: Police Arrest Venezuelan Illegal Migrants In Connection To Murder, Tren De Aragua Connections Suspected)

Among those in the caravan are individuals who expressed concern that a new administration in Washington, D.C., would lead to the end of a popular app that has allowed hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals to schedule appointments with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in hopes of entering the country.

“That is what makes us fearful,” Joel Zambrano, a Venezuelan national, said to the Associated Press. “They say this could change because they could both close the CBP One appointment and all the services that are helping migrants.”

This will be the third caravan that has been created under the new administration of the new president of Mexico. An… pic.twitter.com/UjtFyHefVq — Oscar El Blue (@Oscarelblue) October 20, 2024

The CBP One app was first created in October 2020, with the Biden-Harris administration dramatically expanding its use in January 2023. The popular app enables migrants to schedule appointments in order to obtain exemptions at ports of entry, and permits them to submit biometric data to federal immigration authorities in order to apply for travel authorization and obtain parole.

More than 800,000 non-citizens scheduled appointments through the CBP One app from January 2023 through the end of August 2024, according to CBP. The Biden-Harris administration has additionally flown in more than half a million foreign nationals into the country via an initiative known as CHNV — a program that grants two-year parole to Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan nationals.

Roughly 7.4 million migrants have illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, according to the latest data from CBP.

While the CBP One app and an election-year crackdown on illegal immigration by the Mexican government has helped keep migrants in southern Mexico, many are reportedly leaving the region due to a delay in asylum appointments and a lack of job opportunities.

“The situation in my country is very bad, the president doesn’t do anything for us. We spent a week by the border, but getting documents takes time,” Honduran Roberto Domínguez said to the Associated Press. “The documents we get are only for us to be in Tapachula and we cannot leave the city.”

Despite an attempt to brand herself as more of a border hawk since launching her presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris has consistently polled poorly with voters on border enforcement issues following her administration’s oversight of a historical border crisis. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, has pledged to hire 10,000 Border Patrol agents, give them a 10% pay bump and wage a large-scale deportation effort.

Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for focusing on attacking former President Donald Trump instead of being “clear about what she believes.”

In a post on X, Phillips, who previously ran as a candidate in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary before dropping out in March, wrote that Harris will have wasted “a billion dollars” from “losing voters” by focusing more on condemning Trump.

WATCH — 15 Days Until Election: The One Thing Donald Trump Told Breitbart’s Matt Boyle:

Phillip’s post included a photo of a New York Times article titled “Starring in Kamala Harris’s Closing Argument: Donald Trump.”

“A billion dollars will have been wasted on losing voters by condemnation versus winning them by invitation,” Phillips wrote. “She just needed to be clear about what she believes, what she will do differently than Biden, and offer common sense solutions to our problems.”

Phillips added that “instead” Harris was making Trump a focus in the final days of her campaign, referencing the photo of the New York Times article.

The New York Times noted that, as the presidential election approaches, Harris has been focusing more on attacking Trump’s “erratic behavior and increasingly outlandish and antidemocratic statements” in an effort to “paint him as unfit” and “unstable”:

Deploying his words as her sharpest weapons, Ms. Harris is pointing to Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior and increasingly outlandish and antidemocratic statements to paint him as unfit, unstable and, above all, too dangerous for another term. It is a closing argument she is hoping will persuade the dwindling number of undecided voters to help her defeat him.

Harris’s focus on attacking Trump as the election gets closer comes as several polls, and a recent Decision Desk HQ/the Hill election forecast found that Trump is either leading Harris or locked in a tie with her.

The Decision Desk HQ/the Hill election forecast found that there was a 52 percent chance of Trump winning the election, while Harris received a 42 percent chance of winning the election.

A recent NBC News poll found that Trump and Harris were locked in a tie with 48 percent of support from registered supporters.

The poll also found that 43 percent of voters viewed Harris positively, while 49 percent viewed her negatively. This represented a decrease in Harris’s popularity from September when 48 percent of voters viewed her positively, and 45 percent viewed her negatively.

As Breitbart News reported, NBC News poll analyst Steve Kornacki spoke with NBC Today host Savannah Guthrie about how Harris had lost a five-point lead that she had over Trump.
Kamala Harris is trying to convince Democrats and independents to support her. That seems standard enough, except we’re just two weeks away from Election Day — and Democrats’ much-loved early voting has been under way since September.

Persuasion is an essential part of any campaign, of course. The problem for Harris is that she’s still in persuasion mode in late October, when that bit is really supposed to be over. Sure, Democratic Party hijinks made it so that her runway was historically short, but even then, she didn’t really start campaigning until two weeks ago. Now she’s in a panic.

Trump is in base-turnout mode. His focus isn’t convincing new people — it’s getting those people he’s convinced to turn up and vote.

It’s not just her desperate pandering to black men, detailed expertly in the next part of this letter by Blaze politics reporter Rebeka Zeljko. It’s also her outreach to independents and disenfranchised Republicans on Fox News and her attempts to reach Joe Rogan’s mostly male audience.

In a normal campaign with a normal nominee, these moves might signal confidence and a candidate willing to brave the limits to bring in more voters. That’s what you saw when former President Donald Trump took the stage with New York City’s elite at the Catholic Al Smith charity dinner, as he did Thursday night, looking relaxed and beaming confidence. That’s what you saw when he spent Sunday serving up fries at a McDonald’s northeast of Philadelphia, in a move that threatens to change presidential campaigning forever. That’s what you saw when he entered a chanting stadium later that day for the Steelers-Jets game. As we’ve covered pretty extensively in the newsletter, this is not the impetus behind Kamala’s new strategy.

Strategists have even convinced former first lady Michelle Obama, who is notoriously not a fan of Harris, Biden, or really anyone other than herself (and sometimes her husband), to come off the sidelines and campaign with Barack and the vice president. That’s star power, but maybe not persuasion. For all his prestige, former President Obama is a uniquely ineffective surrogate: His charisma doesn’t seem to extend anywhere beyond himself.

Trump is in a very different frame of mind: He’s in base-turnout mode. His focus isn’t convincing new people — it’s getting those people he’s convinced to turn up and vote. He’s campaigning in Latrobe and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or Concord and Greenville, North Carolina, where he did well in 2020 but needs people to turn out in even higher numbers.

It’s where you want to be in the final stretches. It’s especially important when your voters might be feeling optimistic enough to skip the polls on Election Day if something inconvenient comes up.

Down-ballot Democrats are worried, too. Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey released an ad touting his support for Trump’s past trade legislation and his willingness to stand against a President Harris when necessary. Pennsylvania is a must-win state for either party and has been neck and neck for weeks.

Over in Wisconsin, Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin has an ad touting her work with Presidents Trump and Joe Biden — never even mentioning the current Democrat nominee. Public polling shows Trump with a thin lead in the Badger State, but as with Pennsylvania, those expensive and often more reliable private polls must be showing something uglier. Baldwin has certainly changed her tune from bashing Trump and his supporters as “offensive, hateful, [and] unacceptable” to openly courting them.

Trump is looking relaxed. Harris: desperate. Vulnerable Democrats: panicked. A billion dollars in spending can make a big difference, but right now all the money in the world hasn’t put Harris’ campaign where it needs to be on this final stretch.

Harris-Walz campaign pulls out all the stops to woo black men

By Blaze News’ new politics reporter, Rebeka Zeljko

Black men are turning their backs on Vice President Kamala Harris and turning out record levels of support for former President Donald Trump.

Among black male voters, 20% said they would vote for Trump even though just 4% considered themselves Republican, according to a New York Times/Siena poll from Oct. 12. Trump is on track to perform better among young black men than any other Republican candidate since 1960, according to CNN pollster Harry Enten.

Harris has managed to hold on to only 41% of support from black men ages 18-44, which is a 12-point deficit from President Joe Biden’s numbers and roughly half of former President Barack Obama's support among the demographic, Enten’s analysis found.

These figures have sounded the alarm for the Harris campaign. In an attempt to regain their support, the Democratic presidential hopeful curated a policy pitch to the “brothas,” as Obama said.

Obama lectured other black men during a campaign appearance last week meant to boost turnout for Harris.

“We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,” Obama said to a roomful of black men. “Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothas. So if you don’t mind, I’m just going to speak to y’all directly.”

“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses; I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama continued. “Because part of it makes me think, and I’m speaking to men directly, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”

Harris has made other attempts to bridge the widening gap between herself and black men.

Harris unveiled her “opportunity agenda” for black men on Monday, featuring policy proposals like forgivable loans for “black entrepreneurs,” bolstering cryptocurrency so black men “know their money is safe,” and legalizing recreational marijuana, despite overseeing over 1,900 marijuana convictions during her tenure as San Francisco district attorney.

However, the campaign’s last-ditch effort to regain the votes fails to address the actual policy priorities of black men.

As in other demographics, the economy remains the top issue for roughly a quarter of black men, according to the recent NYT/Siena poll. While Harris’ pitch to black men is tailored to address issues with a racial backdrop, only 4% said equality is their top priority and just 2% said the same for racial issues.

Democratic political pundits like former CNN host Don Lemon are even admitting that “Kamala Harris has a problem with black men.”

“There’s a problem,” Lemon said. “I went from battleground state to battleground state. ... It was not curated. I went up to people just doing man on the street and said, ‘Who are you gonna vote for?’ Black men, time after time after time, they said, ‘I’m voting for Donald Trump.’”

Hear more on the subject from the "Blaze News Tonight" team in the video below:
Former President Donald Trump would do a better job of defending democracy than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Washington Post/Schar School poll of key swing states found.

The poll undercuts Harris’s closing argument that Trump is a threat to democracy because he is allegedly unhinged, unstable, and unchecked.

WATCH — Biden: Trump “Really Does Not Believe in Democracy”:

When the pollster asked voters in seven swing states whether Trump or Harris “would do a better job” of “defending against threats to democracy,” a plurality of voters chose Trump:

Trump: 43 percent

Harris: 40 percent

Trump was also the preferred candidate on the issues of inflation (16 points), the economy (15 points), immigration (15 points), and crime (10 points).

Harris led on the issues of health care and abortion, two issues that are of less importance to voters, according to polling.

The WaPo poll sampled 5,016 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from September 30 to October 15 with a 1.7 percentage point margin of error.

Polling shows Harris lost momentum in the past weeks while using the “campaign of joy.” Her new strategy appears to be the use of President Joe Biden’s 2020 and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 playbook that demonizes Trump.

Politico Playbook reported the shift on Friday:

You can see the change on the campaign trail, where Harris’ early emphasis on joy has given way to more direct verbal attacks on Trump, including playing video of him, AP’s Zeke Miller and Steve Karnowski report from La Crosse. You can see it on the airwaves, where a new Harris ad calls Trump “unhinged,” “unstable” and “unchecked” in a second term, NBC’s Monica Alba scooped. (Interestingly, this is all a bit of a return to Biden’s old anti-Trump messaging.) Reuters’ Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose report that the broader Harris strategy shift is an effort to play up her prosecutorial image and project strength to gain support from men and Republicans.

The reused attacks on Trump, however, do not present voters with a unifying message that candidates often transition to in the final weeks of presidential campaigns, underscoring the Harris campaign’s desperation.

“When Donald Trump repeatedly lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, or just insults people … people make excuses for it. They say, ‘He’s not serious.’ Everything a president says is serious,” former President Barack Obama attacked Trump.

“One of the most disturbing things about this election, about Trump’s rise in politics — we seem to have set aside the values that so many of us were taught,” he added.

Former President Donald Trump slammed “dumb as a rock” and “War Hawk” Liz Cheney for campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

Harris, who is struggling with Arab voters, invited Cheney to campaign with her on Monday in three Great Lakes swing states. The two are holding “moderated conversations” in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

Harris “wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind,” Trump posted on Truth Social:

Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris, the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States and a Low IQ individual, is campaigning with “dumb as a rock” War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind. “If Kamala gets four more years, the Middle East will spend the next four decades going up in flames, and your kids will be going off to War, maybe even a Third World War, something that will never happen with President Donald J. Trump in charge,” Trump added. For our Country’s sake, and for your kids, Vote Trump for PEACE!”

Washington Post/Schar School poll of key swing states During Harris’s event with Cheney, the former congresswoman attacked Trump for allegedly being anti-democracy, a closing Harris campaign messaging theme. On Monday, a/Schar School poll of key swing states undercut the campaign’s argument. Trump would do a better job of defending democracy than Harris, the poll found.

“I spent time working overseas before I was elected to Congress, and I have spent time working in countries where people aren’t free and where people are struggling for their freedom,” Cheney told supporters. “And I know how quickly democracies can unravel. … That is what’s on the ballot.”

“I thought to myself, you know, in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, are they going to grow up in a country where we don’t have to worry about the peaceful transfer of power? Are they going to grow up in a country where that is guaranteed?” Cheney continued. “And I believe that every one of us in this election has a duty and obligation to do what we know is right for the country, and that’s to support Vice President Harris.”

Harris trashed her own record as President Joe Biden’s vice president. “And needless to say,” Harris said, “mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration.”

Harris continued:

I bring to it my own ideas, my own experiences, but it is also about moving past what, frankly, I think, has been the last decade of the American discourse being influenced by Donald Trump, in a way that has had the effect of suggesting we as Americans should point the finger at one another in a way that has been using the power of the presidency to demean and divide us.
Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris by double digits in Florida — once a considered a battleground state — according to a University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) survey released Monday.

The survey, taken among 977 likely Florida voters, showed 53 percent expressing support of Trump this election cycle. Harris came in ten points behind, garnering just 43 percent support. Two percent said they would vote for another candidate, and two percent remain unsure.

WATCH — CNN’s Jennings: Harris Struggling Because Dems Focus on “Dudes Who Want to Become Women”:

The survey noted they included “blurters” in the final results:

After the initial president and senate vote choice questions, undecided respondents were then asked in a follow-up question who they lean toward if they had to choose between the candidates. In addition, responses were recorded from those who refused to take the survey, but volunteered who they would vote for before hanging up the phone. These “leaners” and “blurters” are included in the point estimates for president and senate vote choices

Poll director Michael Binder put it this way:

Prior research tells us that the folks who blurt out their candidate vote choice and then hang up are very likely to vote, and most of those ‘blurters’ are Trump supporters. This might help explain why his lead widened to 10 points, up from 7 in our last poll back in July.

Not only does Trump have a ten-point lead, but he is leading among key demographics. Perhaps surprisingly, Trump is edging out Harris among women, garnering 49 percent support to Harris’s 48 percent support. Further, Trump has a double-digit lead among Hispanic voters in Florida, as 55 percent said they are supporting the former president, compared to 41 percent who are going for Harris.

They survey also examined the Senate race and found incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) leading Democrat Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL) by three points — 49 percent to 46 percent support.

The survey was taken October 7-18 among 977 likely voters in Florida. It has a +/- 3.49 percent margin of error.

The results coincide with the stark reality that the Sunshine State now has over one-million more registered Republican voters than Democrats after initially overtaking them for the first time in November 2021.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) issued a seemingly triggered response to former President Donald Trump working at a Philadelphia McDonald’s on Sunday.

Walz, the vice presidential running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, responded to a video of Trump wearing an apron at McDonald’s and learning how to make french fries. In his post on X, Walz referenced Harris’s unproven claim that she had previously worked at a McDonald’s.

“This guy spent decades stiffing workers pay, cut overtime benefits for millions of people, and opposed any effort to raise the minimum wage,” Walz wrote in his post.

“You know who has actually worked at McDonald’s, joined workers on picket lines, and fights for working people?” Walz added, “@KamalaHarris.”

Walz’s social media post criticizing Trump’s visit to McDonald’s where he learned to make french fries, served customers their orders, and spoke with several customers in the drive-through.

One customer told Trump that he and his wife were praying for him

“Thank you, Mr. President,” the customer said from the drive-through window. “You made it possible for ordinary people like us to meet you. Thank you so much for everything you are doing. We pray for you, and you are the type of person we want to be the president.”

The customer’s wife added: “Thank you for taking the bullet for us.”

“Mr. President, please don’t let the United States become Brazil, my native Brazil,” another customer told Trump.

“We’re going to make it better than ever,” Trump responded.

Trump’s visit to the McDonald’s comes as Harris has previously alleged that she used to work at a McDonald’s.

During an interview with Drew Barrymore, Harris was asked if “rumors” that Harris had worked at a McDonald’s were true.

“I did,” Harris said. “Yes, I did work at McDonald’s. When I was at school … I did fries. I did fries. I did fries, and then I did the cashier.”

Harris has also previously claimed during a labor rally in 2019 while running for president in the 2020 presidential election that she used to work at McDonald’s.

“I worked in McDonald’s,” Harris said at the time. “I was a student when I was working in McDonald’s.”

Harris’s claims that she used to work at a McDonald’s come as she has previously “never mentioned it” while campaigning or even put it in her “two books,” the Washington Free Beacon reported in August, adding that McDonald’s was also not listed on her previous job applications or resumes:

Harris’s work at McDonald’s, which allegedly took place at a franchise in the California Bay Area the summer after her freshman year in college, is a recent addition to her carefully curated life story. For decades, Harris never mentioned it, not on the campaign trail nor in two books. It’s absent from a job application and resume she submitted a year after she graduated from college. Third-party biographers did not write about it. Not until Harris ran for president in 2019 and spoke to a labor rally in Las Vegas did she mention the jobb, telling the crowd that she “was a student when I was working in a McDonald’s.”

A campaign ad for Harris from August also references the McDonald’s claim: “She grew up in a middle-class home. She was the daughter of a working mom, and she worked at McDonald’s while she got her degree. Kamala Harris knows what it’s like to be middle-class, it’s why she’s determined to lower healthcare costs and make housing more affordable.”

The Washington Free Beacon adds that while “it is possible that Harris” actually worked at McDonald’s when she was younger, the “absence of that detail in public records and her campaign’s coyness and refusal to provide any further details raise questions”:

Politicians who worked menial food service jobs as teens are often quick to mention it as proof of their working class bon fides. Future president Barack Obama, during his 2008 campaign, said his first job scooping ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins in Honolulu instilled in himm the virtues of responsibility and hard work.

Trump’s visit to McDonald’s was also criticized by MSNBC host Alex Witt, and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), who noted that “there’s no logic to it.”
Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign will be remembered for a lot of things: fake accents, Gov. Tim Walz’s dance moves and a claim about working at a McDonald’s that is so confusing people will be scratching their heads for decades.

It is honestly impressive that we’ll remember anything from this campaign at all given her campaign’s unprecedented lack of substance, transparency and engagement with the American public. Driven by her low favorables, and the fact that she has been unable to garner a single vote in 6 years now, Kamala HQ is running a campaign reminiscent of Biden’s “basement strategy” but on steroids.

Harris and her running mate, the self-proclaimed “Knucklehead” Tim Walz, have offered nothing but vague rhetoric and “vibes” to the American people. And although she is auditioning for the toughest job in America, Harris has fully embraced the basement strategy, consistently dodging tough questions and interviews.

The numbers tell the story. Since August, former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, as reported by Fox News, have participated in 88 interviews while Harris and Walz have only done 49 combined. Sure, the campaign trots her out occasionally to read a scripted teleprompter or do a prerecorded friendly interview, but when you compare the records, it is no question that Trump-Vance has no problem defending their vision for America and their policies while Harris-Walz actively avoids tough questions.

In lieu of presenting and defending her policies, the Harris-Walz campaign has decided to double down on the wait-and-see approach — a facet of the basement strategy, where she expects voters will be content waiting and seeing how radical her administration will be if she is elected.

The Harris-Walz reluctance to take tough questions raises serious concerns about her ability to lead the nation. At a time when the country needs concrete solutions, Harris’s reluctance to engage with the media, participate in interviews, or hold press conferences sends a strong signal: not only does she not have fixes for the problems her administration is responsible for — but she thinks so little of the American public that she expects people to promote her anyway.

Harris can talk about a “New Way Forward” and “Turning the Page,” but when asked during a rare appearance in her safe space on The View, she confirmed Americans fears about her candidacy when she said she would not have done a single thing differently than President Joe Biden in the past four years.

A truly bizarre thing to say when over half of America believes the country is headed in the wrong direction under the Biden-Harris administration.

Sensing the campaign’s dire situation, Harris agreed to appear on Fox News for the first time since launching her campaign. While she didn’t avoid the interview itself, she dodged questions, shifting the blame for every crisis that her administration created to none other than Donald Trump.

Instead of talking about the issues families care about, like rising prices and securing the border, she deflects to what this race has always been about for the Democratic Party, Trump vs. the radical Left — no policies, but personalities.

You would think the person who wants to be elected to the highest office in the country would want to answer questions from American voters and tell people what they stand for. But not Harris.

Nearly every recent poll has revealed Harris’ Biden basement campaign is not working. Her honeymoon high after the Democrat machine pulled the rug from Biden has faded. Now, battleground state polls are leaning towards a Trump victory—especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump has also dismantled the Democrat coalition, receiving significant support from union workers, Latinos and Black Americans — sending a clear message to the DNC that the momentum and energy are with Trump.

Put simply, the Harris-Walz campaign is crumbling before our eyes because Americans are smart. They see through the Left’s basement strategy, and a campaign that is running solely on pandering and hollow promises.

Meanwhile, Trump is offering the American people policy proposals to return to economic prosperity, a secure border, safe communities, and global stability.

One of the most pivotal battleground states in the 2024 election has now seen more than 1.4 million residents cast their ballots early.

Georgia has been shattering turnout records since early voting began on Tuesday.

As of Monday morning, the Georgia state elections website showed 1,347,843 ballots were cast in person so far, while just over 80,000 absentee ballots have been returned and accepted.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

"Today there is Sunday voting in several counties. And AGAIN the voters have set another record," Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer in the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, wrote on X yesterday.

"As of 2:30 over 25,000 Georgians had cast ballots today. The previous Sunday record was 24k back in 2022. Keep up the great work counties and voters."

The Sunday total wound up being just over 42,400 votes cast – nearly double the 2022 tally.

On the first day of early voting alone, Georgians cast more than 313,000 in-person ballots. That was 123% higher than the previous Day 1 record, according to Sterling.

Total turnout so far accounts for nearly 20% of Georgia’s population of active voters. White voters made up the largest share of that total so far, followed by Black voters. Georgia women also slightly outnumbered men in the pre-Election Day tally by 55.4% to 45.4%.

Georgia has been a key focal point in the high-stakes White House battle between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Both sides have poured enormous amounts of time and resources into the state, which President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.

Meanwhile, Trump will participate in a religious event himself in rural Georgia this week, according to WRBL.

The former president will be in Pike County on Wednesday in support of congressional candidate Brian Jack, who worked in the first Trump administration.
MALVERN, Pa. – The most high-profile GOP politician who is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Trump in the presidential election says that there are plenty of fellow Republicans who will quietly support the Democratic nominee.

"They’re going to vote the right way on Nov. 5. They might not be public about it, but they’ll do what they know is right," former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming said on Monday, as she teamed up with Harris at a campaign event in suburban Philadelphia in battleground Pennsylvania.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make a consequential impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the key swing states.

As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in the closing stretch of the presidential campaign, Harris on Monday was teaming up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in two other crucial swing states – Michigan and Wisconsin.

HARRIS-TRUMP CASH DASH: NEW FILINGS SHOW WHICH CANDIDATE IS THE CLEAR FUNDRAISING FRONT-RUNNER

Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent the former president from returning to power.

"We have the opportunity to tell the whole world who we are, and we have the chance to say, you know, we're going to reject cruelty. We're going to reject the kind of vile vitriol that we've seen from Donald Trump. We're going to reject, the misogyny that we've seen from Donald Trump and JD Vance," Cheney argued.

CRUNCH TIME: HARRIS TO TEAM UP WITH THE OBAMAS IN THESE CRUCIAL SWING STATES

And she emphasized that "we have the chance in this race to elect somebody who… is going to defend the rule of law. You know, Vice President Harris is going to defend our Constitution."

Cheney said her endorsement of the vice president was "not at all a difficult choice" and she reached her decision in part as a mother. Harris is hoping Cheney’s support will help her win support from Republican women who may hesitate on backing their party's presidential nominee.

Cheney, the daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, once rose within the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies and was eventually ousted from her No. 3 House GOP leadership position .

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she lost the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to Harriet Hageman, a candidate backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would vote for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father also endorsed Harris.

And Cheney formally backed Harris as they teamed up on the campaign for the first time earlier this month, at an event in Ripon, Wisconsin.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign has repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election in which she said, "@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America."

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan earlier this month, charged that Cheney was "terrible" and "a stupid war hawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people."

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued, "I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them."

And ahead of Monday's event, Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley argued in a statement that "Liz Cheney is just as unpopular as Kamala Harris is to Pennsylvania voters – bringing her to the Keystone State to try to catch up to President Trump's lead is not a winning strategy."

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

Cheney and her father are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Kinzinger and Duncan joined other prominent Republicans who are backing the vice president at an event with Harris last week in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, at the historic park where George Washington crossed the Delaware River on Christmas night 1776 – a turning point moment in the American Revolutionary War.

The lifelong Pennsylvania Republicans who introduced Harris at last week's event – Bob and Kristina Lange – were part of a group sitting on stage behind Harris and Cheney at Monday's event.

The Langes, who own a family farm in Chester County, Pennsylvania, have also starred in a Harris campaign commercial. The Langes say they've seen a barrage of hateful and derogatory messages following their appearance in the Harris ad.

But in an interview last week, they noted that their Republican friends say "that they're on the same page that we are. They're approaching us and telling us ‘We’re behind you.' They're thanking us for what we're doing. They're thanking us for being brave because many people are afraid to speak out against Trump because of revenge and other things like that."

Harris, as she and Cheney took moderated questions from the audience at a theater in the outer suburbs of Philadelphia, reiterated that her administration "will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring to it my own ideas, my own experiences."

And while the town hall style event was aimed at speaking to suburban women, the vice president also made an appeal to younger voters, after answering a question from a college student.

"I love Gen Z," she highlighted.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement criticized a Massachusetts court for releasing an illegal immigrant accused of raping a child, putting scrutiny on the blue state's sanctuary policies and criticism from a member of former President George W. Bush's administration amid a wave of migrant crime concerns across the U.S.

Maynor Francisco Hernandez-Rodas, a 38-year-old Guatemalan national, was charged in June with aggravated rape of a child by force, but he was released after a local court "refused to honor" ICE's detainer request, the agency said in a release earlier this month.

ICE said that Middlesex County "ignored ERO Boston’s immigration detainer and released Hernandez" on an unknown date before ICE took him into custody on Sept. 20.

"Maynor Francisco Hernandez-Rodas stands accused of horrific crimes against a Massachusetts child," ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde said in a statement. "He represents a significant danger to the children of our community that we will not tolerate. ERO Boston will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing egregious noncitizen threats from our New England neighborhoods."

TOP BIDEN AGENCY ISSUES BLUNT MESSAGE TO CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS AFTER EXPLOSIVE DATA BECOMES LIABILITY FOR ADMIN

Alfonso Aguilar, the Director of Hispanic Engagement at the American Principles Project and the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship in the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News Digital that this incident highlights the state "putting ideology over what's best for their citizens."

"It happens a lot that the individual goes for release, and then they go ahead and re-offend – which is preventable," he said. "It's following a radical ideology."

"Some argue that to build trust with the community, it's better not to respect ICE detainers, but that's ridiculous," he said. "How do you build trust with the community when you're releasing to the community a violent criminal? It makes absolutely no sense."

Detainer disputes in Massachusetts

The Bay State's history of ICE detainers stems from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's 2017 rule under Lunn v. Commonwealth.

The rule stated that Massachusetts' courts don’t have the authority to "arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody."

NANTUCKET'S MIGRANT CRISIS HANDLING CALLED OUT AFTER QUIET ISLAND ROCKED BY WAVE OF VIOLENT ATTACKS

Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, who was the state's attorney general in 2017, praised the ruling in a statement at the time, saying that it was a "victory for the rule of law and smart immigration and criminal justice policies, and a rejection of anti-immigrant policies that have stoked fear in communities across the country."

Aguilar said that Healey's prior statement "disregards the rule of law" and "shields illegal immigrants" over community members.

TRUMP SOUNDS ALARM ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MURDERERS: ‘A LOT OF BAD GENES IN OUR COUNTRY’

"This guy committed a very heinous crime, and he was charged with committing a heinous crime, and he should be detained and removed," he said. "And this idea that courts should not cooperate with federal authorities is ridiculous."

"I don't see how this is a victory for the rule of law, but Massachusetts is known for having a very aggressive advocacy community with strong links with Democratic politicians," he said.

The immigration expert said that by promising to protect migrants in the state, officials have simultaneously committed to defending criminals.

By shielding to protect every single illegal immigrant, they made a commitment to also defend the most serious criminals. — Alfonso Aguilar, Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles

"By shielding to protect every single illegal immigrant, they made a commitment to also defend the most serious criminals," Aguilar said. "With the arrival of so many migrants in the past three years, serious crime – murder, violent crime, gun violence – has all gone up."

"So Massachusetts is basically telling their citizens, 'We're not going to protect you, you're on your own,'" he said. "That is scary."

The 2017 legal ruling turned Massachusetts into "a haven for criminal illegal immigrants who know they can be arrested, released, and evade deportation," Massachusetts Republican Party Chair Amy Carnevale told Fox News Digital. "If someone is in the country illegally — whether they crossed the border unlawfully or skipped a court date — it defies logic to expect that person to return for trial after being released.

"In what other country can an illegal immigrant, charged with aggravated rape of a child, be arraigned and then set free on bail, without working with immigration authorities? This ruling puts the safety of citizens at risk and every day that passes without the legislature taking action, our communities are further threatened. The legislature must act now to protect our communities by requiring courts to honor ICE detainers. This is not about partisanship — it’s about safeguarding our neighborhoods and doing what’s right for the people of Massachusetts."

Immigration and the 2024 election

Immigration has been a top issue during the election season, with former President Trump promising "the largest domestic deportation operation in American history" if elected.

"We had the most secure border in U.S. history. Now, we have the worst border in the history of the world," Trump said during a campaign rally stop in Iowa in September 2023. "Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history."

Vice President Kamala Harris has acknowledged that the U.S. has a broken immigration system and placed her support behind border security and a legal pathway to citizenship.

"We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border," Harris said during the Democratic National Convention in August. "I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that [Trump] killed, and I will sign it into law."

TRUMP SAYS HE WILL CARRY OUT ‘LARGEST DOMESTIC DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY’ IF ELECTED

Aguilar said that for the federal government to require states like Massachusetts to enforce ICE detainers would require them to "clarify that federal immigration is a federal issue."

"If federal immigration is a federal issue, then law and state law enforcement should comply with federal detainers of illegal immigrants," he said. "And I think that's how the federal government and a new Trump administration should respond. Detainers are going to be key, so you want to make sure that local law enforcement agencies collaborate."

Fox News Digital has reached out to ICE and Gov. Healey's office for comment.
Former President Donald Trump is now leading Vice President Kamala Harris for the first time in an election forecast, a poll released Sunday shows.

The news was contained in a Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast for this cycle.

The model predicts Trump has a 52 percent chance of reclaiming the presidency while Harris has a 42 percent chance of entering the White House, as of Sunday. A report in the Hill sets out the change in prospects for the two protagonists:

Since late August, the election forecast put Harris’s chances of winning at approximately 54 to 56 percent, with Trump’s chances at approximately 44 to 46 percent. In early October, however, those dynamics began to shift, and the election forecast predicted both candidates’ chances to be closer to 50 percent. On Oct. 17, the model predicted the two candidates were equally likely to win next month, and Trump took the advantage on Oct. 20.

The report goes on to note the shift in election forecast “coincides with the Republican candidate’s improved polling averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, two battleground states that previously leaned slightly toward Harris. Trump already had a slim advantage in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.”

Of the seven swing states seen as decisive in determining the outcome of the 2024 election, Pennsylvania is alone in still favoring Harris in its polling average, the hill concludes.

Despite the closeness of the contest Harris will reportedly not be campaigning with her soon-to-be former boss going into Election Day.

As Breitbart News reported, three Harris campaign officials confirmed to NBC News the Harris campaign has no plans for Biden to appear alongside his vice president on the campaign trail.

The officials said Biden will instead be working behind the scenes to leverage some of his “longtime political relationships, specifically with labor leaders, and holding official White House events that highlight his administration’s record.”
With just 15 days before Election Day, the media and Democrats are trying to paint Donald Trump as a candidate mentally unfit for the White House.

Despite covering up President Joe Biden's obvious mental decline for years, Democrats and the media are now trying to make a story out of Trump's mental fitness, claiming he, too, is experiencing a level of cognitive decline that disqualifies him from the presidency.

'The 2024 Trump seems more confident and is certainly more knowledgeable about policy than he was in 2015.'

The evidence of mental decline, Trump's critics claim, revolves around his speeches. At his campaign rallies, Trump often speaks off the cuff for long periods of time, which his critics see as incoherent rambling and proof of mental decline.

Here are some recent headlines:

But the editorial board at the Wall Street Journal says, in their firsthand experience, that is not true.

In fact, not only does the Journal's editorial board not believe that Trump is experiencing the cognitive decline that Democrats and the media claim is happening, but they observed that Trump is sharper today than he was nearly a decade ago.

The editors of the Journal reported their observation with confidence last Friday, one day after Trump met with them.

From the WSJ editorial board:

Lately Mr. Trump’s detractors have been speculating about his 'mental decline.' There’s no sign of such slippage in our Thursday meeting. The 2024 Trump seems more confident and is certainly more knowledgeable about policy than he was in 2015. His discursive style of talking can confuse listeners, but that was equally true nine years ago, and he never appears lost in his thoughts the way President Biden repeatedly did in their June debate.

Not only do the editors at WSJ see no evidence of Trump's purported mental decline, but people who spend time with him deny it, too.

It's rich, after all, for the institutions and people who for years ignored Biden's mental decline now to suddenly demonstrate concern about a candidate's mental fitness. The American people see through the charade.

Far-left Politico, a blog dedicated to disinformation and lies, is no longer hiding its desire to see former President Donald Trump assassinated.

Over the weekend, Politico published a piece of assassination porn warning the public of a “very real scenario where Trump loses and takes power anyway.” I don’t link to anything meant to encourage violence, but that’s the headline and it includes a photo of a burnt-out map of red and blue America.

There is no reason to waste everyone’s time running down the scenario Politico’s assassination porn peddlers lay out. Suffice it to say, that Trump was already president, Trump has already lost an election he believes he won, and if he did none of this while he wielded the power of the presidency, why would and how could he do it as a private citizen?

But Politico and its confederates in the corporate media are not about logic or enlightenment. This five-thousand-word article (yes, five thousand) isn’t about reporting, explaining, or predicting a possible outcome to the 2024 election. It is only about one thing: justifying and encouraging the assassination of former President Trump.

Already this summer, Trump has been shot in the head and then came incomprehensibly close to being gunned down on a golf course.

And of course, this violence is the result of a decade-long left-wing hate campaign against this man, most of it backed by billions and billions of corporate dollars and produced by hate outlets like CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, New York Times, and Politico.

If Hitler’s Nazis taught us anything it’s that if you dehumanize someone (which is precisely what has happened to Trump), you authorize their death. When you relentlessly and over an extended period of time lie about someone being the next Hitler, a unique threat to democracy, a rapist, a Russian spy, and a racist, there is no question that you are deliberately desensitizing violence and murder against this person, be it one man or an entire race of people.

Politico fears it cannot beat Trump at the ballot box, so it publishes a 5,000-word article that falsely paints Trump as an anti-democratic tyrant who will somehow seize power even if he loses two weeks from now.

It is 5,000 words of pure bullshit, of total nonsense, and Politico knows this. But in Politico’s eyes, if all this effort and work can encourage one unstable person desperate for fame to take a shot at Trump, it’s worth it.

The not-subtle subtext of the Politico piece is a message that says, Dear Patriots: If you want to be remembered as an America hero who saved democracy, you will do everything in your power to stop this man. Yes, you might be killed or imprisoned, but you will be remembered for all history as a martyr for freedom.

After two assassination attempts, no decent news outlet publishes incendiary lies like this unless it is looking for a third attempt.

Politico is no longer hiding its desire to see Donald Trump murdered.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis planned her prosecution of former President Donald Trump before she took office, her former top prosecutor Nathan Wade revealed in a bombshell deposition before the House Judiciary Committee.

Willis’s prosecution of Trump for election interference has hit numerous roadblocks inside and outside the courtroom. Trump, who pleaded not guilty, has argued her case is politically motivated lawfare.

WATCH — Ex-Con on Lawfare Against Trump: If They Will Do That to a President, What Chance Do We Have?:

Wade’s deposition on October 15 before Chairman Jim Jordan’s (R-OH) committee revealed Willis planned her legal assault on Trump before she took office in January 2021.

Wade, after struggling to remember the timeline, acknowledged Willis contacted him “sometime after the election, but prior to her taking office” to recruit him to lead a search committee for a special prosecutor to target Trump. The committee eventually selected Wade.

“Eventually, I guess the committee turned their guns on me and started trying to convince me to accept the role,” Wade said.

The day after Wade signed his lucrative contract with Willis, he filed for divorce from his wife. Willis and Wade later testified in court that after they began their affair — and after Wade began receiving checks from her office — he took her on multiple exotic vacations.

Wade officially resigned from the case in March 2024 after Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled that Willis could only remain on the Trump case — his sole assignment — if she removed Wade or if he voluntarily resigned.

While McAfee’s ruling found that the former lovers’ relationship produced no “actual conflict,” he wrote that the two engaged in an “appearance of impropriety” necessitating Wade’s removal.

Beyond suggesting a political motivation behind Willis’s Trump prosecution, Wade’s deposition included multiple other troubling moments regarding the level of White House involvement that led to more questions than answers.

Wade confirmed multiple meetings with Biden-Harris White House officials but repeatedly refused to disclose details of those meetings. He repeatedly claimed he did not remember whether critical meetings — some of which lasted 8 hours, according to his billings — occurred in person or via teleconference.

2024-10-15 Nathan Wade Deposition_Redacted_Errata by jmanship on Scribd

The most critical meeting took place on November 18, 2022, when Wade spent eight hours in the White House counsel’s office. That meeting occurred the same day U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith and Matthew Colangelo, the former third-highest ranking official at the U.S. Department of Justice, resigned to take a position in the Manhattan prosecutor’s office.

That trio of events occurred just days a November 9 press conference in which President Joe Biden, asked about the prospects of Trump running against him in 2024, said, “We just have to demonstrate that he will not take power, if he does run, making sure he, under legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next president again [sic].”

Breitbart News first reported the significance of those November 18 meetings, occurring on the heels of Biden’s pronouncement.

Despite the significance of meeting with White House counsel — a privilege rarely offered to a lowly county prosecutor — Wade testified that he did not remember this meeting or whether it occurred by telephone or in person.

He had billed the meeting as “Interview with DC/White House” and was paid 8 hours of work at $250 per hour.

Wade’s inability to remember details of critical meetings on his lone assignment for the office is striking. In another example, Wade confirmed billing Willis’s office $2,000 on May 23, 2022, for “Travel to Athens; Conf with White House Counsel.” Yet he could not recall who was involved with the meeting, where the meeting occurred, or whether the meeting occurred over the phone or in person.

He said, “I can’t recall,” “I don’t recall,” or “I don’t know” 58 times during his deposition.

Wade also confirmed his office’s coordination with Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) much-maligned January 6th Committee, which Republicans have argued was illegally constituted and a political sham.

He confirmed meeting with “individuals associated with the January 6th Committee,” on several dates in 2022, although he repeatedly was unable to remember key details. After acknowledging he met with “lawyers” connected to the committee, he could not recall who the lawyers represented and did not provide their names.

Although McAfee ruled no actual conflict took place in Willis’s appointment of Wade, Republicans and legal experts have criticized Wade’s fitness for the role. His prior experience includes working in private practice as a trial attorney on contract disputes and family law and as a municipal judge dealing with traffic tickets.

Wade admitted in his deposition he had no relevant experience for the role and had to seek remedial training to gain applicable subject matter knowledge.

Despite Wade being an apparently poor fit to oversee such a prosecution, he admitted during his deposition that no one oversaw his work as special prosecutor.

Willis instructed Wade on the day before his deposition not to answer any questions about his work in her office to the House Judiciary Committee, Breitbart news reported.

In addition to Wade’s repeated inability to remember details regarding Willis’s office and his work prosecuting Trump, Wade’s counsel repeatedly interjected to channel Willis’s instructions that the case was “ongoing,” hindering the committee from details on the case.

Nearly two weeks after 60 Minutes was caught rigging an interview to make Kamala Harris sound coherent, the disgraced outlet released a statement admitting it edited her answer.

In a promotional clip released by CBS News to promote the Harris interview, this was the sitting vice president’s disastrous answer to a question from 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker about her administration’s inability to influence Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.

After that clip earned wide ridicule, when the interview was broadcast on 60 Minutes, CBS News replaced the word salad. Viewers watched Kamala give a very different answer to the exact same question:

We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.

She sounds more coherent there, no question, but it is only in the first quote that she actually answers the question. The second quote comes off as more decisive, but it’s not an answer. No credible news agency would make that choice.

The uproar was instantaneous, including from the Trump campaign, who called for CBS to release an unedited transcript of the interview. An FCC complaint has since been filed (accurately) accusing CBS News of manipulating the news. Under pressure to respond, CBS finally admitted to replacing Kamala’s answer but laughably claimed there was nothing wrong with that editorial decision:

60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.

So there’s an admission, only it’s couched in the hubristic bullshit of journalistic ethics.

The unrung bell in that statement remains CBS’s refusal to release an unedited transcript. Obviously, 60 Minutes wants Kamala Harris to win the election. Obviously, 60 Minutes is hoping to run out the clock to Election Day.

This is the third presidential election CBS and 60 Minutes have tried to rig.

In 2004, CBS and 60 Minutes allowed Dan Rather to report on forged documents that “proved” then-Republican President George W. Bush had gone AWOL during his time with the Texas Air National Guard.

In 2020, CBS and 60 Minutes lied about Hunter Biden’s laptop being a product of Russian disinformation during an interview with then-President Trump. CBS News has still not retracted that lie, which is why Trump wisely refused to sit down with these election riggers this year.

And now, here they go again, rigging 2024 to aid and abet Kamala Harris.

Democrats sure got it good.

John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.
Since the 2020 election and its climax on Jan. 6, 2021, the Democratic Party, its activists and its media apparatchiks have portrayed Republican-led election integrity efforts as a sinister plot to disenfranchise black voters and rebuild Jim Crow South.

The unhinged rhetoric had its origins in the battleground state of Georgia, where, in March 2021, the state passed a law that placed restrictions on absentee ballots and enhanced the verification process for said ballots, requiring a photo ID, driver’s license or state ID number or the last four digits of one’s Social Security number instead of a signature match. President Joe Biden attacked the new rules, which he described as “Jim Crow in the 21st Century,” and accused Georgia Republicans of voter suppression. In the aftermath, the Biden Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a lawsuit against the state, while Major League Baseball (MLB) boycotted its own All-Star Game in Atlanta. (RELATED: Georgia’s New Voting Law — Myths And Facts)

Biden and the Democratic Party only escalated their rhetoric nearly a year later, with Biden doubling down on the “Jim Crow” propaganda.

“Their endgame? To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion — something states can respect or ignore,” Biden said in Atlanta, Georgia, in January 2022. “Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all. It’s not hyperbole; this is a fact.”

Despite the hysteria, Georgia saw a record turnout for the 2022 Midterm Elections. Now in the 2024 Election, the battleground state, which broke for Biden and delivered the Senate to Democrats in 2020, is shattering its previous record, with over 1.4 million voters casting a ballot in just one week of early voting.

Other Republican-controlled swing states, such as Texas and North Carolina, have also taken steps to ensure election integrity. Texas passed its own election security bill in 2021 after Georgia’s in March of that year. In September 2024, officials announced that the North Carolina State Board of Elections had removed 747,000 names from the state’s voter rolls within the past 20 months for reasons including death, felony convictions or a failure to register new addresses after moving to a different county.

Like Georgia, North Carolina saw a new record in early voting this election, with more than 350,000 ballots casted Oct. 17. Another 150,000 ballots were casted by afternoon of Oct. 18, even though the Western half of the state is still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Helene, according to The Washington Post.

Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an election integrity executive order in August that requires the state’s Office of Motor Vehicles to share names of foreign nationals and non-permanent residents with the Secretary of State’s office. State agencies must include a notice that U.S. citizenship is required to vote when distributing voter registration materials, according to the order. None of these rules come close to the level of disenfranchisement seen throughout the actual Jim Crow South, before Civil Rights legislation in the 60s. And of course, Louisiana has already set a new record for early voting, with 176,882 ballots cast Oct. 18., a 1.3% increase from the first day of early voting in 2020.

Early voting in Texas starts Monday, and if Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina are any indicators, the Lone Star state will also see a record or two broken. The pace of 2024’s early voting might also point to a record-breaking voter turnout across all states.

Whether more Americans turn out to vote in 2024 than 2020, these early numbers should finally put to bed the left’s fear-mongering that Republicans are instituting a new wave of Jim Crow. Although it’s difficult to say whether Democrats believe their conspiracies, their rhetoric is nonetheless a potent, if poisonous, political attack that does more harm than good to U.S. elections. It is also an insult to the black Americans who lived through actual Jim Crow and to the Civil Rights activists who worked to overturn racist laws, not laws that simply require so much as photo ID to vote.
Sunday brought a stark split screen to the 2024 presidential race – Vice President Kamala Harris marking her 60th with Stevie Wonder singing "Happy Birthday" in Georgia, while former President Trump worked the drive-thru at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania.

Celebrities have been flocking to support Harris’ 2024 campaign since she entered the race over the summer, and battleground states are seeing their fair share of A-lister visits as early voting kicks off.

Among the places where star power has been most pronounced is Georgia, which has seen a litany of famous faces.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

It comes as both campaigns work to generate support in the state that President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.

The winner will likely need a significant amount of support from the state’s Black population and middle-class suburban voters outside of Atlanta.

For his part to win over working voters, Trump cooked and served french fries to customers at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania on Sunday, while accusing Harris of lying about once working at the fast-food restaurant.

"I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala at McDonald's," Trump said through the drive-thru window as he handed out orders.

Meanwhile, part of Harris’ strategy to win over voters appears to be reaching out to Hollywood celebrities. Before Wonder’s appearance on Sunday, Georgia also saw rally appearances by Grammy-winning artists Meghan Thee Stallion and Usher.

In September, music icon John Legend appeared at a fireside chat event aimed at engaging young Georgia voters, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.

Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts also returned to her hometown of Smyrna, Georgia, to campaign for Harris.

TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE

Musical artist MAJOR, stars of Bravo’s "Married To Medicine," "Orange Is The New Black" actress Uzo Aduba, and "The Walking Dead" actress Danai Gurira have all traveled to Georgia to help Harris.

Georgia is not the only state where Harris received celebrity support – band Bon Iver performed for her campaign in Wisconsin, singer Lizzo appeared in Detroit and actress Jennifer Garner is holding events in Arizona.

But the concentrated flow of celebrities to Georgia reflects the state’s critical status in the election.

The Peach State has also already shattered previous voter turnout records, with more than 1.4 million early and absentee ballots recorded so far.

TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE

Celebrity support is not a new phenomenon in presidential races by any stretch, but it’s worth noting Harris has seen much more high-profile public support from Hollywood than Trump.

Trump’s campaign won endorsements from NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, who appeared with Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, in North Carolina; actor Dennis Quaid, who spoke in support of Trump in California; Grammy winner Kanye "Ye" West, and country singer Jason Aldean, among others.

Harris’ endorsers also include Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.
FIRST ON FOX: Republican businessman Eric Hovde is using Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin's previous comments on Trump supporters against her as he looks to unseat her in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.

In a new ad by the Hovde campaign, Baldwin says, "Donald Trump might be one of the most offensive, hateful and unacceptable presidential candidates we've ever had. So what does that say about the people who support him?"

The remark, which is from a 2016 speech, is cut next to former Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's infamous "basket of deplorables" comment, which was credited by some with costing her the election to then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.

SENATE SHAKE-UP: HOW A SECRET BALLOT COULD UNDERMINE A POTENTIAL TRUMP ENDORSEMENT IN RACE TO THE TOP

The ad will run on television across Wisconsin starting Tuesday and is part of an ongoing multimillion dollar statewide ad campaign.

"Tammy Baldwin hates Trump and Trump voters, just listen to her own words when it comes to what she thinks about them. Much like Hillary Clinton, the disdain Baldwin has for Wisconsin’s Trump voters will haunt her on Election Day," Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said in a statement.

HOVDE SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TAMMY BALDWIN'S WALL STREET PARTNER DURING WISCONSIN DEBATE

In response, a Baldwin spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, "Tammy Baldwin fights for all Wisconsinites no matter who they are, who they vote for or where they live. That stands in stark contrast to her opponent Eric Hovde who has literally called Wisconsinites deplorable, Democrats a ‘curse to society’ and insulted our farmers, seniors, young people, women, Black men, Native American communities and more."

The Democrat senator's campaign also pointed to an interview on "The Jerry Bader Show" in 2016, in which Hovde used the word "deplorable" to describe the level of civic knowledge among average Americans, with many not knowing the year of the country's founding or who the vice president is.

In a recent Quinnipiac University poll of the Senate race, Baldwin beat Hovde 50% to 46%. The small, single-digit lead marks a significant closure of the initial polling gap between the incumbent Democrat and her GOP challenger.

The survey was conducted between Oct. 3 and 7 and included 1,073 likely voters. It had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

A top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, recently shifted its Wisconsin Senate rating from "Lean Democrat" to a "Toss Up."

With 15 days until Election Day in November, polls point to a margin-of-error race for the White House between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.

But in the dash for campaign cash – another key metric in presidential politics – there is one very clear frontrunner: Harris.

The vice president entered the final full month of the campaign with a massive financial advantage over the former president, according to new federal fundraising filings late Sunday.

The Harris campaign hauled in $221.8 million in September, according to the filings, more than triple the $63 million brought in by the Trump campaign last month.

CRUNCH TIME: HARRIS TEAMING UP WITH OBAMAS NEXT WEEK ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL

Roughly a quarter of the money raked in by the vice president came during celebrity-studded fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the end of last month.

Harris has vastly outraised and outspent Trump since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket three months ago, and that trend continued in September. The largest expense by the Harris campaign was for paid media – mostly to run ads.

CAMPAIGN BATTLE BETWEEN THE BILLIONAIRES: MARK CUBAN AND ELON MUSK HIT THE TRAIL FOR HARRIS AND TRUMP

But the vice president still enjoyed a large cash-on-hand advantage over Trump entering October.

The Harris campaign reported $187 million in its coffers at the end of September, compared to $119 million for the Trump campaign.

The fundraising totals reported by the two major party campaigns don't include additional money raked in by the two national party committees, other affiliated organizations – both campaigns use a slew of affiliated fundraising committees to haul in cash – or aligned super-PACs supporting Harris and Trump.

The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race on July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.

The Harris campaign on Sunday spotlighted its grassroots donors, as it announced that 95% of its donations in the past three months were under $200.

This isn't the first time Trump's faced a fundraising deficit. He raised less than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his White House victory and Biden four years ago in his re-election defeat.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that "the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money."

However, he emphasized that "we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we’re talking to and feel very comfortable that we’re going to be able to see this campaign through and we’re going to win on Nov. 5."

The presidential campaigns later this week will give us another look at their finances – as they're required on Thursday to file reports to the Federal Election Commission for their fundraising for the first 16 days of October.

Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used to – among other things – hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers, and for candidate travel.
A top political handicapper shifted its rating on Monday in the pivotal Pennsylvania Senate race, signaling dwindling chances for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey's re-election.

Unveiling two ratings changes roughly two weeks from Election Day, the Cook Political Report indicated heightened competition in both Pennsylvania and Nebraska, where an independent candidate is threatening to unseat an incumbent Republican.

In Pennsylvania, the race between incumbent Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick is now considered a "Toss Up," according to the handicapper. The battle was previously rated "Lean Democrat."

SCHUMER-TIED GROUP DROPS MILLIONS AGAINST TED CRUZ AS DEMS EYE PICKUP OPPORTUNITY IN TEXAS

Cook cited McCormick "shoring up the GOP base and making gains in the western part of the state," as part of its justification. It also noted that while Casey has a several point advantage over his opponent in public polls, the race is reportedly within the margin of error in both Democratic and Republican internal surveys.

Casey's race is now in the same category as Senate races in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

The ratings change comes as the presidential election between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is practically tied in the battleground state. With split-ticket voting becoming increasingly rare, it's very likely that whichever party wins the White House will also win the Senate race.

Casey defeated McCormick among likely voters 48% to 44% in a recent New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll. The survey of 857 Pennsylvania voters was conducted between Oct. 7 and 10. The margin of error was +/- 3.8 percentage points.

Republicans also took a hit in the ratings shifts, with Sen. Deb Fischer's race in Nebraska moved again to demonstrate a quickly developing tight race. The match-up shifted from "Likely Republican" to "Lean Republican."

Independent candidate Dan Osborn, a union leader and mechanic, has appeared to take Fischer's re-election campaign by surprise with his popularity just weeks from the election. No Democrat candidate was nominated in the race.

Despite the notable challenge, "we still think the heavy red hue of the state wins out, GOP attacks on Democratic efforts to covertly boost Osborn break through and that Fischer makes it across the finish line," Cook wrote.

Fischer's re-election bid is now in the same category as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

Prosecutors backed by left-wing billionaire George Soros face tough elections in 2024 — even in deep-blue California.

Voters in San Francisco recalled radical San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin in June 2022. Though he was not backed directly by Soros, Boudin was aligned with Soros’s “criminal justice reform” agenda.

It was the beginning of a pushback that has lasted through today, spreading to Oakland and to Los Angeles as well.

In Alameda County, which includes Oakland, Soros-backed District Attorney Pamela Price faces a tough uphill fight in a recall election, after a surge in local crime was compounded by questions about nepotism in Price’s office.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Sunday that Price appears to be losing, despite a rally of 100 left-wing supporters:

Groups that support the recall include all of the county’s 14 police unions and the union that represents prosecutors in Price’s office. … The recall campaign has raised about $3.7 million, far more than the Price’s campaign’s $354,000, according to finance records.

“Some of the supporters who attended the rally held signs that read, ‘We won’t go back’ and ‘Defend our democracy’,” according to the Chronicle, though in fact the recall is a democratic process.

In Southern California, as Breitbart News has reported, Boudin’s predecessor in San Francisco, the Soros-backed Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón, may have survived two recall petition attempts, but is losing badly in his first full reelection fight.

A Los Angeles Times/University of California Berkeley poll of likely voters earlier this month found Gascón earning only 21% support, far behind 51% for challenger (and former Republican) Nathan Hochman, with 28% undecided.

If Price, Gascón, and others lose their elections in deep-blue cities in a left-wing state, it will send a signal about the failure of radical “criminal justice reform” policies that will resonate in cities throughout the country.

Former President Donald Trump put on the apron of the golden arches Sunday to serve French fries at a McDonald’s in Feasterville, Pennsylvania.

“I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,” Trump said from the drive-thru window. The billionaire real estate mogul manned the fast food shift after the Washington Free Beacon reported in August the Democrat presidential nominee likely fabricated her experience as a McDonald’s fry cook.

Many people are saying this was awesome. pic.twitter.com/asb8vzEwUJ — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 20, 2024

“McDonald’s boasts that one in eight Americans has worked at the fast food chain, and Harris, whose campaign is light on policy and heavy on image, has been using her fast food job to portray what the Washington Post, in a credulous piece this month on the Harris-McDonald’s connection, described as ‘her humble background,'” the Beacon reported this summer. “For decades,” however, “Harris never mentioned it, not on the campaign trail nor in two books. It’s absent from a job application and résumé she submitted a year after she graduated from college.” Even “third-party biographers did not write about it.”

Harris was asked about the apparent fabrication in her first solo sit-down interview with MSNBC two months after becoming the Democrats’ de facto nominee.

“Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. So I just want to ask you, yes or no,” said the network’s Stephanie Ruhle. “At any point in your life, have you served two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun … working at McDonald’s, yes or no? That’s it.”

“I have,” Harris said. “It was not a small job. Like, I did fries.”

“Easy question,” wrote Trump’s former director of national intelligence, Ric Grenell on X several days later. “Which McDonald’s?”

The vice president never named which restaurant she supposedly worked in a job that she never mentioned until two years into her term as a senator from California in 2019.

“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote in a social media post Sunday. “Additionally, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are killing franchises, want to end all franchises, which will destroy values and jobs. Also, remember, from me, No Tax On Tips!”

Despite her constant cackling, we learned last week that Vice President Kamala Harris isn’t very funny. In fact, she can be downright grouchy if you ask her a difficult question.

On the other hand, the guy the left and corporate media have painted as the next Hitler is a hoot.

‘What are You Talking About?’

In the first real interview that the Democrat Party’s replacement presidential candidate has done in her Reader’s Digest campaign, the real Kamala Harris came through — a vacuous pretender who is ill-prepared for the job she is seeking. More than that, Harris came across as angry, arrogant, and self-entitled when Fox News “Special Report” anchor Brett Baier tested her empty answers.

The accomplice media, in full cover-her-butt mode, blasted Baier for being mean to the vice president, for interrupting her when she repeatedly refused to answer the questions he had asked. Some of the usual corporate media suspects lauded Harris as brave for going into the “lion’s den” of the “right-wing” Fox News in the first place. J6 conspiracy theorist Adam Kinzinger insisted Harris “totally schooled” Baier, leading any rational person to wonder whether the bitter former congressman actually watched the interview.

She wasn’t brave, and she wasn’t equipped to handle actual policy and agenda questions on her record. That’s because that part of her political brain — if ever fully formed — has atrophied so badly from a legacy media that refuses to challenge Harris’ rainbow of platitudes and garbled sentences. At one point in the truncated conversation, Harris stumbled, as she has multiple times, over one of the most basic of questions: how would Harris’ presidency be different from Biden’s? Harris responded in part by claiming that her presidency would “not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency.” But Baier continued to press, noting how Harris’ platform advertises “a new way forward” and the need to “turn the page.” He asked the candidate what she would actually be “turning the page from” after having already been in the White House for nearly four years. Harris responded by attacking Donald Trump, essentially claiming he is the reason why Americans need a change.

Baier went on to note how, according to pollsters, 79 percent of “likely voters” think the country is on the “wrong track.” He noted how “that track follows three and a half years of [Harris] being vice president and President Biden being president.”

“Why are they saying that?” he asked, clarifying once again how she has “been in office for three and a half years.”

Harris responded by noting how “Donald Trump has been running for office.”

“But you’ve been the person holding the office,” Baier pushed back.

Clearly agitated, Harris shot back, “You and I both know what I’m talking about. You and I both know what I’m talking about.”

“I actually don’t. What are you talking about?” Baier asked.

The confusion is understandable. Confused is how Harris leaves the listeners of her obfuscating word salad babblings, which often expose her ignorance.

Madam Vice President was apparently reverting back to the main talking point of a candidate whose actual policy positions are wildly anti-American. That talking point: Trump is bad.

‘When did you First Notice’

Normally, Harris can get away with hammering the “Trump bad” message, while tossing in a dash of her vapid “dreams and aspirations” banter. But Baier didn’t follow the usual corporate media script. He didn’t take Harris’ gibberish nonanswers for an answer.

“Last night, Kamala Harris once again refused to name a single policy difference between her and Joe Biden. Does that sound like a new way forward to you?” Vance said in a post on X the morning following Kamala’s Fox interview.

During the interview, the Fox News anchor also particularly challenged Harris on her record on the border and illegal immigration. However, Harris seemed to largely stand by the current administration’s disastrous border policy decisions and, when pressed, “only sort of apologized to the families of victims killed by illegal immigrants let into the U.S. by … Biden-Harris,” before once again attacking Trump, as The Federalist reported on Wednesday.

Baier also asked Harris what she knew and when she knew it regarding her boss and his pronounced cognitive decline, as The Federalist previously reported.

“You say now [Trump is] unstable, he’s not well, you say he’s mentally not stable,” Baier said, before noting that Harris “told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game.”

“When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?” he asked.

Harris appeared defensive.

“Joe Biden, I have watched in — from the Oval Office to the Situation Room. And he has the judgment and the experiment — experience to do exactly what he has done, in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,” Harris said.

She refused to acknowledge what most of the country has watched over the past four years. After all, if Biden is still so sharp, why did he drop out of the race?

Down Deep, Everybody Knows

Harris’ handlers know better than anyone what a train wreck she is. That’s likely why the vice president has done relatively few interviews — fewer still in which her nonsense has actually been challenged. After the interview, Baier claimed the vice president ultimately showed up late for the interview after her campaign team “pared the allotted time he had with her,” as the New York Post reported on Wednesday.

“We were supposed to start at 5 p.m. This was the time they gave us. Originally, we were going to do 25 or 30 minutes. They came in and said, ‘Well, maybe 20.’ So, it’s already getting whittled down. And then the vice president showed up [at] about 5:15 [p.m.]. We were pushing the envelope to be able to turn it around for the top of the 6 o’clock,” Baier said following the interview.

Baier also said that “multiple Harris campaign aides were signaling him to end the interview — halting the tough questioning minutes before the half-hour mark,” the New York Post reported. In a post-interview follow-up with Fox News Host Sean Hannity, Baier noted how “[Harris’] people — like probably four people” were motioning for him to end the interview and were “very animated.”

“Madam Vice President, they’re wrapping me very hard here,” Baier said in the interview, as the final awkward seconds came to an end.

It was not a good look all around for Harris, who has been losing ground in the polls. Yes, making the vice president finally answer real questions exposed her many inadequacies. But more so, Harris’ agitated responses punctuated by her indignant sense of victimhood showed voters the kind of hot-tempered politico that so many of her former staff members apparently had the misfortune to know.

A Truer Snapshot of the Candidates

Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump left them laughing at the New York City political event of the season that Harris decided to skip.

The GOP’s presidential nominee showcased the biting sense of humor he’s known for at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner in New York City. Even CNN’s Trump-hating Brian Stelter had to admit the man that he and his corporate media pals have long villainized “was funny.”

“I thought he actually got a few great jokes in. I thought the best moment was [when] he talked about the assassination attempts and made light of what he’s experienced,” Stelter said on CNN following the annual benefit for Catholic charities.

Trump, who was nearly assassinated when a gunman shot him in the ear during a July campaign rally in Pennsylvania, told the assembled New York City elite he couldn’t come up with the usual self-deprecating lines expected of the participants.

“I guess I just don’t see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time,” the former president joked.

“I think he’s experiencing real trauma, real PTSD as a result of the shootings,” Stelter said. “But he’s still able to have a light moment in this room, and he took advantage of the fact that Kamala Harris wasn’t there.”

Harris skipped the event, something few presidential candidates have done over the fundraiser’s long run. She did record a video for the festivities, appearing with comedian Molly Shannon who brought back her 1990s Saturday Night Live character, Mary Katherine Gallagher, an armpit-sniffing Catholic school student. It was hard to say what was creepier and cringier — a 60-year-old Molly Shannon in a Catholic girl uniform, or a pretend presidential candidate badly acting in a hastily produced “comedy” clip.

The Fox News interview and the Al Smith dinner might just combine to be the real October Surprise, showing voters the real presidential hopefuls — a funny former president who commands the room and an angry vice president not ready to lead.

Matt Kittle is a senior elections correspondent for The Federalist. An award-winning investigative reporter and 30-year veteran of print, broadcast, and online journalism, Kittle previously served as the executive director of Empower Wisconsin.
CNN host John Berman asked Harris-Walz campaign senior national spokesperson Ian Sams point-blank Monday why there are currently a large number of undecided voters just weeks ahead of the 2024 election.

Berman questioned why there is a chunk of voters who remain undecided despite Sams’ argument that Republican nominee Donald Trump is spewing “dangerous and divisive rhetoric.” The Harris campaign spokesperson responded that much of the American public does not have the time to pay as close of attention to the election, and thus may be unaware of Trump’s alleged rhetoric.

“Why do you think there are still undecided voters, then? If what you say is true, if how you see it is so clear, why are there still people out there who do not see it as you clearly as you do, who do not hear the Arnold Palmer comments as disqualifying?” Berman asked, referencing Trump bringing up late golf star Arnold Palmer’s penis during a Saturday rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

“Look, people are still trying to make up their mind,” Sams said. “We live in a very divided country, it’s going to be an extremely close election, both candidates have consolidated their party’s support behind them, we’re competing for a very small sliver of voters who are still trying to make up their mind. People are living their lives, people are busy, people are taking care of their kids, they’re going to work, they may not be paying as close attention to politics as you and I are, John, but when they do pay attention it’s in the final few weeks before the election.”

WATCH:

The CNN host further asked if the voters are hearing Harris’ policy proposals if they are consistently hearing the campaign’s criticisms of Trump. Sams replied that the voters have and will continue to hear the vice president talk about her plans for the future.

Roughly 1.2 million people are still truly undecided ahead of the election, according to a New York Times/Siena College analysis. Black voters made up 21% of the undecideds, while young voters also make up a large portion of that voter bloc.

Undecided voters make up between 2% to 5% of the overall electorate, but could ultimately decide the election with the race being so close, according to USA Today.

The number of undecided voters in the current electorate stood at 4% in September, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten found. The majority of the undecided voters classified the economy and inflation as their top issues, while a significantly lower number of these voters believed this election was the “most important election” of their lifetime.

Litigation could be a defining factor in the presidential race — or it could mean nothing.

For a number of election-related lawsuits across the country, the stakes are high but the potential impact is unknown. Election law experts say it’s too soon to tell whether any of the recent rulings or pending cases will have anything like a determinative effect on the election.

“It’s mostly wait and see for me,” Derek Muller, who teaches election law at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

A Georgia judge blocked on Tuesday a new rule from the state’s election board requiring counties to hand-count ballots.

In another closely-watched case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in an Oct. 7 ruling it would not decide issues related to mail in ballots this close to the election, including a bid to prevent counties from tossing mail in ballots with an incorrect date. (RELATED: Judge Chutkan Says It Would Be ‘Election Interference’ If She Didn’t Release Jack Smith’s Evidence Against Trump)

“Any one of these decisions could end up having a substantial impact in the election, or, they could all be meaningless,” election law attorney Audrey Perry Martin told the DCNF, noting the rulings could still be appealed. “However, given how close the polls are this year it is possible, although not likely, that the results of one of these cases will affect enough ballots in a battleground state to be determinative in the Presidential election.”

The bottom line: it’s impossible to know until election day or later. Many issues are yet to be decided, and rulings could still be appealed.

“I expect litigation to be ongoing in the battleground states immediately following the election as well,” Martin said. “This increased election litigation leading up to and immediately after the election appears to be the new normal in Presidential election years.”

Former President Donald Trump now leads Vice President Kamala Harris in all key swing states, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages. But the race is still tight — in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump’s lead is under one percent.

“In a very close election that turns on Pennsylvania, lots of fights over absentee ballots might become important,” Muller told the DCNF. “But so far, it’s been pretty ordinary, and rulings in cases like Georgia have been pretty marginal and unlikely to have any material impact on the outcome.”

Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told the DCNF there likely won’t be major rule changes between now and the election. Courts will likely be “deterred by the Purcell doctrine, the principle established by the U.S. Supreme Court that says courts should not make changes in election rules shortly before an election,” he explained.

Recently, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has targeted states for efforts to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, hitting both Alabama and Virginia with lawsuits for doing so too close to the election. A judge ordered Alabama to stop its effort on Wednesday. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

While the litigation won’t have an effect in the two states, where von Spakovsky believes the margin of victory will be much larger than “the number of alien voters in question,” he said the lawsuits are an example of DOJ weaponization.

“[The] DOJ should be helping these states, not attacking them, and investigating/prosecuting these aliens for violating federal law that prohibits aliens from registering,” he said.

The most important battles to watch could be post-election litigation.

“If it is a close election, I expect we will see an explosion of litigation by the losing side, whether it is Trump or Harris,” von Spakovsky said. “That has been the trend since the 2000 election, which generated a huge increase in lawsuits filed over election rules, regulations and practices.”

Billionaire Elon Musk announced Saturday evening at a Trump campaign event in Pennsylvania that he will award one person $1 million every day before Election Day.

Musk, who endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump after he was shot in July, launched the America PAC following the former president’s return to Butler rally in early October. The X (formerly Twitter) owner and SpaceX founder held a rally in Harrisburg, where he revealed the first winner of the America PAC’s $1 million petition signer giveaway.

“I have a surprise for you. We’re going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,” Musk told an enthusiastic crowd.

Musk’s political action committee (PAC) targets the seven following battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It features a petition pledging support for the First Amendment and Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which signers can receive $47 for each registered voter referred to sign, according to the America PAC’s official website.

The first lucky petition signer, John Dreher, celebrated his seven-figure fortune when called up to the stage by Musk.

“Thanks Elon, this is great. I’m really ecstatic!” Dreher said as he held a large $1 million check.

Dreher told Musk he was a huge fan for ten years. The America PAC’s official X account featured the first winner in a video promoting the petition. (RELATED: Trump Announces Elon Musk Announces Elon Musk’s Role In Future Administration)

“When he called me, the first thing that happened was, you know, I screamed and, it was $1 million and I was pumping my check in the air, pumping my arms in the air,” Dreher said, describing his experience meeting Musk. “Actually meeting Elon, I kind of forgot about the money for a little bit.”

The America PAC champions values including “secure borders, safe cities, free speech, sensible spending, a fair justice system and self-protection,” according to its website. Musk launched the America PAC with the purpose of electing Trump to a second term.

“The goal of the $1M/day prize is to maximize awareness of our petition to support the Constitution,” Musk wrote on X.

The America PAC also has a team working to boost voter registration and turnout in swing states. Pay starts at $30 per hour and performance bonuses are offered, the website states.

Trump announced in early September that Musk agreed to take charge of a Government Efficiency Commission if he wins back the White House.
Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro couldn’t name “one policy difference” between Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden on Sunday, despite NBC host Kristen Welker giving him multiple opportunities to do so.

Since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has struggled to distance her campaign from her current role in Biden’s administration. On “Meet the Press,” Welker questioned Shapiro about whether he believes Harris has “done enough” to separate herself from Biden, given her recent failure to detail how her administration would be different.

“You know, Kristen, I think what is clear, this is a race not between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, but between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and on that there are clear contrasts. Kamala Harris wants to cut taxes for the middle-class and small businesses. Donald Trump and his economic policies would raise costs for middle-class families,” Shapiro began.

The Democratic governor continued by expressing his support of Harris’ “approach to foreign policy” and her push to “restore” Roe v. Wade, while claiming former President Donald Trump wants more “chaos” and less “freedom.”

“I think you have a clear contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump,” Shapiro continued. “And voters are going to the polls, literally right now all across America, focusing on that choice. Not a choice between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.”

Welker, however, noted that a majority of voters have not approved of Biden’s handling on issues such as the economy and inflation, and asked Shapiro if he could name “one key policy difference” between Harris and Biden, or describe how Harris’ administration would “look different” from the current president’s.

WATCH:

“I’ve been really encouraged by the amount of energy that Kamala Harris — Vice President Harris — has put into focusing on how she will cut taxes for small businesses,” Shapiro said. “The focus on child care tax credit expansion. That’s something I’ve done here in Pennsylvania, we’ve seen that work to ease the burden on families. I think the focus on those kinds of things are particularly important and those are the kinds of things I think Kamala Harris has brought specifically to this race.”

“Those aren’t necessarily differences though. They’re an expansion or tweak to some extent of what’s been done. Can you name one policy difference?” Welker asked a second time.

The Democratic governor stated the “contrast” he was “focused on” is between Harris and Trump, echoing his previous statements on Trump’s “chaos.”

Recent polling on Biden’s approval rating found that only 39% of voters believe his handling of the U.S. is satisfactory, slightly above his lowest approval rating of 36% in July, according to Gallup.

Harris faced backlash after telling ABC’s “The View” on Oct. 8 that “nothing” came to her mind when asked if she would “have done something differently than President Biden” over the past four years. The vice president additionally failed to give a clear answer on how her administration would be moving the country “forward,” while interviewing with Fox’s Bret Baier on Wednesday.

MSNBC host Alex Witt and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) criticized former President Donald Trump for his visit to a Philadelphia-area McDonald’s where he served customers, stating that there was “no logic to it.”

“He has gone to a McDonald’s,” Witt said. “He’s going to this McDonald’s, and he’s in the Philadelphia area. He’s going to work a fryer, apparently, before he goes to the Steelers versus Jets game. If you’re on his campaign, and I know you are certainly not, I’m not making any implication of that. But, what is the logic behind this — going to a McDonald’s?”

Witt added that Trump likes “Big Mac and Filet-o-Fish” from McDonald’s and continued to question what Trump’s visit to McDonald’s was “about.”

“There’s no logic to it,” Lee responded:

It’s a stunt. He has not put forth an economic agenda. He, as you know, appears to be not well. And, he’s engaged in some really bizarre types of activities during this campaign. So, this is just another one of those stunts that he will continue on through the campaign, and I think we really need to really focus on making sure that he is not elected of course.

On Sunday afternoon, Trump visited a McDonald’s in Philadelphia where he learned how to make french fries, handed out orders, and spoke to customers in the drive-thru.

One customer informed Trump that he was praying for the former president, and that Trump was “the type of person” they wanted to serve as president.

“We pray for you and you are the type of person we want to be the president,” the customer said, before his wife added, “Thank you for taking the bullet for us.”

“Mr. President, please don’t let the United States become Brazil,” another customer in the drive-thru told Trump. “My native Brazil.”

“We’re going to make it better than ever,” Trump responded.

Trump’s visit to McDonald’s comes as Vice President Kamala Harris alleged that she used to work at a McDonald’s.

During an interview with Drew Barrymore in April, Harris was asked about rumors that the vice president had previously “worked at McDonald’s.”

“I did,” Harris responded. “Yes, I did work at McDonald’s. When I was at school… I did fries. I did fries, and then I did the cashier.”

The Washington Free Beacon reported in August that while Harris was running as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election, she claimed during a “labor rally in Las Vegas” in 2019 that she “was a student when” she used to work at a McDonald’s.

Harris’s work at McDonald’s, which allegedly took place at a franchise in the California Bay Area the summer after her freshman year in college, is a recent addition to her carefully curated life story. For decades, Harris never mentioned it, not on the campaign trail nor in two books. It’s absent from a job application and résumé she submitted a year after she graduated from college. Third-party biographers did not write about it. Not until Harris ran for president in 2019 and spoke to a labor rally in Las Vegas did she mention the job, telling the crowd that she “was a student when I was working in a McDonald’s.”

The outlet added that while “it is possible that Harris” used to work at McDonald’s, “the absence of that detail in public records and her campaign’s coyness and refusal to provide” additional details on the subject raise several questions.

As Breitbart News reported, Harris has attempted to use the claims that she used to work at a McDonald’s as a way to prove that she “knows what it’s like to be middle class.”
Donald Trump is taking a political risk by centering migration — not the nation’s economy — in his two-week dash to the ballot box, says the New York Times.

“In the final weeks of a campaign …. Mr. Trump is going with his gut, doubling down on the rhetoric that he believes won him the 2016 election and using immigration and the border to form the core of his closing message to voters,” the newspaper reported October 19.

Migration ‘“beats out the economy” with voters, Donald Trump told his October 15 rally, the newspaper said. “It’s not even close.”

Immigration and the economy are wrapped together, Trump’s campaign told the newspaper:

Asked to explain Mr. Trump’s focus in the closing days of the race, a Trump spokesman, Brian Hughes, said: “President Trump rightfully recognizes that Kamala Harris’s porous border is at the heart of so many issues, whether it is high housing prices, low wages or overwhelmed hospitals and schools. An open border means that taxpayer dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants, instead of benefiting citizens. President Trump’s closing message is all about putting Americans first and restoring prosperity.”

The Times reporters did not mention that Kamala Harris’ 2024 economic platform requires a huge inflow of migrants. A Democratic-leaning advocacy group, for example, predicted she will import 12.3 million migrants during the next four years.

Amazingly, Harris has not tried to revive her campaign with a promise to reduce the inflow of economic migrants, despite her promising to upgrade border security many times.

RELATED — CNN’s Zakaria: Biden Should Go Back to Trump’s Immigration Policies

A growing number of GOP leaders — including Trump’s pick for Vice President, JD Vance — recognize that the federal migration policy imposes huge pocketbook and civic costs on ordinary Americans.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for example, wrote an October 17 article for CompactMag.com, showing that migration has damaged ordinary Americans:

… immigration remained within sustainable limits through most of the 1970s and ’80s, and it remained within most Americans’ grasp to make ends meet. My own parents, themselves immigrants from Cuba, earned enough to buy a home and raise four children on the salaries of a hotel bartender and stay-at-home mom who occasionally worked as a maid. As recently as 1985, meanwhile, the average US-born man could afford a middle-class lifestyle for a family of four on about 40 weeks of wages (compared with about 62 weeks today). In other words, the American Dream was alive and well, for immigrants and natives alike.

But Washington, DC, changed the rules for ordinary Americans by supercharging global trade and migration, Rubio wrote:

The consequences of this for US-born men have been catastrophic. The percentage of prime-age men now working or looking for work is close to what it was in 1940, in the throes of the Great Depression. Meanwhile, one economist estimates that by 2016, immigrants had “increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent.” The Biden-Harris administration has only compounded the problem. By one government count, the administration has admitted at least 6.5 million more illegal migrants since then—and that doesn’t include an estimated 1.5 million “gotaways.”

Some Wall Street investors are touting an alternative, low-migration strategy that would expand economic growth and prosperity.

“I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued:

That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.

In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding:

So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme.

Breitbart News has closely c0vered the federal government’s post-1990 use of migration to boost the U.S. consumer economy by extracting cheap workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries.

Extraction Migration

Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries.

The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages, subsidizing low-productivity companies, boosting rents, and spiking real estate prices.

The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout, slowed high-tech innovation, shrunk trade, crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded, low-status Americans.

Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign.

The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom.

The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.
MSNBC host Alex Witt and Democratic California Rep. Barbara Lee were puzzled by former President Donald Trump’s visit to a Pennsylvania McDonald’s on Sunday, where he helped out while a crowd cheered him on from outside.

Since September, Trump has repeatedly accused Harris of lying about working at a McDonald’s in Alameda, California, during the summer of 1983. On “Alex Witt Reports,” the MSNBC host shifted her interview with Lee to discuss Trump’s visit, showing a series of videos where he wore a McDonald’s apron and helped cook some of the food.

“He’s going to work a fryer, apparently, before he goes to the Steelers vs. Jets game. I mean, if you are on his campaign – and I know you are certainly not, I’m not making any implication of that. What is the logic behind this?” Witt asked. “We know the guy likes big macs and fillet of fish, and he’s used the word love to describe the way he feels about the food there before. But what’s this about?”

Lee told the host there was “no logic” behind the move and argued that the former president “has not put forth an economic agenda.” (RELATED: CNN Can’t Stop Talking About ‘Arnold Palmer’s Penis’ While Discussing Trump Rally)

“There’s no logic to it, it’s a stunt. He has not put forth an economic agenda. He, as you know, appears to be not well. He’s engaged in some really bizarre types of activities during this campaign. So this is just another one of those stunts that he will continue on through the campaign, and I think that we need to really focus on making sure that he is not elected, of course, because he is a threat to our democracy,” Lee said.

WATCH:

Witt went on to highlight Trump’s accusations of Harris lying about working at the fast-food restaurant, questioning what the “point” was of the call out. In response, Lee defended the vice president, stating that “she tells the truth” while Trump is “constantly telling lies.”

However, videos from the event show a massive crowd had gathered for the former president at the Bucks County, Pennsylvania McDonald’s. Trump was seen shaking hands with employees, frying the store’s french fries and handing out food to supporters through the drive-by window.

During an interaction with one supporter who stated her name was Brazil, pleaded with the former president to not “let the United States become Brazil.”

“Oh we’ll keep it good. We’re going to make it better than ever, okay?” Trump said as he could be seen thanking her as the crowd in the background could be heard cheering.

The crowd outside the facility flooded the parking lot, with Trump flags either being held by supporters or flown from the backs of cars. While Harris has maintained that she worked at the fast-food restaurant in California, Trump responded by saying he’s “now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala.”

Throughout CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, the topic of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer’s genitalia was repeatedly raised by Democratic and Independent guests, as well as host Jake Tapper, while discussing former President Donald Trump’s recent rally in Pennsylvania.

Trump appeared on stage Saturday in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, the hometown of Palmer, where he paid tribute to the late golfer’s life and their friendship. However, CNN’s focus on Sunday seemed to center solely on Trump describing Palmer as “all man,” as Tapper opened the show by pressing Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on the topic.

“Mr. Speaker, you’re crossing all over the country. You’re working hard to get Republicans over the line in this election. You’re talking about substantive issues. Is this really the closing message you want voters to hear from Donald Trump — stories about Arnold Palmer’s penis?” Tapper asked.

While Johnson wanted to focus on Harris’ record versus Trump’s rhetoric, the CNN host continued to press him on Trump’s comments, claiming that the former president’s joke may contribute to “concerns” voters have about Trump’s mental “fitness.”

“But if President Biden had gone on stage and spoke about the size of a pro-golfers penis, I think you would be on this show right now saying you were shocked and appalled and you would suggest it was evidence of his cognitive decline,” Tapper said.

“I know you want to talk about policy, and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity and his stability. Why is he talking about Arnold Palmer’s penis in front of Pennsylvania voters?” Tapper questioned.

Johnson called out the CNN host, stating that he seemed “to like that line a lot,” before defending Trump and highlighting the policies of the Biden-Harris administration that are driving voters to support the former president.

WATCH:

Later in the show, Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also addressed the comments while discussing his defense of Harris. Tapper had initially pressed Sanders on why Harris has yet to hold a public campaign event with him, despite having done so with former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. (RELATED: Elon Musk To Award One Person $1 Million Every Day Before Election Day)

“But also last night, Jake, you may have noticed Trump held a rally and the big issue that he talked about — and please forgive me if I mention this on television — was apparently the size of Arnold Palmer’s penis. That was the major issue that he discussed,” Sanders said.

WATCH:

The topic was brought up a third time by Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean during a roundtable discussion with other strategists. Dean questioned the group about a recent criticism of Trump’s “language,” comparing some of his word choices to Hitler’s, before highlighting his tribute to Palmer.

“This is stuff from the 1930s. This is Hitler stuff. I wonder why Republicans aren’t calling it out, not to mention calling out the 12 minutes talking about parts of Arnold Palmer,” Dean said.

WATCH:

During Trump’s speech to Pennsylvania residents at the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Westmoreland County, the crowd could be heard laughing as Trump shared stories about Palmer. Throughout the roughly 12-minute tribute, the former president referred to Palmer as “all man” for less than a minute and never mentioned the golfer’s genitalia directly.

But Arnold Palmer was all man and I say that with all due respect to women. I love women. But this guy, this is a guy that was all man. This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they come out of there, they said, ‘Oh my God, that’s unbelievable!'” Trump said as the crowd laughed.

“I had to say. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold and say, ‘Man.’ But he was really something special, Arnold was something special. So I just want to tell you, you’re very lucky — the people who live in Latrobe — and it’s an honor for me to be here because of him. He was — actually he was a great man and I don’t think there would be golf to the extent that you have it today, it probably wouldn’t be that way without the Great Arnold Palmer. So enjoy it everybody,” Trump added.

WATCH:

Despite the relatively brief mention of Palmer during the roughly two-hour campaign event, headlines from corporate media outlets like NPR, the Associated Press and The New York Times focused on the quick comment from Trump’s speech, which lasted over an hour, with some calling it “an off-colored joke.”

Harris’ campaign has attempted to appeal to male voters, specifically black and Latino men, over the past month, as polls indicate she has been slipping among these key voting blocs.

While Harris has made strong strides with women voters, polls show she is falling significantly behind Trump with male voters. An NBC poll released in mid-September reveals a 33-point gender gap between Harris and Trump, with the former president leading Harris among men by 12 points, while Harris leads Trump among women by 21 points.

In early October, the vice president brought former President Barack Obama onto a Pennsylvania stage; however, he quickly faced criticism for scolding male voters for not supporting Harris. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows that while women in the key swing state of Pennsylvania favor the vice president 55% to 41%, men favor Trump 52% to 39%.

As the 2024 election approaches, the Biden-Harris administration’s foreign policy has left the world in utter chaos and teetering on the brink of World War III — from the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal to the Israel-Hamas war — all while Russia, China, and Iran, once restrained under Trump’s tough stance, are emboldened, raising concerns that a Harris term would spell irreversible disaster.

Since taking office, the Biden-Harris administration has made a series of failed foreign policy moves, many of which have shifted long-standing U.S. strategies. President Joe Biden himself recently underscored Vice President Kamala Harris’s involvement in such decisions, describing her as “a major player in everything we’ve done,” as he directly tied her to their administration’s policy failures.

In fact, last month Biden admitted he had delegated “everything” as commander-in-chief to Harris, including both foreign and domestic policy, a significant admission as Harris has repeatedly attempted to distance herself from the administration’s record.

Meanwhile, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller stated that Harris is directly responsible for the current administration’s failures, particularly on foreign policy, citing her involvement in decisions that led to disastrous results from Afghanistan to Ukraine and the Middle East.

With 8 out of 10 Americans fearing World War III, the Biden-Harris administration faces growing scrutiny over its handling of foreign crises.

Middle East

One of the current administration’s first major foreign policy moves was removing the Houthis from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list, reversing Trump-era policies aimed at curbing the Iranian-backed group. Though the president would later admit the Houthis are “terrorists,” it would come only after dozens of attacks against U.S. military and international commercial warships in the Red Sea.

The decision to delist the Houthis as an FTO was seen as part of the Biden-Harris administration’s broader attempt to revive the failed Obama-era Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), which has been widely criticized for empowering Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism worldwide. The current administration has further emboldened Tehran and its terror proxies through the easing sanctions and by providing the Islamic Republic with financial resources to support terrorism and regional aggression.

Additionally, weak responses to attacks by Iranian-backed militias and policy shifts in the Middle East have been viewed as “appeasing” the theocratic regime. The Biden-Harris administration also allowed sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile to expire last year, a mere six months before a ballistic missile attack on Israel in April. According to a report citing new government data from last week, the Biden-Harris administration gave the Iranian regime access to $200 billion in oil revenues through lax sanctions enforcement.

While under Trump, a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign crippled Iran’s ability to finance proxy terror groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, the Biden-Harris administration’s diplomatic overtures — including efforts to renew the nuclear deal and a more lenient stance on enforcing oil sanctions — have allowed additional revenues to flow to Tehran, enabling it to continue funding terror through its regional proxies.

The consequences came to a head in October 2023 when Hamas, heavily funded by Iran, launched a large-scale assault on Israel which left 1,200 dead inside the Jewish state, over 4,800 more wounded, and at least 240 hostages of all ages taken — of which nearly one hundred remain captive. The vast majority of the victims are civilians and include dozens of American citizens.

The war shocked the region, with critics pointing to the Biden-Harris team’s failure to maintain the hardline pressure Trump applied to Tehran. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the current administration’s “weakness” emboldened Iranian proxies, leading to catastrophic consequences across the Middle East.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war has also highlighted the strained U.S.-Israel relations under the Biden-Harris administration, which began with his administration showing early hostility toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by delaying official meetings. In fact, the administration has reportedly been using a four-part plan, involving diplomatic pressure and protests, to undermine Netanyahu’s government, signaling an unprecedented interference in Israeli domestic politics during a critical war.

In May, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed that the U.S. had withheld a shipment of large bombs to Israel, citing concerns about civilian safety in Rafah during Israel’s ongoing operations against Hamas. In a more recent development, the Biden-Harris administration is reportedly considering an arms embargo on the Jewish State over humanitarian concerns in Gaza, with Harris signaling openness to the idea.

The administration’s executive order which sanctions Israel under the pretext of targeting “extremist settler violence,” empowers the anti-Israel BDS movement and undermines a critical U.S. ally during a time of crisis.

In July, the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) condemned Harris for boycotting Netanyahu’s address to Congress to attend a sorority luncheon, viewing it as a clear signal of hostility toward Israel. Critics argue that it was part of a broader pattern in which Harris has consistently aligned with anti-Israel sentiments, even expressing support for the “emotion” behind protests that have involved overt antisemitism.

This contrasts with Trump’s full support of the Jewish State, exemplified by his decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and the historic Trump-brokered Abraham Accords — peace agreements normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab nations, stabilizing a volatile region, all while avoiding new foreign wars during his presidency.

Afghanistan

The 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal is perhaps the most glaring example of Biden-Harris foreign policy failures, a move that left major U.S. allies questioning the reliability of American commitments, ultimately leading to further global instability.

What was supposed to be a strategic exit from America’s longest war turned into a hasty, disorganized retreat, leaving the country to be swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. The resulting humanitarian disaster and the deaths of U.S. service members during the evacuation were only part of the fallout.

Many blasted the Biden-Harris administration’s “weakness” and “incompetence” while accusing the president of allowing Taliban terrorists to “call the shots” by “dictating foreign policy” and calling for his immediate resignation.

As fighting intensified in Afghanistan, the Biden-Harris team set a withdrawal timeline while assuring that the U.S.-backed Afghan military could withstand the Taliban, but within weeks, Kabul fell, President Ashraf Ghani fled with $169 million, and the Taliban swiftly seized control of the country despite nearly two decades of U.S. and NATO efforts to build Afghan security forces.

A report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction found that the withdrawal left $7.2 billion worth of U.S. military equipment in the hands of the Taliban, including missiles, aircraft, and biometric devices. Some of the weapons even reportedly ended up in the Gaza Strip, with groups like Hamas potentially utilizing them.

A recent report by the House Foreign Affairs Committee that slams the Biden-Harris administration for prioritizing the optics of the Afghanistan withdrawal over the safety of U.S. personnel, specifically highlights Harris as a key player in the decision-making process. In fact, Harris even admitted she was “the last person in the room” when Biden decided to abruptly evacuate U.S. troops from Afghanistan, boasting of her support for the disastrous decision, while expressing admiration for the president’s supposed courage in making the call.

At the time, former President Trump said the Biden-Harris team “surrendered Afghanistan to terrorists and left thousands of Americans for dead.” The former president also called the bungled withdrawal the “single most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.”

The success of the Taliban, which immediately declared its intentions of imposing a strict Islamic sharia law system on Afghans, has been a growing concern for various groups, including ethnic and religious minorities within Afghanistan.

Furthermore, the Biden-Harris administration faced backlash for a botched drone strike in Kabul, which killed 11 civilians, further tarnishing the U.S. reputation. The withdrawal also exposed failures within the State Department, whose evacuation efforts left thousands of Afghan allies behind, now facing life under Taliban rule.

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates remarked that Biden has been “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy issue” in the last 40 years, a sentiment clearly validated by the Afghanistan debacle.

Russia-Ukraine War

The mishandling of the withdrawal also emboldened adversaries like Russia and China, with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) asserting that the actions of the Biden-Harris administration, together with their executive orders, have “emboldened all the evil leaders of the world.” The chaotic pullout signaled U.S. vulnerability, leading experts to argue that President Vladimir Putin saw it as a display of weakness, paving the way for Russia’s more aggressive actions.

Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, argued that Putin’s invasions of Crimea in 2014 under Obama and Ukraine in 2022 under the Biden-Harris administration demonstrate that “two weak presidents” emboldened Putin, further linking the current conflict to the “humiliation of the United States.”

The now nearly three-year-long Russian invasion of Ukraine underscores the Biden-Harris administration’s mishandling of U.S. deterrence.

The president’s now infamous comment about a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine, made in early 2022, sent the wrong message to Putin, with the indecision emboldening Moscow to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Initially, the Biden-Harris team even offered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ride out of the country instead of providing the military support Ukraine desperately needed. Such decisions have not only deepened the crisis but also led to widespread criticism of the president’s lack of foresight in managing Europe’s security situation.

U.S. weakness under Biden-Harris stands in sharp contrast with Trump’s foreign policy, where under his watch, Putin refrained from aggressive moves.

Trump has argued that if Harris wins, she would prolong the Russia-Ukraine war and continue funneling billions of U.S. tax dollars into Ukraine, warning that her inaction could lead to “millions” of deaths and potentially a global conflict.

China

The Biden-Harris administration’s approach to China has been similarly criticized, with current policies seen as lacking, and Beijing emboldened by American inaction.

From the infamous spy balloon incident, where a Chinese surveillance balloon was allowed to traverse U.S. airspace, to rising military threats in the South China Sea and over Taiwan, the current administration’s responses have been criticized as inadequate, including the failure to impose sanctions on Beijing.

China’s assertiveness, having grown, has led to fears that Taiwan could be the next flashpoint of major conflict.

Under Trump, the U.S. took a much harder stance on China through tariffs and aggressive diplomacy. Trump’s administration also built stronger alliances with nations in the Indo-Pacific, sending a clear message to Beijing that any aggressive moves would have serious consequences.

Global Threats

Beyond these major crises, the Biden-Harris administration’s foreign policy blunders span numerous regions.

North Korea, for instance, has openly resumed arms deals with Russia, further straining global security dynamics. The current administration’s failure to rein in Iran has allowed Tehran to infiltrate U.S. politics, raising alarms about Iran-backed operatives influencing domestic policy.

Meanwhile, Russia’s development of hypersonic missiles has gone largely unchecked, marking a dangerous escalation in the global arms race.

Trump’s foreign policy, in contrast, was defined by a doctrine of deterrence.

The assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani impaired Iran’s ability to conduct terrorist operations across the Middle East. Trump also maintained a strong military presence to dissuade North Korea and China from expanding their militaristic ambitions. His method of diplomacy and maintaining U.S. dominance globally led to a far more stable international environment.

Elections

As the 2024 election nears, foreign policy remains pivotal. While the Biden-Harris administration’s approach has been seen as “emboldening America’s enemies,” Trump is credited with maintaining global stability through strength and clear red lines.

Meanwhile, Harris failed her foreign policy efforts in Central America, as China expanded its influence in the region, and promised investments through her initiatives fell far short of expectations. Other key events include the terminating of Keystone XL, which hurt U.S. energy independence, and green-lighting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline — moves that undermined U.S. leadership globally.

Surrounded by advisers with anti-Israel ties, including her national security adviser Phil Gordon, who is currently under investigation for alleged links to an Iranian influence network, Harris faces increasing scrutiny over her foreign policy team.

Just last month, Harris claimed that no active-duty U.S. troops were engaged in combat; however, U.S. forces remain deployed in Iraq and Syria, facing frequent attacks from Iran-backed militias — prompting more concerns about her grasp of the complexities required for effective foreign policy leadership

Furthermore, she published a policy page on her website, claiming she is “ready to be Commander in Chief on day one,” but cited a notorious foreign policy blunder — mistakenly referring to North Korea as a U.S. ally during her 2022 visit to the Korean Demilitarized Zone — as evidence of her diplomatic experience.

The Biden-Harris administration has also been blamed for contributing to the military’s largest recruitment crisis in decades, with critics pointing to the administration’s focus on “woke” policies like diversity initiatives as a key factor​.

In addition, the current administration is also grappling with massive illegal immigration across the southern border — thanks to the repeal of Trump-era border policies and an economy strained by inflation.

In her role as “Border Czar,” Harris has been blamed for the administration’s failure to enforce immigration laws, which critics argue has compromised national security and led to preventable crimes. Unprecedented crossings of individuals on terrorist watchlists have also been documented at both the southern and northern borders, with some reportedly planning attacks​.

“The Biden-Harris administration has intentionally left us vulnerable,” declared Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX), during a hearing on terror threats from the border, emphasizing the connection between their border policies and the surge in national security risks.

With tensions rising across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, voters face a critical choice: continue the failed Biden-Harris policies or return to Trump’s assertive policies to restore U.S. leadership. with a recent survey revealing that 80% of Americans fear World War III is imminent, the stakes for U.S. foreign policy couldn’t be higher.
Vice President Kamala Harris would not support an expansion of fossil fuel drilling despite her recent campaign boasts about domestic oil production under the Biden administration.

"Just to be clear, Vice President Harris hasn’t said anything that the administration hasn’t already said. She is not promoting expansion [of fossil fuel drilling]. She’s just said that they wouldn’t ban fracking," Camila Thorndike, Harris’ climate engagement director, said in an interview with Politico.

The comments come as Harris has continued to face questions about her stance on energy production, going from supporting a ban on fracking just five years ago to touting the "largest increase in domestic oil production in history" during her time as vice president.

HARRIS TOUTS OIL PRODUCTION DURING 2024 RUN AFTER SAYING COMPANIES NEED TO 'PAY THE PRICE' FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

"We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil," Harris said during a debate with former President Trump in Pennsylvania, a state where the issue of fracking could be a pivotal issue for voters.

"I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels," Harris said.

HARRIS DODGING FLIP FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: ‘PLAYING POLITICS’

Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz has struck a similar tone, arguing during a recent interview with WGAL 8 that the U.S. is "producing more natural gas and more oil than at any time in our history."

But some critics have slammed the campaign’s recent production talking point, arguing that the energy industry was able to achieve record numbers despite Biden administration policies, not because of them.

"In just four years, you and POTUS created the single worst regulatory and legislative environment in our industry's 160-year history. You've put into place 250 separate actions designed to put us out of business. You wanted to put our CEOs in jail, confiscate our capital and prevent our investors from getting any return," the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (OGA) said in a post on X last week. "And in spite of all that – we worked around you, over you and have beat your team. Now you want to take credit for what we did in spite of you. Not gonna let it happen."

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.
Vice President Kamala Harris touted an immigration bill from 2021 as evidence that she and President Biden worked to strengthen U.S. immigration policies ahead of the migrant crisis that has rocked the U.S. in the last three and a half years.

A review of the bill, however, shows it would have paved the way to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.

"At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress – before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system," Harris said when speaking with Fox News’ Bret Baier last week in her first interview with Fox News since Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July and Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket.

"Yes, ma’am. It was called the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021," Baier responded, which Baier described as "essentially a pathway to citizenship."

WHAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS LEFT OUT ABOUT BIDEN ADMIN'S ROLE IN BORDER CRISIS: A TIMELINE

"Exactly," Harris responded before Baier began to say that the bill "was essentially a pathway to citizenship."

Harris' response came after Baier grilled the VP on the Biden-Harris administration reversing Trump border policies upon their inauguration in 2021, including a Trump policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained while awaiting asylum hearings. Baier asked Harris if she "regrets" terminating the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy in light of illegal immigrant males who have allegedly committed ghastly crimes such as murder in the U.S. under the administration.

On Biden and Harris’ first day in office in 2021, the president sent Congress a piece of legislation touted as one that would "restore humanity and American values to our immigration system."

The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 was never enacted, dying in Congress instead, and detailed that in addition to "modernizing" the U.S. immigration system, it explicitly detailed it would "provide pathways to citizenship & strengthen labor protections."

KAMALA HARRIS ASSERTS HER PRESIDENCY 'WILL NOT BE A CONTINUATION' OF BIDEN'S

As Democrats in Congress unveiled the bill in February of that year, the White House estimated that up to 11 million illegal immigrants could earn citizenship through an eight-year plan, including those deported under the Trump administration, Fox News Digital reported at the time.

"Applicants must be physically present in the United States on or before January 1, 2021. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may waive the presence requirement for those deported on or after January 20, 2017 who were physically present for at least three years prior to removal for family unity and other humanitarian purposes. Lastly, the bill further recognizes America as a nation of immigrants by changing the word ‘alien’ to ‘noncitizen’ in our immigration laws," the White House’s fact sheet for the bill stated.

Other items in the bill included granting immediate eligibility for green cards to farmworkers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. It would have also opened up legal pathways to immigration by expanding the controversial green card lottery from 55,000 a year to 80,000 a year and exempting children and spouses from visa cap numbers.

Conservatives in Congress slammed the legislation as an amnesty bill that would not only fail to bolster immigration laws, but encourage people to illegally cross into the U.S.

KAMALA HARRIS REPEATEDLY PIVOTS TO TRUMP WHEN GRILLED ON IMMIGRATION RECORD IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

​​Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called it a "massive proposal for blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the same time." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who was part of the 2013 "Gang of Eight," brushed the legislation off as a non-starter.

Harris was grilled about her immigration policies during her interview with Baier, frequently dodging the questions by responding with criticisms of former President Trump.

DEMS TO INTRODUCE BIDEN-BACKED IMMIGRATION BILL, INCLUDES CITIZENSHIP PATH FOR MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Baier kicked off the interview Wednesday by asking Harris how many illegal immigrants were released by the Biden administration into the country.

"Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration, because I agree with you," Harris responded. "It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. And you know what I'm going to talk about-"

"But just a number," Baier pressed. "Do you think it's 1 million? Three million?"

"Bret, let's just get to the point, OK? The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired," Harris said, before Baier interjected that the Department of Homeland Security estimates 6 million illegal immigrants have been released in the U.S. since the Biden-Harris administration.

Before she became her party’s nominee for president, Kamala Harris had not made a substantial, discernable positive public impact during her nearly four years in the White House. She largely operated under the radar and fell short regarding some of her most high-profile assignments.

She had not universally distinguished herself as a leader. She had not won over swaths of new fans. She had not fully earned her place as next in line. She was known more in Washington circles for her rocky relationships with her staff members and her sagging approval ratings than for anything she had actually accomplished.

HARRIS STRUGGLES TO NAME ‘ONE POLICY’ DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN

To be sure, through the first few years of the Biden-Harris administration, the vice president received praise for assuming an outsize role in the fights for abortion and voting rights, and for building solid relationships with important foreign allies. Although mocked for her word salads and piercing guffaws, she did not overtly undercut the administration’s agenda. For those who saw her up close, she was impressive but not iconic, charismatic but not yet a superstar.

And on July 21, when Joe Biden stepped aside and Harris stepped in, she was good enough. Democrats and Never Trumpers had said it time and again. They just wanted someone healthy. Someone normal. Someone sane. Someone different. Someone not Biden, someone not Trump. Someone else.

I would vote for any functioning politician over Biden and Trump.

I would vote for that squirrel in that tree over Trump.

There’s no such thing as a perfect candidate.

The country needs to turn the page on tired, wacky, old men.

Harris is tolerable.

Maybe Harris will surprise us.

And surprise them she did.

On that sticky summer Sunday afternoon when Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race and endorsed his number two to be the Democratic nominee for president, no one, not even Harris herself, knew what was going to happen.

A collective derecho-sized sigh of relief rose up from Democrats coast to coast, north to south, and every Blue enclave in between.

President Biden’s disastrous June debate performance had exposed the extent of his decline and put a glaring and unequivocal spotlight on his limitations as a candidate and as a prospective second-term president. Democratic voters and staunch party loyalists, Trump detractors, Trump loathers, and Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers had all feared the worst: They were stuck with an acuity-compromised octogenarian who could not deliver the votes and would surely lose the election. And then, their unthinkable, impossible nightmare would occur—Donald Trump would return to the White House.

After several weeks of party pressure and serpentine political machinations the likes of which have rarely been seen in this country, Biden agreed to withdraw his reelection bid. Bypassing a Democratic Party nomination fight, he handed the torch to Harris. In a statement, Biden asserted that bringing in Harris as his vice president was "the best decision I’ve made," and offered "my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year."

"Democrats," he added, "it’s time to come together and beat Trump."

This vigorous affirmation was standard but phony. Biden and his team, even members of the vice president’s office, had long thought Harris was not yet prepared to be president, and would be a weak candidate against Trump, maybe a doomed one. Some White House staff clung to the belief that Biden, with all his visible infirmity, remained the less risky option. Regarding their long-held view of Harris, they were as certain as they were worried.

Once Harris accepted the mantle from Biden, she seemingly became a political supernova overnight. She expanded, she leaned in, she improved. She showed charm and grit, confidence and swagger, grace and guts. She was, for the imperatives of the moment, great.

Democrats, once despondent over candidate Biden, now cheered as loudly as they had exhaled. The Dominant Media was euphoric—a fantastic story to cover, a Democratic heroine to bolster. The newspaper headlines and cable pontification surged beyond mere hagiography and well into farce. The blinders were firmly in place. The buzz words of summer were vibe shift and joy, and, of course, brat.

Harris chose a running mate lickety-split, selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after a drastically abbreviated vetting process, and pulled off a strong convention in Chicago, which managed to be both dignified and buoyant. Harris was in command. Her polls were competitive, her fundraising boffo.

But vibes can’t sustain a presidential campaign, and supernovas, no matter how luminous and intense the explosion, fade within a few weeks. When the glow dissipated, voters were left with the same Kamala Harris they had before, the same Kamala Harris that always had been, the one about whom there were substantial doubts in her own camp.

That Kamala Harris had no clear theory of the case for winning the race or governing, nor tested presidential-level skills. Reality set in. She began to stall.

By Labor Day, the brat summer had largely evaporated. The mood shift, it turned out, was not a national phenomenon at all, but rather a instinctive and manic reaction from the Democratic base.

By Labor Day, the brat summer had largely evaporated. The mood shift, it turned out, was not a national phenomenon at all, but rather a instinctive and manic reaction from the Democratic base.

Independents, double haters, and undecided voters, meanwhile, had taken a pause and paid attention, waiting to learn more about Harris’ positions and policy plans. But Harris didn’t set forth a rationale for her presidency, beyond blocking a second Trump term. By Labor Day, Harris had not challenged herself by sitting for a tough interview, nor offered consistent straight answers about her intentions once in office, nor reached out to Red America. She had not risked the customary "What my party has gotten wrong" concession on anything, eschewing a way to show boldness and political self-awareness which every elected president since Bill Clinton had made a core part of their pitch.

Harris supporters enjoyed a fresh burst of adrenaline on Sept. 9 when Harris and Trump faced off in the presidential debate. Harris was performatively strong, but the debate ironically only highlighted her fundamental problem. She looked and sounded good, appeared relaxed and unflinching, and brilliantly manipulated Trump’s ego, but in front of a huge audience of engaged citizens, she neglected to hammer any hard facts or clarify her own agenda. It was a chillingly short-sighted example of style over substance, and an egregious wasted opportunity.

It was time for Harris to stop coasting on vibes and parables and start doing the work.

But could she?

Her professional history indicated that the arduous task of crafting a message and headlining a full-blown campaign might be an uphill climb. Biden and many White House operatives still feared Harris could not beat Trump, and their failed efforts to prepare her both for the presidency and the race remained still fresh in their minds.

Even those with short memories know that Harris had not in the past shown she was adept at assembling the basic building blocks of a viable national candidacy. During her extensive and prominent career in California, Harris made as many foes as friends, with a significant number of local Democrats, both political operatives and regular citizens, declining to support her enthusiastically or, in some cases, under any circumstances.

Nor had Harris been a particularly distinguished or popular member of the Senate, unable to impress many colleagues on either side of the aisle. Indeed, some of her biggest detractors to date have been fellow senators who worked with her in the Capitol, although to be fair, she barely had time to establish herself in the position before moving out and up to the vice presidency.

The presidential bid she launched in January 2019 ended before the year was up; she failed to convey a winning message or gain any traction, and she ran out of money before a single ballot was cast. Postmortems on her campaign emphasized her apparent lack of decisiveness, authenticity, direction, and guiding principles.

CNN DATA EXPERT SAYS HARRIS' MOMENTUM HAS ‘STALLED’ WHILE TRUMP IS MORE POPULAR THAN IN PAST ELECTIONS

The various criticisms that have threaded throughout Harris’ professional rise are intertwined with the weak filaments of her current campaign. For most of the fall, it has been difficult for her to drive a message. She has struggled to produce a winning soundbite from an interview or rally. Despite a freshly honed oratorical style, Harris has been too vague and cautious in her rhetoric to spark a crystallizing moment, a revelation of the soul. Her travel schedule for almost the entirety of the campaign has been curiously light, with few rallies, no coast-to-coast blitzes, and a lack of interconnection within her organization, the calendar and the polls.

The feeling remains strong, even among some Democrats who desperately want her to win, that the Harris who was on offer before her ascendancy to the nomination is the one too often on display now. These Democrats see someone who is living in the moment rather than rising to the occasion.

If Harris loses on Nov. 5, it should be no surprise to anyone who has watched her political path these past several decades. The signs were all there.

However, if Harris triumphs, sending Donald Trump once and for all into political retirement, at this point, it will be something somewhat short of a shock.

With less than three weeks to go, Harris is demonstrating new signs of life, hitting her stride and having more fun. Her latest anti-Trump tagline—unhinged, unstable, and unchecked—seems to have some resonance. She is emitting refreshing flashes of authenticity, as she pivots from something in which her heart seems divided (shredding her previously held liberal positions) to something she relishes (cheeky denunciations of Trump’s fitness for office).

Democrats are fired up, and the country is primed for a reset. Harris has millions of supporters who are champing to vote for her, and not merely because they dislike Trump, or want to cast a ballot for a woman, or are true-blue Democrats. These citizens are voting for Harris herself now, because they have an appreciation for her accomplishments. Harris’ resume has always been solid and hard-earned—one must demonstrate true skill, stamina, and determination to become a United States senator and vice president. Despite the odd confluence of events that presented her with the Democratic nomination, Harris is now holding her own, in it to be sure, and with the potential to win it.

Even as the country hurtles towards Election Day, Harris still has time to meld her summer vibes with the steely gladiator focus that was on display this past week. Going up against Trump, one of the most formidable, most original, most agile campaigners of the modern era, is no simple feat. Among every other variable at issue in presidential campaigns, candidate quality matters a lot, perhaps most of all.

And no one ever said that winning the White House would be easy, even for a candidate – especially for a candidate, perhaps – who was given her party’s nomination without a fight.
Former President Trump echoed Ronald Reagan on Saturday during a spirited battleground outdoor rally at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, asking, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"

Trump blasted the Biden-Harris administration right off the bat, calling the current White House a "nightmare of inflation, invasion, and humiliation."

The Republican presidential nominee also commented on his attendance at the Catholic Charities' Al Smith Dinner on Friday night, where Vice President Kamala Harris was noticeably absent.

FORMER NFL STAR ANTONIO BROWN SLAMS HARRIS, SAYS 'TAMPON TIM' WALZ WASN'T A REAL FOOTBALL COACH AT TRUMP RALLY

Trump recalled, "she's the only one in years, decades that didn't show up. She didn't show up."

"And [Harris] ended up doing a tape that was pathetic," said Trump. "And it was an insult to Catholics, frankly, because she was actually sort of knocking them or knocking religion that she had the other event the other day where she said, you're in the wrong location when they started talking about a certain subject right here in the which basically was a knock on Christianity and a knock on religion, because she doesn't know what the hell she's saying."

Trump was joined by a slate of speakers during Saturday night's rally, including former NFL star wide receiver Antonio Brown.

"I want to say I know the media is going to call me crazy, me and Trump crazy for having me speak here," Brown said. "But I want to make this clear. We are not. They are."

BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR SAYS WALL STREET 'VERY CONVINCED' TRUMP WILL WIN 2024 ELECTION

The crowd was both large and optimistic, with many children present at the rally dressed up as the former president and local steelworkers wearing hard hats.

Trump opened his nearly two-hour stump with a tribute to his late friend and PGA golf legend Arnold Palmer.

"But there was nobody that had his magic. He was a thriller. He was unbelievable. He, he knew how to win and he knew how to,, just do whatever it was that electrified a crowd," Trump said. "If I had him here right now with me, this crowd would be going absolutely crazy. They'd say, Trump, get off this stage. We want Arnold Palmer to speak."

Trump said he was good friends with and named one of the villas on his Doral, Florida, property after Palmer, who was a native of Pennsylvania, and died in 2016.

Trump focused much of his energy and attention on the Keystone State, especially on manufacturing jobs.

"For most of American history, Pennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States. But year after year, globalist radical left politicians and incompetents like Kamala Harris have waged a war on your Commonwealth," Trump said.

"They've annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and foreign nations all over the world. Under the Trump administration, we are going to take back what is ours," he said.

Pennsylvania rank-and-file steelworkers with the Mon Valley Works union were welcomed onstage by Trump, who offered him a commemorative hard hat.

"The president saved the steel industry with tariffs, you saved it with tariffs," said a steelworker. "And you're my hero, and you're the greatest president ever. We love you. So steelworkers for Trump and the rank-and-file Mon Valley Works wanted to endorse you."

Trump plans on introducing a "Built in America" policy should he win in November, which would bring more manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania and the country at-large.

"So if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing, right? And starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris's war on Pennsylvania energy. Because, you know, she's going to ban you know, she's going to ban fracking, right? 100%," Trump said.

"You know, she was against fracking, against all this stuff. And then all of a sudden, about a year and a half ago, when she was getting killed in the polls, she said, I like fracking very much," he added.

According to a late September Fox News Poll, 60% of Pennsylvanians who are registered voters support fracking.

"Pennsylvania, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote," Trump said. "You have to go and vote. Get everybody you can."

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk is on a campaign trail blitz as he rallies support for former President Trump, targeting government regulations as he champions the expansion of American businesses and cutting government red tape.

Musk officially endorsed Trump over the summer, when the 45th president survived the first assassination attempt on his life this election cycle, and has since joined the campaign trail in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania to rally support and encourage people to vote. Relying on his decades as a tech visionary and business leader who has personally dealt with tight government regulations, Musk has made cutting red tape a hallmark of his stump speeches and commentary on X.

Early Sunday morning, Musk posted on X that he was ready to reveal to the public a bizarre alleged scheme where his company SpaceX was "forced by the government to kidnap seals."

"Tomorrow, I will tell the story of how SpaceX was forced by the government to kidnap seals, put earphones on them and play sonic boom sounds to see if they seemed upset," Musk posted on Sunday morning.

FETTERMAN ISSUES WARNING TO DEMOCRATS AFTER ELON STUMPS FOR TRUMP IN PENNSYLVANIA

Musk's tease came in response to a clip of him saying on Saturday in Pennsylvania that he has a "bunch of nutty stories" related to government overregulation, including how SpaceX had to study the probability of its Starship rocket hitting a whale or shark.

"SpaceX had to do this study to see if Starship would hit a shark. And I'm like... it's a big ocean. There are a lot of sharks. It’s not impossible, but it’s very unlikely. So we said, 'Fine, we’ll do the analysis. Can you give us the shark data?'" he recounted to laughters from the audience. He said the National Marine Fisheries Service ordered SpaceX to carry out the study.

"They were like, 'No, we can’t give you the shark data.' Well, then, OK, we’re in a bit of a quandary. How do we solve this shark probability issue? They said, 'Well, we could give it to our western division, but we don’t trust them.' I’m like, ‘Am I in a comedy sketch here?'" Musk said in the clip.

"Eventually, we got the data and could run the analysis to say, 'Yeah, the sharks are going to be fine.' But they wouldn’t let us proceed with the launch until we did this crazy shark analysis. Then we thought, 'OK, now we’re done.' But then they said, 'What about whales?'" Musk continued.

If re-elected to the White House, Trump said Musk could take a new position as "Secretary of Cost-Cutting" for the federal government.

"He doesn't want to be in the Cabinet," Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo last week on "Sunday Morning Futures." "He just wants to be in charge of cost-cutting."

"We'll have a new position: Secretary of Cost-Cutting. Elon wants to do that, and we have incredible people. He's running a big business. He can't just say, 'I think I'll go into the Cabinet.' Other people can. He can't, but Elon's a little bit different in that sense."

Going back to August, when Musk hosted Trump for an interview on X Spaces, he focused his economic criticisms on government overspending as spurring current inflation woes that have rocked Americans' pocketbooks.

FETTERMAN ADMITS ELON MUSK ‘ATTRACTIVE TO A DEMOGRAPHIC’ DEMOCRATS ‘NEED’ TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA

"A lot of people just don’t understand where inflation comes from. Inflation comes from government overspending because the checks never bounce when it’s written by the government. So if the government spends far more than it brings in, that increases the money supply. If the money supply increases faster than the rate of goods and services, that’s inflation," Musk said during their conversation.

"So really we need to reduce our government spending, and we need to re-examine… I think we need a government efficiency commission to say like, ‘Hey, where are we spending money that’s sensible. Where is it not sensible?’"

Musk officially hit the campaign trail on behalf of Trump's candidacy last week, holding a handful of rallies in Pennsylvania – a place Musk said he knows well, citing his Philadelphia residency while attending the University of Pennsylvania in the 1990s.

While speaking before an audience in Folsom last week, which is located about 20 miles outside of Philadelphia, Musk highlighted how Space X faced a $140,000 fine from the EPA for using drinking water to cool down a launch pad.

"I’ll tell you like a crazy thing, like we got fined $140,000 by the EPA for dumping fresh water on the ground. Drinking water. It’s crazy. I’ll just give you an example of just how crazy it is. And we’re like, ‘Well, we’re using water to cool the launch pad during launch. You know, we’re going to cool the launch pad so it doesn’t overheat. And in excess of caution, we actually brought in drinking water, so clean, super clean water,’" Musk said to the audience.

"And the FAA said, ‘No, you have to pay a $140,000 fine.’ And we’re like, ‘But Starbase is in a tropical thunderstorm area. Sky water falls all the time,’" Musk recounted, referring to SpaceX's headquarters in Texas. "'That is the same as the water we used' So, and it’s like… there’s no harm to anything. And they said, ‘Yeah, but we didn’t have a permit.’ We’re like, ‘You need a permit for fresh water?’" Musk recounted.

TRUMP SUPPORTER ELON MUSK OFFERS MASSIVE HOURLY PAY TO THOSE WORKING TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT

Musk argued that America needs to move from "solving one problem after another," to building industries that "inspire" residents alongside growing innovation, but that "we’re being massively slowed down by regulatory molasses."

Musk's campaign tour has apparently worried Democrats amid Trump's effort to claim the Keystone State.

Pennsylvania is viewed as the state that will likely determine the final outcome of the election, with both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly zigzagging the state to rally support among city dwellers, suburbanites and farmers alike. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman warned party members to not discount Musk's influence among Pennsylvania voters.

"Not even just that he has endorsed [Trump], but the fact that now he’s becoming an active participant and showing up and doing rallies and things like that," Fetterman told the New York Post, explaining that the enormously successful Tesla and SpaceX CEO is an attractive figure for the kinds of voters Harris needs to win.

"I mean, [Musk] is incredibly successful, and, you know, I think some people would see him as, like, a Tony Stark," said Fetterman, referencing the popular Marvel Comics character. "Democrats, you know, kind of make light of it, or they make fun of him jumping up and down and things like that. And I would just say that they are doing that at our peril."

Several Black male celebrities have announced their support for the Republican presidential nominee, former President Trump.

With only a few weeks until election day, the Harris campaign sees itself struggling with Black men as Trump is making gains with the group who are traditionally some of the Democratic Party's most reliable supporters.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released last week, Harris currently holds 78% of the Black vote, which is down from 2020, when President Biden won approximately 90% of that voting bloc. It's also down from 2016, when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote. Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly, according to the report: 70% said they would vote for Harris in November, down from Biden’s 85% in 2020.

Per an NCAAP survey, one in four Black men under 50 said they would support Trump in 2024.

While Harris has made numerous attempts to gain support from men and Black America , male commentators from radio host Charlamagne Tha God to comedic actor Eddie Griffin have warned that it may not work and that Trump himself has a unique appeal to Black men.

HARRIS RAMPS UP OUTREACH TO BLACK MALE VOTERS AS POLLS SUGGEST TRUMP MAKING GAINS

During this campaign, Trump has garnered the support of several notable Black male entertainers and athletes.

Lord Jamar

One of the members of the hip-hop group Brand Nubian, Lord Jamar, recently came out supporting Trump in an interview.

Jamar, a rapper, producer, and actor from shows like "The Sopranos," slammed Harris and her supporters and applauded Trump’s leadership.

"This woman, to me, is not qualified to run, you know, a Dunkin' Donuts or a 7-Eleven, let alone the corporation that we call the United States of America," Jamar, a founding member of Brand Nubian, said in an interview with "The Art of Dialogue" last week.

"Let's keep it real a n---- like Trump. First of all, there was no wars when Trump was in - was the president, how about that? There was no wars going on while Trump was president. This mother------ was doing gangster s--- to n----- like in the Taliban showing them pictures of their house from a satellite," he said.

Jamar added that he is among many Black Americans "in the real world" that do not support Harris.

"Trust me the sentiment on the street in the real world is a lot of people are not f------ with this woman. They see right through her, and they're trying to blame it on Black men, but no, I see a lot of Black women that are not f------ with her neither."

Kodak Black

Bill K. Kapri, also known as Kodak Black, has been an ardent Trump supporter since the former president pardoned him in 2021. The 27-year-old rapper also made appearances at Trump’s campaign rallies as he bids for reelection in 2024.

Florida native Kodak also dropped a supportive song called Fivio Foreign that featured portions of Trump's past speeches.

The self-identified Haitian rapper seemed to be upset at Trump after the GOP presidential nominee echoed viral claims that migrants had been seen eating pets and animals at the last presidential debate.

"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats," Trump said during the second presidential debate in September. "They're eating the pets of the people that live there."

The remarks came after the influx of Haitian migrants into the small town of Springfield, Ohio, was brought into the spotlight.

"We ain’t voting for nothing," Kodak said. "I ain’t gonna lie, Haitians, we came too far, bro. We came too f--king far, homie... We ain’t taking no Haitian slander."

However, just days after Kodak’s remarks, the rapper attended a Trump rally in Uniondale, New York in September, taking photos with Trump supporters.

Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell

Former Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowlers Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell joined Trump onstage at a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

Brown, wearing.a red MAGA hat, shouted "Let’s vote for Trump! Let’s make some noise for the president!"

"Let’s go Trump, you already know, vote Trump, let’s go," Bell said

Brown proceeded to lead the crowd in a "Here we go Steelers" chant.

The ex-NFL player has been vocal about his support of Trump, frequently commenting about the GOP presidential nominee on X.

Brown, who left the Steelers in 2018 when he was traded to the Raiders, also frequently criticizes Harris.

Brown on Thursday posted on X about his appearance at the rally saying, "Time to help make real change."

Lawrence Taylor

New York Giants legend Lawrence Taylor spoke at a Trump campaign rally in Wildwood, N.J., on May 11.

Taylor, speaking in front of 40,000 people on the Jersey shore, talked about how he left the Democratic Party.

"I grew up a Democrat, and I've always been a Democrat, until I met this man right here," Taylor said to cheers. "Nobody in my family ever will vote for a Democrat again."

L.T. is widely regarded as the best linebacker to ever play in the NFL.

Herschel Walker

Former NFL running back Herschell Walker is another well-known backer of Trump.

Walker is a former all-American football running back who played in the NFL for 12 seasons. Prior to that, he played for the upstart USFL league that intended to compete with the NFL. Trump was an investor in the league and the owner of the league's New Jersey Generals franchise that Walker played for.

In 2022, Walker won the Republican Senate nomination in Georgia by an overwhelming majority of the vote after receiving the endorsement of Trump, but went on to lose the general election to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.

Walker recently spoke out against former President Obama for his recent criticisms towards Black men not supporting Kamala Harris.

Don King

Trump’s campaign team posted a video on Instagram of famous and legendary boxing promoter Don King endorsing Trump.

"Get re-elected," Cleveland native King said. "And we must re-elect him to save ourselves. You know, a vote for Trump is a vote for yourself."

King went on to say, "Because we have to fight the system of lies and the creation of wrong being right and right being wrong … that’s got to be eliminated. And the only one who has the intestinal fortitude to be able to stand up and fight the system like it should be fought."

Now a South Florida resident, King, 93, promoted two of Muhammad Ali's greatest boxing fights, the "Rumble in the Jungle" and the "Thrilla in Manila," throughout his illustrious career.

He joined Trump on the campaign trail in 2016.

Mike Tyson

Prolific boxer Mike Tyson’s support of Trump dates back to his first 2016 campaign that led to his presidency.

His most recent comments on the election regarding Trump were favorable to the GOP presidential nominee.

"Trump is going to win," Tyson said September 20 on the "It Is What It Is" podcast starring former rappers Mase and Cam'ron.

"Is that who you want to win?" podcast co-host Cam'ron asked.

"Yeah, it'd be nice if he wins, yeah," Tyson replied. He continued, "I have my reasons [for wanting him to win]... He is just a good man. Listen, I don't agree with all his s--t. Nobody agrees with all my s--t, but you know, they [are] good people. No one is perfect in this world. Everybody got their s--t, you know."

Mase, a rapper turned preacher, said that he is "conservative" and "probably on the side of Trump."

During the early days of Tyson’s boxing career, he used to box at billionaire Trump's hotels.

50 Cent

Curtis James Jackson III, also known as 50 Cent, although he had not endorsed Trump, explained why people like him are gravitating toward the GOP candidate after his reaction to the first assassination attempt.

When Jackson was asked what his stance was on the 2024 election in an interview to discuss his new book "The Accomplice," Jackson replied "I’d like to stay out of it."

Jackson added that he related to Trump when the former president raised his fist after getting shot in the now iconic image.

"He says fight. All right. And that’s exactly what I did after I got shot. I just went into fight mode," he said. "People identify with it that way."

50 Cent had previously entertained the idea of supporting Trump in the past. Jackson in June told CBS News congressional correspondent Nikole Killion that he believed Black men were "identifying with Trump" because "they've got RICO charges [too]."
Former President Donald Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Sirius XM that his rally at Madison Square Garden next weekend sold out in mere hours.

Trump joined Breitbart News Washinton Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle for a 25-minute-long special report interview Saturday. When asked what Americans can expect at Sunday’s rally in the Big Apple, Trump emphasized that it will be a sold-out event.

LISTEN:

Breitbart · Fmr. President Donald J. Trump – October 19, 2024

“We sold it out in less than three hours. But people are going to come anyway. We have big screens outside. It’s going to be unbelievable. So come anyway. I mean, come, maybe you get in, I don’t know, but it sold out very quickly,” Trump said. “It’s fantastic. It’s going to be fantastic.”

Madison Square Garden has a vibrant history with American sports, entertainment, and politics. It was the sight of the “Fight of the Century” between Muhammid Ali and Joe Frazier in March 1971, the historic game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, and the 1994 New York Rangers’ Stanley Cup victory.

Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and the Rolling Stones are some of the music titans who have graced the new Garden with their talents, while it has hosted several Democrat National Conventions and one Republican National Convention in 2004. And, of course, the old Madison Square Garden, which closed in 1968, was where Marilyn Monroe sang the most memorable iteration of “Happy Birthday” in world history to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.

Trump first told Breitbart News back in December 2023 that he was considering renting the Garden for a rally.

“I may rent Madison Square Garden, and that’s the belly of the beast, right?” he said.

And while Trump looks forward to a magical night on New York’s biggest stage, he has plenty of other big rallies in store, including Saturday in Pennsylvania.
A handful of bettors are putting up millions of dollars on former President Donald Trump winning the election, skewing what some consider a metric for predicting the election massively to one side.

The users “Fredi9999,” “Theo4,” “PrincessCaro” and “Michie” make up $26 million in bets for Trump on popular betting site Polymarket, The Wall Street Journal first discovered Friday. Currently, Polymarket predicts that Trump has a 60% chance of winning the 2024 election, compared to only a 39.8% chance of Vice President Kamala Harris winning, a massive difference from the comparatively even odds predicted around October.

Some people, such as billionaire and Trump supporter Elon Musk, see the betting markets as a reflection of the reality of the election more than the polls. Experts are still divided on whether staking real money makes betting markets more accurate than polling, according to Fortune Friday. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: RNC Recruited Hundreds Of Thousands Of Volunteers, Thousands Of Lawyers To Ensure Election Integrity)

“Unlike polls, prediction markets can be influenced by the interests of a small number of large players, as appears to be happening [on Polymarket],” Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at the public affairs consultancy Think Big, told Fortune. “The limitation here is that prediction markets often attract a specific kind of participant: people interested in betting who might not reflect the broader population and they can be influenced by deep pockets, overconfident individuals or herd mentality.”

On Polymarket, people can buy “shares” on what they think is the most likely outcome of the election, with rise and fall depending on demand, according to Fortune. Nicholas Creel, an associate professor of business law at Georgia College & State University told Fortune that Polymarket attracts a certain type of person and leaves out the general population.

“In Polymarket in particular, you don’t have a particularly large or diverse crowd of people,” Creel said. “A large driver of this is that the exchange requires users to bet with cryptocurrency, which the vast majority of the population has little to no familiarity with. Cryptocurrency tends to be something mostly loved by those on the far right, particularly your libertarian types.”

Some experts even think that the sway in odds on the betting platform is part of a broader operation to boost Trump’s favorability.

“I believe there has been a coordinated effort to change the perception of this race,” Tom Bonier, senior adviser at research firm TargetSmart, told Fortune. “A central argument has emerged in the closing weeks of this campaign: strength versus weakness. Donald Trump’s persona, and therefore his support from voters, relies on being seen as strong. But if the public perception is that he will lose, that all falls apart.”

Polymarket did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Pennsylvania Democrat Party has seen a more than 100 percent increase in people leaving the party compared to the year before, according to recent voter registration data.

Recent voter registration data showed that as of October 14, there were roughly 3,958,835 registered Democrats, and roughly 3,646,110 registered Republicans in the state, according to Newsweek.

The data also showed that over the course of the year, 113,063 registered Democrats had left the party, compared to 2023, when 55,662 registered Democrats left the party in Pennsylvania. This represented a 103 percent increase.

Data found that over the course of 2024, 51,937 people switched from being registered Democrats to “other,” while 61,126 switched to the Republican Party.

In comparison, during 2023, voter registration data found that 19,321 switched from the Democrat Party to “other,” while 36,341 switched to the Republican Party, according to the outlet.

The recent voter registration data comes as Republicans in Pennsylvania have been making huge strides in registering more people with their party.

Data compiled by Decision Desk HQ’s Michael Pruser found that during September, Republicans in the state registered more than 60,710 people with the party, while 35,854 people had been registered with the Democrat Party.

Pennsylvania voter registration data has also found that five states that had previously leaned Democrat had switched to a Republican majority. The counties included; Berks County, Beaver County, Bucks County, Fayette County, and Luzerne County.

While Pennsylvania was crucial in President Joe Biden’s victory over former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, “Latino political and business leaders” in the state have reportedly expressed concerns that Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling with Latino support in the state, particularly among men, several sources told Politico.
President Joe Biden’s legacy on national security and foreign policy will leave significant problems for a future Donald Trump or Kamala Harris administration, with no easy or quick fixes in sight.

Under Biden’s tenure, wars have broken out across the Middle East and Europe, and tensions with American adversaries such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran — informally known as the “Axis of Evil” — have risen dramatically. Headed for the exit, Biden officials are making a series of moves to try to quell global tensions, but it likely won’t be enough to resolve glaring issues that either Trump or Harris will have to inherit in January, depending on which candidate wins the presidency. (RELATED: US Boots Hit Ground In Israel As Threat From Iran Looms)

“[Biden’s has] been a terrifically active foreign policy presidency, in the sense that there’s been a lot of fires burning in various regions of the world that the U.S. has ineffectually managed. I think that Biden’s legacy will be one of a sort of helpless giant,” Justin Logan, CATO Institute director of defense and foreign policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The next administration, whether it’s Harris or Trump, is going to have an awful lot of fires to put out.”

The Biden-Harris administration has toiled relentlessly to quell the ongoing war currently engulfing parts of the Middle East, which involves a conflict between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Syria and Iraq-based terror networks, and Iran. The initial conflict started between Israel and Hamas — which invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and killed 1,200 people — but has since evolved into a broader regional dilemma that the administration has had little ability to control or manage.

Biden officials have put various ceasefire proposals forward but none of the actors involved have accepted them. Diplomatic attempts have also failed to ease tensions or convince Israel or Iran and its terror proxies to curtail the conflict; Israel is expected to directly strike Iran in the coming days out of retaliation for an Iranian attack in early October.

Behind closed doors, Biden officials reportedly believe there is virtually zero chance the region will calm down between now and January, a sentiment seemingly shared by some of the U.S.’ Arab partners.

“There’s no chance now of it happening,” an Arab official told The Wall Street Journal in September of a possible Israel-Hamas ceasefire. “Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.”

Iran is a key player in the conflict as the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, using its cash reserves to fund various extremist groups in the Middle East. The Biden administration has eased sanctions against Iran in the last three years in the hopes of creating some sort of diplomatic ties with Tehran; this has seemingly failed as the country is no less hostile than before Biden took office, and has raked in billions of dollars under sanctions relief which subsequently gets distributed through its terror network.

Some of these funds have been used to advance Iran’s nuclear program, which has raised serious fears among the Western world that the regime will eventually create a nuclear weapon. (RELATED: Russian ‘Merchant Of Death’ Back In Arms Game, Selling To Terrorists After Being Freed Under Biden Admin: REPORT)

So fast has Iran’s nuclear program accelerated that it would be difficult to stop at this point, even if Trump won and reinstalled his “maximum pressure” campaign against the regime.

“The most dangerous situation is probably the specter of a nuclear Iran, which has grown exponentially during the Biden term,” Victoria Coates, senior executive at the Heritage Foundation and former White House national security adviser, told the DCNF. “This development makes the Iran file considerably more challenging than it was four years ago, and by the time President Trump would take office may well be hard to fully reverse.”

Elsewhere, Biden officials are struggling to maneuver the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has dragged on for two years and shown no signs of stopping. Though hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost in the fighting, neither side has made any significant territorial gains or moved the needle any closer to victory.

Billions in U.S. aid have done little more than provide Ukraine with enough defense to hold Russian forces back, and some lawmakers and critics have become worried that the Biden-Harris administration and Ukraine don’t have a strategy to end the war.

“[Russian President Vladimir Putin] saw an opportunity in Ukraine, and he saw the reluctance of the Biden administration wanting to engage and to lead on the world stage. And so I think he saw an opportunity to take Ukraine,” Morgan Viña, a former Department of Defense official and adviser to Ambassador Nikki Haley, told the DCNF.

“The U.S. has definitely supported Ukraine and made it possible for them to hold off Russia. But this war would be over had the U.S. given Ukraine the capabilities to win,” Viña said. “Because of Biden’s reluctance to give Ukraine those tools, we see this prolonged conflict.”

The two wars only account for some of the global problems to spring up under Biden’s tenure. The Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with China — which is rapidly advancing its military capabilities — has been incredibly fraught over the last three years, and the administration has failed to stop Beijing from a swath of espionage activities that have found their way inside the U.S.’ own borders. (RELATED: World’s Largest State Sponsor Of Terrorism Sets Sights On New Goal: Become A Vacation Destination)

China has its eyes locked on Taiwan, which it has threatened to bring back into the Chinese Communist Party whether peacefully or by force. Chinese forces in the Taiwan Strait have become increasingly aggressive in recent years, routinely staging invasion drills and simulating blockades around the island.

And while the Trump administration made historic progress in establishing diplomatic inroads with North Korea, those efforts have crumbled under the current administration. North Korea has gone further into isolation and continued building its already considerable nuclear stockpile in recent years.

There’s little chance all of these problems are even partially resolved between now and the time Biden leaves office, Viña told the DCNF.

“I think if anything, we’re going to see potential escalation. Biden is a lame duck president at this point, and he’s been a lame duck since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee,” Vina said. “He wasn’t taken seriously before by our adversaries — and many of our friends for that matter. He sure as hell isn’t being taken seriously now … I just don’t think Biden is well placed to have any sort of credibility at this point in time.”

That means it will be either on Trump or Harris to pick up the mantle and try to address some of these problems. Both Trump and Harris bring different experience to the table and different methods to navigate the conflict.

Trump’s “America First” branded style of policy would take a much different course of action than Harris’, experts told the DCNF. Trump has vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war between the time of the election and his inauguration — relying on his relationships with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin to do so — help restore peace to the Middle East, impose tougher pressure on Iran, rebuild relations with North Korea and take a competitive approach to China, specifically on trade relations.

“This sorry state of affairs can be quickly righted with clear and decisive U.S. leadership, which former President Trump has demonstrated,” Coates told the DCNF, pointing to Trump’s record during his first term as president. (RELATED: ‘Strategic Disaster’: UK Gives Up Islands Holding Secret US Military Base)

Logan noted that some of Trump’s goals may be difficult to achieve, such as ending the Russia-Ukraine war within a matter of months. Trump has previously said he would end the war in just 24 hours’ time.

“Trump is a little bit different because you get a lot of unfalsifiable statements. ‘The Russians would never have invaded Ukraine had I been President’ — wonderful if true, but as to why or how, the precise mechanisms don’t present themselves,” Logan said. “Trump says he would bring the conflict in Ukraine to a close within 24 hours. How, we don’t know.”

On the other side, Harris’ foreign policy experience seems minimal and she’d likely have to rely considerably on her advisers in shaping her policy platform. She has also seemingly demonstrated a lack of basic knowledge of key geopolitical issues, or at the very least, hasn’t shown that she’s familiar with them.

“I listen to Kamala Harris speak, and wind up with many more questions that I started out with,” Logan told the DCNF. “There’s an ethereal quality to her statements on foreign policy that make them inscrutable, to be honest.”

In her role as vice president, Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden’s foreign policies, and would likely carry most of them on in her four years as president.

Given that Biden’s approach has seemingly produced few positive results — or failed outright — the multiple current global conflicts and problems would likely grow significantly worse under Harris, according to experts.

“The Biden administration is leaving behind a fractured and conflicted world in which enemies and allies alike are deeply distrustful of American intentions and reliability,” Coates told the DCNF. “Harris has not demonstrated any intention to break with this disastrous legacy, so rather than picking up the pieces, she would be more likely to break more off.”

While Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump was the featured guest speaker at the 79th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City.

Hosted and chaired by Cardinal Timothy Dolan and emceed by comedian Jim Gaffigan, this year’s sold-out fundraiser brought together thousands of guests to raise money for charitable organizations serving New York’s most vulnerable.

“I would not miss the Al Smith Dinner for anything in the world. I still remember coming here as a very young guy with my father … ” Trump told the crowd. “It’s an honor to be here to support the city and the community. It’s a great community that I love. I’ve been here a long time, and I love it.”

Since its founding in 1946, the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation has raised millions of dollars to support nonprofit Catholic organizations in the Archdiocese of New York. Established by Francis Cardinal Spellman in honor of Catholic New York Gov. Alfred Emanuel Smith, the Foundation supports organizations providing education, health care services and family resources.

In 2023, a record $7.3 million was raised to help the poor, sick and underprivileged in New York. Catholic Charities, Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center, Sisters of Life and the Inner-City Scholarship Fund are among the numerous impactful organizations that the Foundation benefits and supports.

Last year, because of the Foundation’s help, 175 special needs children received assistance at school, more than 400 foster children received mental health treatments, 120 children were tutored weekly and 763 students attended Camp Veritas.

The annual dinner is a cherished opportunity for people with different backgrounds and beliefs to unite in support of helping those in need. Since 1960, presidential candidates of major parties during election years have taken a night off to attend the dinner, engage in some light-hearted banter, and bring attention to the many worthy causes the Foundation supports.

In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy were the first presidential candidates to appear and give remarks at the dinner together emphasizing the impact and legacy of Al Smith.

As Nixon said, “Al Smith is a man who is bigger than his party … because the ideals for which he stood were as big as America itself.”

This is what the Al Smith Dinner is all about – an evening of cordiality for a common cause that benefits Americans in need.

Apparently, that was too much to ask of Harris.

In a break with precedent, Harris declined the invitation to attend the Al Smith Dinner, the first presidential candidate to do so since Walter Mondale in 1984. Instead, she sent in a pre-recorded video message.

If there was any question about Harris’ priorities, consider that her campaign found time for an appearance on the vulgar “Call Her Daddy” podcast but not for a fundraiser benefiting impoverished children.

With each passing day, more Americans are reminded of Harris’s abysmal record targeting Catholics as California’s attorney general and U.S. senator, and as vice president of the United States. (RELATED: CALLISTA GINGRICH: The Realignment Of Catholic Voters To The GOP)

As attorney general, Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, calling on the court to force family-owned Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees.

Recall the vitriol with which Harris questioned Catholic judicial nominees as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris implied that affiliation with the Knight of Columbus – a Catholic charitable organization that included JFK among its members – was grounds for disqualification.

And during her tenure as Vice President, practicing Catholics have been suspected and accused of domestic terrorism and violent extremism.

It’s no wonder that 50 percent of Catholic voters in swing states support President Trump while just 45 percent support Vice President Harris.

Kamala Harris’s absence at the 79th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner is a reminder that she can’t hide her disdain for Catholics. It confirms what Catholic voters already know – Kamala Harris is the anti-Catholic candidate.

Americans must get out and vote and grab as many of their friends as possible and get them to follow suit, former President Donald Trump said during a SiriusXM Patriot Channel special on Saturday with Breitbart News’s Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle, deeming this the most important thing anyone can do leading up to the pivotal election.

“The biggest thing we want is for them to get out and vote. If they want, vote early. I mean, I feel both ways about it. A lot of people say vote early. The main thing is to vote,” Trump said. “Whether it’s early or whether it’s on Election Day. But the big thing is you got to get out and vote.”

“And the best thing they could do is get ten of their friends, or two of their friends, or as many as they can get, down to vote. We can’t take a chance on losing the country,” the former president continued.

“The Border Patrol gave me the strongest endorsement you’ve ever seen. You know that Border Patrol is a big deal because, again, I believe that immigration and the border is the biggest problem. I think that inflation and a horrible job they’ve done in the economy horrible. I mean, we lost last month, 50,000 manufacturing jobs. We’re losing jobs at a level — we’re not going to have any manufacturing by the time these people get finished. And she [Vice President Kamala Harris] has no idea. She wants to raise taxes for everybody. We’re going to have everybody either out of a job or leaving the country,” Trump warned.

“The companies are all going to leave the country because, you know, our taxing policy, whereas with me, they’re coming back in. So the biggest thing you can do is get out and vote and spread the word, because we’re going to make America great again, greater than ever before. And I hope they can watch my rally. It will be on the various stations, but watch it,” Trump continued, referencing his rally in Pennsylvania and reminding listeners if the intensity of his work schedule, as he has had no days off.

“So in 52 days I’ve been I haven’t taken a day off … and I don’t anticipate a day off, and we’re, I think we’re really doing a great job. But most importantly … it’s not the work. It is the work, to an extent, but not really the work. It’s the message: We have the best policy,” Trump said to voters.

“It’s cutting your taxes. It’s cutting regulations so that companies can breathe and hire a lot of people. All of these messages, right to try, you know, right to try with getting people medicines and things,” he said, also noting that his administration takes care of veterans.

“One other thing I would like to say is that four years ago, we were respected all over the world. We wouldn’t have had Ukraine. We wouldn’t have had October 7 with Israel. We wouldn’t have had any of these things that we have right now. We wouldn’t have had inflation. It was all caused by the stupid energy problems. And we’re going to bring that back,” Trump said, promising to bring energy costs down.

“From the time I get there, your energy will be reduced your bills by 50 percent because we have more liquid gold than anybody, any other nation — Saudi Arabia, Russia included, we have more than anybody,” Trump said, explaining that it will have a widespread effect, bringing down the cost of everything else such as groceries.

“It’s going to bring it down at levels that people are going to be surprised. So we’re going to do a real job, and we’re going to do something where we’re a country that’s respected again,” Trump vowed, noting that Vice President Kamala Harris’s real policies were seen when she was running against President Joe Biden in the 2020 primary.

“Her real policies are when she was campaigning, and she was campaigning against Biden, and she lost. She came in last. She was the first one to drop out with 22 people running. That’s the real Kamala, and she was a radical left lunatic, and now she’s trying to pretend she’s MAGA. That’s not working,” he said, circling back to his main point that everyone must get out and vote.

LISTEN:

“Most important is get out and vote, and bring some people with you. You have a lot of people that would vote if somebody asked them. We got to get them off that couch, right? We have to take the potato chips away from them, and we have to get them off the couch, Matt, all of us included, right?” Trump added.
EAGLE PASS, Texas — As a new surge at the border in the small town of Eagle Pass begins to grow, U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention buses are delivering migrants daily in larger numbers to a non-government shelter. Breitbart Texas drone footage shows one bus delivering nearly 50 migrants to the Mission Border Hope shelter on Friday. The group of migrants consisted of several family units and single adult migrants.

The shelter is currently housed in a new location, a 20,000-square-foot building that received up to 1,000 migrants or more from CBP daily during its peak operation in September and December of 2023. According to a source within CBP who is familiar with the daily migrant releases and operation of the shelter, more than 250,000 migrants have been released to the shelter during its operation.

The United Methodist Church operates the shelter using Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to provide food, shelter, and transportation away from the border for the migrants. According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, more than $13 million of FEMA Shelter and Services program funds have been obligated for use by the Mission Border Hope shelter in Eagle Pass under the Biden-Harris administration.

As reported by Breitbart Texas, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has bused more than 100,000 migrants from this shelter and others in Texas border cities to Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. On Friday, some migrants were being picked up by private vehicles outside the shelter while others were loaded on commercial conveyances for transportation to another shelter located in San Antonio, Texas. The network of federally funded shelters operates to move the migrants to other cities across the United States.

FEMA’s shelter and services program obligated more than $1 billion in federal funds in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 to reimburse the network of shelters across the United States for expenses related to migrants released at the southwest border.

As election day nears, the source within CBP, not authorized to speak to the media, says a noticeable increase in migrants, including Special Interest Aliens and unaccompanied migrant children, has appeared in the small border town in recent weeks. As reported by Breitbart Texas, a resurgence of large single migrant groups crossing into Eagle Pass occurred in late September.

In the previous seven days, nearly 160 unaccompanied migrant children were sent across the border into Eagle Pass by their parents or other family members. The unaccompanied migrant children, most between the ages of 5-17, hailed from several Central and South American countries, according to the source within Customs and Border Protection. On Wednesday, Texas Department of Public Safety Highway Patrol troopers interdicted 57 unaccompanied migrant children in a single group of more than two hundred migrants fording the river.

As reported by Breitbart Texas, the large groups crossing almost daily into the small Texas border town have included dozens of Special Interest Aliens from across the globe. The groups crossing into the city have been found to contain migrants from Iran, Egypt, Turkey, and several Western African countries.

The CBP source says the migrant increases are likely to continue and are expected to rise as the election grows closer.

“We are seeing an increase in the Special Interest Aliens and unaccompanied children,” the source stated. “These are demographics we have no way of returning. Absent any derogatory information discovered during processing, they will be released.” the source says.

According to CBP, nearly 250,000 migrant apprehensions have occurred in the Del Rio Sector of the Border Patrol. According to the source, almost 80 percent of all apprehensions within the sector occur within the city of Eagle Pass.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is warning fellow Democrats not to dismiss Elon Musk's support for former President Trump in the Keystone State.

Nineteen Electoral College votes are at stake in Pennsylvania on Nov. 5 and the state is rated a toss up by Fox News' Power Rankings.

With both Trump and Vice President Harris fiercely competing there, and the winner likely to take the White House, the plain-dressed and plainspoken Fetterman told the New York Post in an interview that "Musk is a concern."

"Not even just that he has endorsed [Trump], but the fact that now he’s becoming an active participant and showing up and doing rallies and things like that," Fetterman said, explaining that the enormously successful Tesla and SpaceX CEO is an attractive figure for the kinds of voters Harris needs to win.

"I mean, [Musk] is incredibly successful, and, you know, I think some people would see him as, like, a Tony Stark," said Fetterman, referencing the popular Marvel Comics character. "Democrats, you know, kind of make light of it, or they make fun of him jumping up and down and things like that. And I would just say that they are doing that at our peril."

Musk, the world's richest man, has described himself as a centrist and voted for Democrats in the past. He has since stated in various social media posts that the Democratic Party has drifted too leftward, embracing what he calls the "woke mind virus."

He appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, alongside Trump earlier this month, where he told a crowd of Trump supporters that this is the "most important election of our lifetime."

Musk also posted on X that he would be speaking at a series of town hall events in the battleground state through the weekend.

Additionally, the billionaire has put his money where his mouth is, donating $75 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, which focuses on voter turnout.

Fetterman, who at times has clashed with the progresive wing of his party, told the Post that while he is not in a panic over 2024, the election in Pennsylvania is "going to be ridiculously close."

"Trump has a connection that’s undeniable. And anyone that spends any time across Pennsylvania can see that kind of devotion and that’s why it’s going to be very close," Fetterman said, "Pennsylvania picks the president."

Fetterman had stood solidly behind President Biden while other Democrats sought to drive the president out of the 2024 race after his widely-panned debate performance against Trump in June. He maintains that Biden would be competitive with Trump had he not withdrawn.

"I’d like to remind everybody that Biden is the only person that’s ever beaten Trump," Fetterman said,

He described the effort to put Biden out to pasture as "a total blowtorch."

"You had the Democratic side, you have the ongoing, right wing media, and then the celebrities got involved in it as well, too. And then the New York Times became the, ‘he’s got to go’ outlet throughout all that as well."

Fetterman emphasized that he fully supports Harris now and believes she can win Pennsylvania.

"Harris could not have run a better campaign than she has so far right now," he told the Post.

EXCLUSIVE: Montana's U.S. Senate race has one of the most "intense" ground games of the 2024 cycle with the chamber majority hanging in the balance, according to the chairman of the Republican campaign arm.

Sen. Steve Daines is spearheading Republican efforts to take control of the Senate as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), with a heightened emphasis on ousting a three-term Democrat in red state Montana.

Daines exclusively told Fox News Digital the Montana Senate race pitting Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy against three-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester features one of the strongest ground game efforts from the GOP he has witnessed in the state.

"I've watched a lot of Montana Senate races, House races, governor races over the years. This is the most intense ground game operation and the most far-reaching that I've seen in many election cycles," Daines told Fox News Digital. "It's a door-to-door type of persuasion, as well as a lot of phoning, a lot of digital. So, it's a really strong ground game, knowing that I think well-run ground games win elections."

COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE BEING OFFERED THOUSANDS TO ENDORSE MONTANA SENATOR'S RE-ELECTION BID THROUGH NIL DEALS

The New York Times recently reported that Sheehy is leading Tester by eight percentage points, but Daines emphasized that while the Republican candidate remains ahead in several polls, they are going to continue energizing their get-out-the-vote efforts until Election Day.

"It's a very aggressive, active time with just a little over 2½ weeks until the election focused on voter turnout and ground game operations, as well as continuing to have the sufficient resources," Daines said. "Get the message out to those few undecided voters that are left, whether it's through television, radio, digital mail. So, we're not letting up. You keep working hard all the way until Election Day."

The Montana race figures to be the most expensive Senate race on a per-vote basis, which Daines attributes to its high stakes.

"This is what secures the majority for the Republicans and takes the gavel out of Chuck Schumer's hands," he told Fox. "And that's why there's so much focused attention on this race."

In early September, two political forecasters shifted the Montana race from a toss-up to "leans Republican," along with AARP and the NYT surveys showing the Republican leading the race against the three-term Democrat.

A visit to Bozeman by former President Trump in August, who endorsed Sheehy earlier this year, contributed to the recent polling shift in the Republican candidate's favor, according to the chairman.

KEY SENATOR REPORTEDLY BEHIND HARRIS' RISE IN POWER WITHHOLDS HIS ENDORSEMENT FOR PRESIDENT

The electorate in Montana has shifted toward the GOP over the years, and Tester remains the only Democrat to hold a statewide office in the state.

"I think what's happened is Montana, in terms of their voting and their thinking, has moved a bit more. But the biggest problem for the Democrats is they've moved so far left. This is not the same Democrat Party that I grew up with here in Montana," Daines said of the red wave in the state.

Daines also highlighted the national implications of the Big Sky Senate race.

"This race is bigger than Montana, because this race indeed will decide the future of the United States Supreme Court, the future of the circuit courts," Daines said. "There's also the Trump tax cuts that expire in '25, which would be a massive tax increase for Montana's small businesses.

"Jon Tester voted against that tax bill. I voted for it. Tim Sheehy would vote for that. So, there's just a lot at stake, not only for Montana but for the nation. And, so, we here in Montana will probably be able to flip the majority control of the U.S. Senate with Tim Sheehy's victory. And that has significant implications, not only for the great state of Montana, but for our great country."

There are 34 Senate seats up for grabs this cycle, and Democrats are protecting 23 of them. The Senate majority stands at 51-50 with Democrats in the majority, meaning just a one seat flip could shift the majority to the Republican Party.
"Real Time" host Bill Maher struck a much more worried tone Friday night after he confidently predicted that Vice President Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election.

"Democrats need to stop thinking that an October surprise is going to save us from another Trump term," Maher began his monologue. "Trump's superpower as a candidate is that he's been so constantly and ubiquitously awful for so long that it is simply no longer seen… If you're waiting for an October surprise to knock him out, dream on. There are better odds of another ‘Joker’ musical."

He noted some stumbles for Harris during her recent media blitz.

"This is Kamala's great dilemma," Maher later continued. "Trump is invulnerable to an October surprise, but she is very vulnerable because she's the one who is still undefined. And as she showed in this week's Bret Baier interview, her go-to when attacked for her own actions is usually ‘Trump is worse.’ Okay, we know that, but now undecided voters want to hear about you. They want someone to vote for."

BILL MAHER QUESTIONS MEDIA AVOIDING DOUG EMHOFF CONTROVERSIES: ‘WOULDN’T THAT MAKE IT LOOK WORSE?'

The HBO host summarized that Trump's coalition is made up of "people who really do like him" and people who think he's better than "far-left insanity."

"And the voters' big doubt about Kamala is – are you part of far-left insanity?" Maher asked. "The attack ad I see ten times a day, and a question Bret Baier aimed at her on Wednesday was about her saying in 2019 that she supported providing taxpayer funded sex change operations to illegal immigrants in prison, something that's actually never happened and has no real bearing on anybody's life. But it's a litmus test for voters out there who want to know of the Democrat – is there anything your fringe can suggest that will ever make you say, 'No, that's f---ing ridiculous?'"

MAHER SAYS ELECTION ‘NOT LOOKING THAT GREAT' FOR HARRIS, MOCKS NEED TO HAVE OBAMA ‘SCOLD’ BLACK MEN ON VOTING

Maher then turned to Harris' appearance on "The View" where she said "there's not a thing that comes to mind" that she would have done differently during the Biden presidency.

He called that response "no bueno."

"It's getting late early, and we can't afford any more bad answers like this one last week," Maher said. "Next time, maybe try 'Joe Biden generally did a good job, but sure, I wish we tightened the border sooner, as we have done now, and trust me, I learned my lesson, and that's never going to happen.'"

BILL MAHER SHOCKED BY MSNBC'S SOFTBALL KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW: I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE ‘RUBBING HER FEET’

He then made a direct plea to the Democratic nominee.

"Kamala, it's so important that you win this election, not just for the sake of retaining a real democracy and for the good of the world, but also because I predicted a month ago, you'd win this thing, and if you blow it, it's gonna make me look bad," Maher said, sparking laughs from the audience. "I've got a really good prediction record, so please don't f--k this up! Kamala, ever since I put down my marker on you and said you'd win and I wasn't even worried about it, everyone, everywhere on the road in LA texting me, emailing me, stopping me at restaurants, asking me, ‘Bill, are you sure?’ No, I'm not f---ing sure! Of course I'm not sure, but that's my gut!"

"I think Kamala Harris wants this. I think she can do this, to say nothing of if she loses, she'll never hear the end of it from Joe ‘I told you I was the only one who could beat him’ Biden," Maher added.

Maher previously predicted following last month's presidential debate that Harris had the election locked up.

"I'm gonna make this a very momentous night with a prediction," Maher said at the time. "Because I have the credibility for this prediction, because I had been called a ‘Trump alarmist’ for a very long time. They were wrong, I was right – he wasn't gonna leave power. But ever since then and since the [Access Hollywood] tape… and he survived that. Every time he's done crazy s--- and gotten himself in trouble, I said ‘No, no. It’s not over.'"

"Tonight I'm saying – I think it's over," Maher said, sparking cheers from his liberal audience.
A tombstone bearing the name of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who was nearly assassinated twice, was displayed in a New York City art gallery ahead of the 2024 election.

Brooklyn-based artist Brian Andrew Whiteley revived his 500-pound anti-Trump art project, the “Legacy Stone,” at the Satellite Gallery in Manhattan,” the New York Post reported.

Trump tombstone art project on display in NYC following assassination attempts https://t.co/NtXELPVdau pic.twitter.com/h6E6hxBHil — New York Post (@nypost) October 19, 2024

The phrase “Made America Hate Again” was chiseled toward the bottom of the tombstone. Trump’s birth year, 1946, was listed, but no death year has been included, photos of Whiteley’s creation show.

Celebratory leftists danced at the sight of Trump’s tombstone, the artist told the outlet.

“There’s been very happy people, celebratory people,” Whiteley said. “We just have people screaming, yes, yes, yes, dancing, taking photos of groups of people at a time with the tombstone, celebrating.”

Made from Vermont granite, the Trump tombstone sat beside heart-shaped flowers colored like the American flag, images show.

Originally created in May 2016, when Trump first ran for president, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) confiscated Whitley’s sculpture after a slew of concerned callers reached out to the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service, according to the outlet. The artist initially placed the stone in the Sheep Meadow in Central Park before law enforcement removed it, held it in a storage locker and returned it four months later.

Whitley claimed his Trump tombstone was not a call to violence and had more to do with the former president’s legacy. (RELATED: ‘As I Was Saying …’: Donald Trump Resumes Butler Rally Almost Three Months After Assassination Attempt)

“Honestly, it was about Trump and his ego … I felt like this was a way to foreshadow his own legacy, kind of like a Dickens’ Christmas Story, foreshadowing where his legacy could be,” Whiteley said.

However, Trump supporters and allies did not appreciate the artist’s morbid mockup.

“This so-called artist thinks this stunt is edgy, but it’s not. Edgy would be going to Iran with art to promote women’s rights at the doorstep of the Ayatollah. Instead, he’s displaying this tombstone after two assassination attempts on President Trump on top of the ongoing Iranian plots to kill him. This behavior is dangerous,” Republican Florida Rep. Mike Walz said of the exhibit.

Despite the attempts on Trump’s life, Whitley said, “I think we should kick his ass at the ballot box.”

More than one million voters have already cast a ballot in Georgia for the 2024 presidential election, according to Gabriel Sterling, chief deputy to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

Sterling made the announcement on Friday, on the fourth day of early voting in the Peach State.

“We have done it! We crossed the 1,000,000 voter mark at around 11:50am,” he announced, touting the “amazing turnout!”

“So happy for the counties and the voters! Let’s keep it going,” he urged:

The news comes as Georgia voters smashed records on the first day of early voting on Tuesday, as detailed by former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA).

“The prior record for day one voting was 136,000 — blew that away, over 300,000,” she said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily on Thursday. “After yesterday, it was 550,000 people [who] have voted.”

“So about ten percent of the state in the first two days,” she said, noting that the last day of early voting is typically the biggest day.

“But we’ve also broken that record,” Loeffler said, previewing what appears to be “unprecedented turnout for this election.”

The turnout coincides with the release of an ECU poll, showing Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in the Peach State by three percentage points. He garnered 49 percent to Harris’s 46 percent support:

More via ECU:

Overall, 52% of likely voters in Georgia have a very favorable or somewhat favorable opinion of Donald Trump compared to 46% who have a very favorable or somewhat favorable opinion of Kamala Harris. Additionally, 49% of likely voters in Georgia have a very favorable or somewhat favorable opinion of Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance, while 47% are very favorable or somewhat favorable toward Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz. Trump’s overall lead of three percentage points over Harris in Georgia comes from his strength among male voters. Although Harris leads Trump among women by eight percentage points, 52% to 44%, Trump holds a much larger lead among men of eighteen percentage points, 56% to 38%. Trump also performs well with seniors (65 and older) – a segment of the electorate in which he leads Harris by ten percentage points, 54% to 44%. By comparison, Harris leads Trump among young voters (18 to 29 years-olds), 50% to 41%. Voters in Georgia are further divided by education level. For those who hold a four-year college degree or more, Harris leads Trump, 53% to 39%. Among those without a four-year college degree, Trump leads Harris, 56% to 41%.

That survey was taken October 9-14, 2024, and has a +/- 4 percent margin of error.

Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Whatley said Friday on Breitbart News Daily that Republicans are “very happy” with what they are seeing in these early voting days in states such as Georgia and North Carolina, the latter of which saw Republicans with a “record first day turnout.”

“We are seeing very, very positive, upbeat results. We had a record first day turnout for Republicans in North Carolina yesterday, just landed in Georgia, and the numbers that we’ve seen from the first several days here — very, very positive,” Whatley said.

Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson said Friday on his podcast that he believes former President Donald Trump will defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

Polls between Trump and Harris have become a tug-of-war, with political pundits warning about the former president’s gains among key Democratic voting blocs. On “The Victor Davis Hanson Show,” Hanson expressed that the public’s overall judgment of Harris’ character will cause voters to stop supporting her.

“I think the time has run out now. Maybe she could have done this 90 days and had all these, and then she would have had some experience, but she’s tried every type of gymnastics now,” Hanson said. “It takes a while, though. I mean, people are very busy, they’re at work or they have their other interests, so they can’t watch TV, they can’t read the news, but they get enough clips over 90 days. Here and there, they’re driving to work [and] they hear a little bit.”

“They turn on the TV and they channel surf — they see a little bit. They go online, and a little news flash comes across their screen and it adds up. I think it’s now got to that summation, that people understand that she’s [not] there, she’s just an empty pants suit — she really is. I think she’s gonna lose, I really do,” Hanson added. “I don’t want to predict, I’m not a good predictor, but it could be what they call a close landslide where she loses by 40 or 50,000 votes but in all seven swing states.”

Hanson pointed to a national Marist poll released on Oct. 16, which showed Harris leading Trump by five points nationally. However, the data also showed Trump leading Harris by ten points among independent voters. (RELATED: Trump Leading Harris In All Major Swing-State Polling Averages As Campaign Hits Home Stretch)

WATCH:

“That’s what I don’t quite understand [about] the polls. You can’t have the independents going up for Trump, you can’t have blacks going up for Trump and the Latino profile going up and women staying the same — considerable lead for her — but then have the Marist poll go down for Trump, so he’s down by five. It just doesn’t make sense,” Hanson said.

“So it tells me that the pollsters, many of them, feel that they would rather sacrifice integrity and reputation and get her elected. And claim that they really didn’t mean it or like in 2016 — it was just an inadvertent error — but they’re using the polls to gin up support for,” Hanson continued. “I don’t think it’s working and it suggests that they might be really shocked. We might have Rachel Maddow in tears again on Election Eve.”

Both Harris and Trump have been back and forth within swing state polls, however, current averages from RealClearPolitics show Trump largely leading among the key states. Across seven of the key battleground states, Trump now has a 0.8-point lead, taking 48.3% support, with Harris slightly behind at 47.5%.

Nationally, Trump is still slightly behind Harris, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, with the vice president holding a 1.4-point lead over Trump. However, on Thursday, pollster Nate Silver released his updated prediction model, showing Trump holding a slight lead over Harris by more than half a percentage point.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Republican nominee Donald Trump is “more popular now” than he was in the 2016 and 2020 elections.

Trump’s current net favorability currently stands at -9 points, which is higher than his -27 net favorability rating in 2016 and -12 points in 2020, Enten said. The reporter added that the former president’s favorability is at the best it has ever been as Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum has stalled.

“Here’s the deal, if you believe that Donald Trump has somehow become less popular over time, let me change your mind about that. In fact, he is more popular at this point in the campaign than he was at this point in the 2020 campaign or the 2016 campaign,” Enten said. “Look, he’s still under water with a -9 point net favorability rating. But that is higher than he was in 2020 at -12 points when he nearly won, and that’s way higher than the -27 net favorability back in 2016 when he did win. So, I think there’s this real question in Kamala Harris’ mind, in the campaign’s mind, why is Trump more popular now than he was in 2020 and 2016.”

WATCH:

Harris’ popularity rose significantly once she launched her presidential candidacy on July 21, surging from -15 points on July 17 to -4 points on Aug. 17, Enten said. Her ratings have since dropped from +1 points in September to -1 points as of October 17. (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Trump Could Be In ‘Very Strong Position’ In Wisconsin)

“Kamala Harris had her popularity rising once of course she became the presumptive Democratic nominee,” Enten said. “Look, she was at -15 points back [on] July 17 and -4 point on August 17, then +1 points, she was actually in positive territory a month ago. But she has fallen back down to -1. The momentum of Kamala Harris has stalled, and I think they feel like they have to change something that’s going on in their campaign because they were seeing a rise and now it has stalled out.”

“Look, she’s still more popular than Trump, but look, Joe Biden was more popular than Trump, much more popular and barely won, and Hillary Clinton was much more popular than Donald Trump and lost. Being more popular than Trump isn’t enough, she has to continue seeing her favor-abilities rise, but in fact they’re going in the wrong direction,” Enten continued.

The former president is currently leading in every major swing state less than 20 days out from the election, RealClear polling averages found Friday. He holds a 0.8 point lead against Harris in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada.

Harris’ positivity rating dropped from 48% in September to 43% in October, while her negativity rating rose from 45% to 49%, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki pointed out Monday. Her 5-point lead against Trump in September turned into a deadlock tie of 48% to 48% in October.

The vice president’s polling averages in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are up by 1 point against Trump, which stands significantly lower than President Joe Biden’s 8-point lead ahead of the election, Enten pointed out Monday. Biden only narrowly won in these states, indicating that Harris’ 1-point lead may not be enough to secure these states.

Former President Donald Trump’s remarks at the Al Smith Dinner, an annual fundraiser for Catholic charities, won applause and laughter from the crowd. It’s a longstanding tradition for both major party candidates to attend the dinner and crack some good-natured jokes to foster goodwill amid the partisan rancor of the campaign season.

But Vice President Kamala Harris broke tradition to avoid facing Trump’s remarks, skipping the event and sending a pre-recorded video in her place.



“My opponent feels like she does not have to be here, which is deeply disrespectful to the event, and in particular to our great Catholic community. Very disrespectful,” Trump said to applause.

Harris submitted a pre-recorded video with comedian Molly Shannon, playing the Catholic Saturday Night Live character Mary Catherine Gallagher. It opened with a blushing Gallagher approaching Harris.

“I just want to say that I’m Catholic, and tonight is one of the biggest dinners next to the Last Supper,” Shannon said, proceeding to sing about female empowerment.

She mocked Catholics and said Jesus would be fact checking Trump at the speech.

“Does it bother you that that Trump guy insults you all the time? Because it really bothers my friends and me,” Shannon said to Harris.

The video ended with Harris’ platitudes about coming together and finding common ground — despite her absence at the event.

Comedian Jim Gaffigan spoke afterward, poking fun at Harris’ attempted humor.

“I don’t even know what that noise you’re making is,” Gaffigan said. “As I watched that, I couldn’t help but think that, ‘Now I know how my kids felt when I FaceTimed into a piano recital.’”

But Trump came across very likable, amiable to even political rivals like Democrats New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

“It’s been a long tradition for both Democrat and Republican candidates for president of the United States to attend this dinner. Always, it’s a rule, you’ve got to go to the dinner, otherwise bad things are going to happen to you from up there,” Trump said to laughter from the attendees. “You do something that’s incredible, the Catholic Church. You’re helping the poor, educating children, and supporting the vulnerable.”

Trump made light of his recent struggles with attempts on his life and partisan lawfare.

“I guess I just don’t see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time,” Trump said. “These days, it’s really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance.”

He still poked plenty of fun at Democrats, saying initial ballot returns are looking optimistic.

“Chuck Schumer is here looking very glum,” Trump said. “But look on the bright side. Considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you’ll still have a chance to become the first woman president.”

Trump didn’t forget to mention Harris.

“I really hoped that she would come, because I can’t get enough of her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy,” Trump said. “Instead of attending tonight, she’s in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. That’s not a pretty sight.”

He joked about Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, having an affair with a nanny.

“A major issue in this race is childcare, and Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don’t like it,” Trump said. “The only piece of advice I would have for her in the event she wins would be not to let husband Doug anywhere near the nannies.”

Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, didn’t escape scrutiny either.

“The reason that she’s not here is that she’s hunting with her running mate,” Trump said. “I used to think Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods. Then I met Tim Walz.”

Trump joked about the group “White Dudes for Harris,” which attempts — and often fails — to pander to white men.

“There’s a group called ‘White Dudes for Harris,’” Trump said. “But I’m not worried about them at all because their wives and their wives’ lovers are all voting for me.”

Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa apparently didn’t watch the same speech, claiming Trump “struggled to read scripted notes written by his handlers, repeatedly complaining that he couldn’t use a teleprompter … The rare moments he was off script, he went on long incomprehensible rambles, reminding Americans how unstable he’s become.”

Legacy media joined in on the effort to paint Trump’s performance as negatively as possible. “Trump Delivers Profanity, Below-The-Belt Digs At Catholic Charity Banquet,” reads a headline from The Washington Post.

The article claimed “the only person off limits for Trump’s roast was himself,” which is not exactly true considering he made light of lawfare and the assassination attempts against him.

The Associated Press called Trump’s speech “pointed and at times bitter,” and another headline from The Washington Post claimed “Trump lobs insults at Al Smith dinner, Harris campaigns in Wisconsin.”

“The last Democrat not to attend this event was Walter Mondale, and it did not go very well for him,” Trump said. “If Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening, they would have just sent Joe Biden.”

“The View” co-hosts accused the annual Al Smith Dinner, a Catholic charity event, of normalizing Republican nominee Donald Trump’s alleged sins by allowing him to attend.

Trump attended the white tie Catholic dinner Thursday night unlike Vice President Kamala Harris who broke tradition by not showing up to the event in-person and instead released a pre-recorded video. The co-hosts said the Catholic event should not have allowed the former president to attend due to his alleged affair with former porn actress Stormy Daniels and his felony convictions.

“I hate to break with tradition because this is a tradition and it’s a tradition to have both presidential candidates come to this particular dinner,” co-host Sunny Hostin said. “But sometimes there’s just time to break tradition. You can’t have a felon, a liar, a serial cheater. You know, he had Melania [Trump] next to him, now his third wife who cheated with Stormy Daniels on while she was pregnant. I think he stands against everything that flies in the face of it, everything that a Catholic believes and holds dear, he is not a faithful man … That is not a person you should have normalized by the Catholic Church.”

“Well the Haitians in particular I think was an egregious sin because those are Catholics,” co-host Joy Behar said. “And Cardinal [Timothy] Dolan should know that.” (RELATED: Al Smith Dinner Organizer Caught On Hot Mic Interrupting Jim Gaffigan During Gnarly Joke)

Behar referred to Trump echoing unproven rumors that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating cats and decapitating ducks in the public parks. Residents in Springfield have lamented the housing crunch, a rise in crime and car wrecks, and the witnessing of public sex acts since Haitians flooded into their community.

Co-host Ana Navarro said it is “offensive” that Trump would be at a Catholic event because the religion is supposed to help immigrants. Co-host Sara Haines said Trump needed to be at the event to expose himself and prove that he cannot laugh at himself.

“I disagree that being a lead Republican candidate that was nominated by his party, whether I agree or not, they need to be there because why tell people he’s crazy, we benched him? Let him speak for himself. He did that, like let voters decide … Did you hear his jokes? But anyone who can not laugh at themselves, that’s what got us Donald Trump,” Haines said.

Harris skipped the event and instead released submitted a pre-recorded video to be aired during the event alongside “Saturday Night Live” actress Molly Shannon.

Trump is leading Harris 52% to 47% among Catholic voters, according to the Pew Research Center. The former president holds a 5-point advantage among Harris, 50% to 45%, among that voter bloc, a poll conducted by the National Catholic Reporter found.

The former president is currently ahead in all the key swing states as the election draws nearer, RealClear polling averages found Friday.

Several Democratic Senate candidates praised some of former President Donald Trump’s policies in advertisements as the 2024 campaign nears its end.

Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin as well as Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin have all recently launched new political ads promoting Trump-era policies. A recent advertisement from Baldwin promotes policies aimed at increasing the use of American materials for domestic infrastructure projects.

Slotkin and her Republican opponent Mike Rogers have been locked in a close race in Michigan. The two Senate candidates are competing in a tossup state, according to an Oct. 9 poll from Quinnipiac.

Casey is leading by 3.8 points in Pennsylvania against Republican David McCormick, according to RealClearPolling. In Wisconsin, Baldwin is ahead by 2.7 points against Republican opponent Eric Hovde, according to RealClearPolling.

“We can’t let China steal Wisconsin jobs, so I wrote a law to require American infrastructure projects use American iron and steel,” Baldwin narrates in the ad.

“Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill,” the ad said. “And then, she got President Biden to make it permanent.”

Trump said in September that he would place 200% tariffs on John Deere products if the company relocated its manufacturing to Mexico, and he also previously slammed China for placing tariffs on U.S. goods in August 2019. President Joe Biden announced in May that he would raise tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) imported into the U.S. from China, despite criticizing the policy during his presidential campaign in 2020.

Casey also recently launched an ad supporting some of Trump’s policies, including fracking. Trump said in 2016 he supports fracking but thinks that it should be decided by local voters.

“Casey’s leading the effort to stop corporate greedflation and price gouging,” a narrator said in the ad. “Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking, and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating.”

Slotkin also released a television ad in early October attacking EV mandates, despite her having previously voted in favor of them— which is a Biden-Harris administration policy Trump has repeatedly derided. (RELATED: Chuck Todd Fears Swing-State Dem Senator’s Days In Washington Are Numbered)

“I’m Elissa Slotkin, I live on a dirt road, nowhere near a charging station,” Slotkin said in the ad. “So I don’t own an electric car. No one should tell us what to buy, and no one’s gonna mandate anything. But here’s the thing, if there’s going to be a new generation of vehicles, I want that new generation built right here in Michigan, not China. I approve this message because what you drive is your call, no one else’s.”

The Biden-Harris administration has been funding various initiatives aimed at getting American car owners to switch to using EVs. The administration has pushed funding for EV charging stations in the hopes to meet its goal of installing 500,000 stations in the U.S. by 2030, but have yet to meet their goal amid logistical hurdles and slow progress. Many U.S. autoworkers are considering voting for Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

The Biden-Harris Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) doled out billions of taxpayer dollars in August to a left-wing nonprofit consortium linked to Democratic voter mobilization efforts, including a Stacey Abrams’ get-out-the-vote initiative based in Georgia.

The EPA announced that Power Forward Communities (PFC) received $2 billion under the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) on Aug. 16. The PFC is partnering with an array of Democratic Party-affiliated groups in addition to the two-time Georgia governor candidate Abrams’ Fair Count, including the nation’s largest teachers union—a major contributor to Democratic candidates—and a prominent climate activist group, according to a review of the PFC’s website.

The EPA’s decision to award the nonprofit consortium with a massive grant award comes as Republican lawmakers scrutinize the IRA for sending taxpayer dollars to recipients with ties to left-wing activists and the Democratic Party.

“At the same time that the EPA is disrupting our everyday lives, it has shown its true priorities by dishing out hard-working American taxpayer dollars to a vast network of former Obama-era officials who are now leading the far-left’s crusade against American energy independence,” Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia and Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky wrote in an October op-ed for the Washington Reporter.

The PFC is working with two Abrams-backed nonprofit ventures, Fair Count and the Southern Economic Advancement Project (SEAP), according to a review by the DCNF. Abrams founded both of these nonprofits in 2019 following her first election loss to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in November 2018. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams’ Nonprofit Implodes After Shelling Out Millions In Failed Election Fights)

Fair Count, a Georgia-focused voter mobilization outfit that works to increase the participation of the state’s Black voters, recently criticized voter ID requirements and accused Republican governors of “voter purges” to exclude eligible voters from casting ballots.

Abrams’ SEAP is a research and advocacy-focused nonprofit whose mission claims to be “building a more equitable future” in the South. The SEAP is a fiscal project of the Tides Center, a subsidiary of the left-wing dark money behemoth known as the Tides Network that has bankrolled activist groups engaged in pro-Hamas protests across the United States.

Third Act, a left-wing activist group focused on galvanizing Americans age 60 and older into climate activism, is also a PFC partner. The group regularly participates in climate protests and staged a “die-in” in front of Citibank headquarters in New York City in July during which 46 of its members were arrested. Third Act has also organized get-out-the-vote efforts and operates GrayPAC, a political action committee that funds Democratic candidates and left-wing causes.

Third Act’s founder, Bill McKibben, has endorsed Harris and headlined a fundraiser for her presidential campaign in a July 25 event that raised more than $100,000.

The PFC is also partnering with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a teachers union with nearly 2 million members led by Democratic Party bigwig, Randi Weingarten. The AFT’s executive council unanimously endorsed Harris on July 22, the day after Biden dropped out of the 2024 Presidential race, and is currently engaged in get-out-the-vote efforts in support of Democratic candidates. Weingarten spoke at the Democratic National Committee’s Convention in Chicago in August. (RELATED: Massive Teachers Union Used Taxpayer-Funded Dues For Pricey Meeting At Legendary Casino)

Fair Count, the SEAP, Third Act and the AFT did not respond to DCNF’s inquiry about their relationship to the PFC.

Abrams also serves as a senior advisor to Rewiring America, one of the five nonprofit entities that make up the PFC consortium. Rewiring America is a left-wing electrification outfit that advocates for the adoption of electric vehicles and household appliances to curb fossil fuel use. The nonprofit previously listed Abrams as its senior counsel.

Rewiring America did not respond to the DCNF’s request for clarification on Abrams new role.

Abrams, while speaking in her previous capacity as senior counsel for Rewiring America, used nonpartisan language to imply that a key part of the nonprofit’s mission is to mobilize voters to cast ballots for Democratic candidates in November.

“The work of winning an election is not simply who is running. It’s not just what’s on the ballot; it’s who’s in the booth. And to get people into the booth, you have groups like Rewiring America, a nonpartisan organization that exists to tell people what’s possible,” Abrams said during an interview alongside Rewiring America’s CEO, Ari Matusiak, at the Bloomberg Green Ideas festival in Seattle in July. “That’s the work of everyone who cares about the future of this country. And so I’m not concerned, I’m committed. And our job is to convince every person who shares that value system and wants to see that future to show up and do the same work and get more people to vote.”

During the interview, Abrams also endorsed President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s then-2024 Presidential candidate, and described the reelection of former President Donald Trump as an “existential crisis.”

Following Biden’s decision to end his campaign for a second term, Abrams quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Rewiring America’s senior policy counsel Dr. Leah Stokes has also endorsed and fundraised for the Harris campaign.

The EPA, the PFC, and Rewiring America did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

The DCNF previously reported that another GGRF recipient, Coalition for Green Capital, held an Aug. 23 webinar during which the nonprofit’s CEO, Reed Hundt, called for the elimination of the United States’ fossil fuel industry and urged the Biden administration to work with the Chinese Communist Party to “change the way that everything is organized in society.”

Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, discussed the state of his race against incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and the key issues on voters’ minds ahead of Election Day in a Thursday interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Fresh off of his final debate against Casey on Tuesday night, McCormick spoke with the DCNF about key issues on Pennsylvanians’ minds like mass immigration and natural gas. Despite being a self-described “underdog” against Casey, McCormick made clear that he believes the momentum is on his side with just 18 days to go until voters head to the polls.

“I feel a lot of great momentum. I’m the underdog in this race. I’m being outspent, despite the lies of Bob Casey. If you look at the spending, he and his allies are outspending me by a lot. But I have enough to get my message out on the air, and I have huge momentum on the ground,” McCormick told the DCNF. “There’s lots of people knocking on doors. Millions of doors have already been knocked and will be knocked between now and November 5, signs everywhere. Listen, I feel it on the ground. I feel a lot of enthusiasm, and the polling supports it. If you look at the last two months, my polling has closed to where it’s a tie race. And so the momentum is on my side. The more people get to know me, and the more they focus on Bob Casey, the better it is for me. And that’s what’s happening.” (RELATED: GOP Senate Candidate Says He And Fetterman Could Be ‘Good Allies’)

Casey is a three-term senator first elected to the chamber in the 2006 election cycle, and his father was the former governor of Pennsylvania. The incumbent senator has voted with President Joe Biden 98.5% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight.

The RealClearPolitics polling average shows that the race has tightened: in February, the average had Casey leading McCormick by about nine points, but the most recent data now indicates that Casey now leads by less than four percentage points. The Pennsylvania race has also proven to be one of the most expensive of any contest in this election cycle, with the two candidates and outside groups pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the contest so far, according to OpenSecrets.

The Pennsylvania Senate race may end up deciding which party controls the chamber for the next two years, so it is no surprise that so much money is rushing in to affect the pivotal contest.

The massive increase in illegal immigration that marked President Joe Biden’s term has impacted Pennsylvania as it has nearly every other state in the country, and the issue is on voters’ minds in the Keystone State: 38% of Pennsylvanian respondents in a September poll by Monmouth University identified immigration as one of the two top issues in the 2024 election cycle. The DCNF recently reported that mass immigration is straining the state’s school system because school districts are shelling out needed resources to accommodate large numbers of students who do not speak English as their first language.

The burden the immigration surge places on social services further highlights the need for the government to reestablish order at the border, said McCormick, who added that his wife is an immigrant and that he supports legal immigration.

“There are so many first-, second- and third-order consequences of the border crisis that the most important thing is first to stop the flow. We have to secure the border. That’s first and foremost, job number one. And then, when you look at the 10 million people or more that have come in, there’s a triage that you’re going to have to do,” McCormick told the DCNF. “It’s going to be very challenging if your goal is to basically send everybody home that’s here illegally, which I think we should.”

Apart from immigration, abortion access and economic conditions are also major concerns for Pennsylvania voters, which may not be surprising that the same issues are on the electorate’s mind nationwide, according to the Monmouth poll. However, energy policy and fracking are topics that may end up playing a particularly strong role in Pennsylvania’s Senate and presidential races given the natural gas industry’s economic importance in the state. (RELATED: Chuck Todd Fears Swing-State Dem Senator’s Days In Washington Are Numbered)

Pennsylvania produced more natural gas than any other state in the country other than Texas in 2022, and the industry directly or indirectly supports about 123,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, according to an August 2023 FTI Consulting report commissioned by the Marcellus Shale Coalition. However, the Biden-Harris administration issued numerous anti-fossil fuel regulations, created new de facto taxes on the natural gas industry and stopped approving certain natural gas export hubs in the years since 2021, leading many pundits and industry experts predicting more of the same if Vice President Kamala Harris wins.

Harris said there’s “no question” fracking should be banned while running for president in the 2020 cycle, though her campaign has disavowed that position after she replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee. While Harris has attempted to suggest that she is much less hostile to natural gas and other fossil fuels in recent months, one of her top climate advisers undercut that messaging by saying that Harris is “not promoting expansion” of fossil fuels in an interview with Politico Pro.

Anecdotally, working- and middle-class Pennsylvanians seem to be motivated by the contrast on energy issues in this election cycle, particularly in the northern and western regions of the state that are home to massive gas deposits, McCormick told the DCNF.

“What’s happened under Biden and Harris — and Bob Casey’s been 100% supportive of this — has been a war on fossil fuels. The goal is to reduce energy demand for fossil fuels, and increase the price of energy to reduce carbon emissions. That’s the goal, and to do that by putting all sorts of red tape and bureaucracy, and making it much more difficult to frack,” McCormick told the DCNF. “You don’t have to ban fracking explicitly. To ban fracking, you just increase regulations, put bans in place, red tape, EPA mandates, and that drives up the price of fuel. Fuel prices are up 50%, and that’s exactly what’s happened. That’s disastrous for our industry as it exists, but it also stands in the way of the natural gas industry, doubling, tripling, quadrupling in Pennsylvania, creating hundreds of thousands, potentially millions, of jobs if we unlocked the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world. So, that issue is resonating, because people’s futures depend on these great-paying jobs.”

“I think workers in the oil and gas industry, and the trades in general — pipefitters, steamfitters, welders — the rank-and-file all see that Biden, Harris and Casey are not going to be friends to their economic future. So, I think [energy policy] is a big issue, and don’t let the national level union endorsements for Kamala Harris or Bob Casey fool you, I think the rank and file has a very different view of things,” McCormick continued.

Barring any major and unexpected development, the contest between McCormick and Casey looks like it will be decided by a tight margin, but McCormick likes his chances. He believes he has the momentum and the gumption to close out the campaign with a victory, and that the contrast between his record and that of Casey and the Democrats is too strong for voters to look past.

“I think this is a race of contrast. It’s a race between change and status quo. It’s a race between strength and weakness,” McCormick told the DCNF. “It’s a race between someone who’s a combat vet, a West Point grad, a business guy, a political outsider, seventh generation Pennsylvanian, versus a guy who was born with a political spoon in his mouth and has been in elected office for years, and has been weak, and votes with his party 99% of the time on this crazy liberal agenda.”

If Kamala Harris becomes president, the policies that have plagued California could soon become the reality for the entire country.

California, under the leadership of Harris and Gov. Gavin Newsom, foreshadows America’s fate if Harris ascends to the presidency. The state has aggressively pursued climate policies, which, while championed as progressive and forward-thinking, have also proven costly and economically burdensome for its residents. These policies, enacted in the name of combating climate change, offer a glimpse into the Biden-Harris administration’s whole-of-government approach and its harmful effect on Americans.

California’s climate actions, epitomized by legislation like the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, have made the state a trailblazer in renewable energy initiatives. However, this has come at a steep cost to consumers. For instance, California consistently ranks among the states with the highest electricity prices, second only to Hawaii. As of mid-2024, Californians were paying 25.93 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the national average and significantly higher than states like Texas, which boasts a competitive energy market with prices about 162 percent lower. These inflated costs result from policies that favor non-dispatchable energy sources like wind and solar, requiring extensive investments in grid upgrades and new infrastructure — expenses that are ultimately passed on to consumers.

In the push for a green economy, California has also implemented stringent regulations and mandates, especially on land use and energy production. This has led to a housing crisis, exacerbated by strangled land development and inflated building costs. The state’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which accounts for the cost of living, has consistently shown California leading the nation in poverty rates — No. 1 for poverty since 2009. Despite its wealth and natural resources, more than 15 percent of its residents live below the poverty line.

While the Biden-Harris administration has aggressively pursued similar climate policies at the federal level, through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, there is growing evidence that these initiatives will not deliver the promised economic benefits. Instead, they could mirror California’s struggles with skyrocketing energy prices, regulatory burdens, and stagnant economic growth for middle- and lower-income families.

As someone who served in the California State Assembly for six years before moving to Texas, I’ve seen firsthand the detrimental effects of California’s climate-centric policies. My decision to relocate to Texas, along with hundreds of thousands of other former Californians, was driven by the state’s growing hostility toward business and job creation.

California’s leadership often touts its environmental achievements, but those come at the cost of economic opportunity for working-class citizens. In stark contrast, Texas, with its more business-friendly environment, has seen robust economic growth and lower living costs, illustrating an alternative path for governance — not only at the state level, but for the federal government as well.

California’s energy policies, particularly its aggressive push toward renewable energy, have also contributed to the state’s vulnerability to wildfires. Utility companies like PG&E have struggled to balance the state’s high regulatory demands with maintaining aging infrastructure. In 2019, PG&E’s power lines sparked the deadly Camp Fire, a catastrophe that might have been averted had regulators approved the necessary rate hikes for maintenance and safety upgrades. The reluctance to raise electricity rates further, due to the already high costs imposed by renewable mandates, has led to underinvestment in critical infrastructure, with devastating results.

Moreover, California’s mismanagement of its forests — stemming from stringent environmental regulations that limit timber harvesting and controlled burns — has led to a dangerous accumulation of wildfire fuel. These policies have not only increased the risk of catastrophic wildfires but also made homeowners’ insurance increasingly scarce and expensive. Many Californians, especially in high-risk areas, now struggle to find affordable insurance, further compounding the state’s cost-of-living crisis.

As we look toward the 2024 presidential election, it’s essential to recognize that California’s challenges could become America’s challenges. The Biden-Harris administration’s climate agenda mirrors many of the policies that have put California at a disadvantage. The administration’s “whole-of-government” approach to climate policy, which includes heavy subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy projects, is set to cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. Yet, the return on these investments is uncertain. Even as California leads the nation in EV adoption and renewable energy use, it still consumes roughly the same amount of hydrocarbons as it did in 1980, revealing the difficulty of transitioning away from traditional energy sources.

The administration’s push to electrify the transportation sector, for instance, will require massive upgrades to the nation’s electrical grid, with costs estimated between $2.4 to $4 trillion. These upgrades will be necessary to accommodate the increased electricity demand from EVs, yet the financial burden will fall squarely on taxpayers and consumers. In states like California, where the cost of electricity is already prohibitively high, these additional costs could push even more people into energy poverty.

California’s experience is a warning to the rest of the nation. The state’s climate policies have driven up costs, stifled economic growth, and hurt the most vulnerable populations.

As the Biden-Harris administration continues to push its climate agenda on a national scale, Americans should carefully consider the potential consequences. California, once the land of opportunity, now stands as a cautionary tale of what happens when government overreach and regulatory excess are prioritized over economic prosperity and individual freedom.
A member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has asked the body’s chair to take up a complaint filed with the FCC to compel CBS to release the full transcript from its “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Daily Caller News Foundation learned first.

CBS aired two different broadcasts with separate answers from Harris in response to the same question from “60 Minutes” interviewer Bill Whitaker on whether Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “listening” to the Biden-Harris administration. FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington told the DCNF that while the commission often receives frivolous complaints alleging news distortion, the complaint lodged on Oct. 16 by the Center for American Rights (CAR) against WCBS, CBS’ New York subsidiary, is substantively different and should not be dismissed at face value.

“Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,” Harris responded in a previewed clip of the “60 Minutes” interview that aired on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Oct. 6.

“We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end, “Harris answered during the “60 Minutes” broadcast that aired the following night in primetime.

Monday, on a 60 Minutes election special, Bill Whitaker asks Vice President Kamala Harris if the U.S. lacks influence over American ally Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. https://t.co/TG3WOCA23A pic.twitter.com/IH6MXMjuCP — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) October 6, 2024

“The FCC does not regulate, or really even respond to, allegations of politically unfavorable coverage or legitimate editorial discretion,” Simington wrote in a statement to the DCNF. “The recent complaint regarding WCBS-TV raises a fully different set of issues regarding whether or not coverage was intentionally distorted: reporting that something was said in response to a question that literally was not. I don’t know whether that’s true, but it’s a different issue.”

A person familiar with the FCC told the DCNF that while CAR’s complaint could potentially move forward, the Democratic chair of the commission, Jessica Rosenworcel, is unlikely to act on the complaint, especially 18 days before the presidential election. In the event former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, the commission could be given a green light to act on the complaint with a Republican commissioner appointed as chair, the person told the DNCF.

When any of CBS News’ wholly owned and operated broadcast subsidiaries attempt to renew their license under a majority Republican FCC, the commission could put conditions on the license, including compelling the broadcaster to release the “60 Minutes” transcript, according to the person.

CAR’s complaint alleges that because WCBS aired two distinct broadcasts of the Harris interview — one on “Face the Nation” and the other on “60 Minutes” — with different responses from the Democratic candidate, the conflicting answers “amount to deliberate news distortion.” (RELATED: CBS Quietly Edits Harris Word Salad Response In ’60 Minutes’ Interview)

“CBS crosses a line when its production reaches the point of so transforming an interviewee’s answer that it is a fundamentally different answer. This, CBS may not do,” the CAR complaint states. “Here, CBS has taken a single question and transformed Harris’ answer such the general public no longer has any confidence as to what the Vice President actually said in response to the query.”

“This isn’t just about one interview or one network. This is about the public’s trust in the media on critical issues of national security and international relations during one of the most consequential elections of our time,” Daniel Suhr, CAR president, wrote in a statement to the DCNF. “When broadcasters manipulate interviews and distort reality, it undermines democracy itself. The FCC must act swiftly to restore public confidence in our news media.”

Trump’s campaign has called for CBS subsidiaries’ licenses to be revoked and for the network to release the full interview transcript.

“The American people deserve the full, unedited transcript from Kamala’s sit-down interview,” Karoline Leavitt told The New York Post. “We call upon 60 Minutes and CBS to release it. What do they, and Kamala, have to hide?”

“A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes. Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 10. “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. Election Interference. She is a Moron, and the Fake News Media wants to hide that fact. An UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL!!! The Dems got them to do this and should be forced to concede the Election? WOW!”

CBS has so far declined to release the interview transcript. CBS’ New York subsidiary did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter exposed how out-of-touch white liberals are with the rest of America while sparring Thursday night with Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton.

The conversation was initially about Americans being exhausted by the federal government’s continued taxpayer-funded support for the war in Ukraine while major issues at home going unaddressed. FEMA is running out of money for the victims of Hurricane Helene, America’s infrastructure is crumbling and our school systems are failing. Still, Stelter found a way to make it about himself and discount the reality millions Americans face.

“There are a lot of Americans who don’t live in great cities, who do have to send their kids to terrible schools. That is a fact because of their zip codes.” – @MrShermichael https://t.co/HDnvwxa2we — Harold Hutchison (@HaroldHutchison) October 18, 2024

“My point is that a lot of people look at how much money we’ve spent on this conflict, and they’re asking themselves, ‘My roads are crumbling; my schools suck. We just had major disasters across the country; FEMA doesn’t have enough money —'” Singleton said.

“By the way, I don’t live in that country. I don’t live in that country, by the way. America is not that horrible,” Stelter responded, to which Singleton quipped, “Brian, if you get out of New York and talk to regular people …” (Harris Campaign’s Last-Ditch Effort To Salvage Damning Political Misstep Will Backfire Even Worse)

Singleton couldn’t finish his thought without Stelter interrupting and claiming to be a resident of a “normal city,” not New York. “My roads are not crumbling; my schools don’t suck. I just get tired of the anti-America rhetoric,” Stelter said.

Do you think that Ukraine has been prioritized over the needs of Americans affected by disasters like Hurricane Helene? @DailyCaller Check out @MrShermichael going at it with Brian Stelter on CNN. pic.twitter.com/tkfDKJ0opo — Harold Hutchison (@HaroldHutchison) October 18, 2024

Despite Stelter’s insistence, tax documents show he doesn’t live in a so-called “normal city.” He lives in Readington Township, New Jersey, where less than 3% of the population lives in poverty, and the median household income is $141,802, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The typical family in Readington Township makes $67,222 more a year than the average American. Readington Township has very little diversity, being a predominately white town (85.6%), with less than 10% being Hispanic and roughly 5% Black or Asian.

Former CNN reporter Brian Stelter is seeking a seat on the Readington Township, New Jersey school board, @wildstein is reporting.

The former host of Reliable Sources is one of six candidates interviewing to fill a vacant seat caused by the resignation of Christina Napoli. — Shlomo Schorr (@OneJerseySchorr) February 20, 2024

His school district received the state’s second-highest District Factor Group (DFG) score. New Jersey uses the DFG scoring system to rate the socioeconomic status (median income, level of education, percent of homeless or poor population, etc.) of citizens in school districts. Only 25 school districts in the state have a higher score than Readington Township, and over 420 that rank lower.

Just 1.4% of Reading Township School District students are English Language Learners, and only 5% qualify for reduced or free lunch assistance. (ROOKE: Feds Quietly Correct Major Election Bomb Harris Doesn’t Want Blowing Up In Her Face)

With these stats, it’s no wonder Stelter doesn’t experience failing schools and crumbling roads. He lives in a mostly white, upscale area where people make a lot of money, pay their taxes and things generally work as they should. Reading Township can focus on teaching math, science and reading without a language barrier because their classrooms aren’t full of children brought in by the Biden-Harris administration who don’t speak English or understand American culture.

“My roads are not crumbling, my schools don’t suck” Where does Stelter send his kids to school? I’d bet it’s private and expensive https://t.co/jntytcwMAv — Geoffrey Ingersoll (@GPIngersoll) October 18, 2024

Stelter isn’t alone in his way of thinking. He is merely a representation of his kind– smug, overfed, white liberals who have no concept that the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic policies are absolutely crushing the rest of America.

Does he not understand that millions of parents can’t afford to live in a nice, safe neighborhood? Or that their only option for their children’s education is to send them to the local public school, which is filled with chaos, violence and little actual learning? He might as well have told his fellow CNN panelists that Americans should just try not to be poor.

My advice to Stelter is to put down the hoagie and open your eyes. People are hurting.
Vulnerable incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey turned heads Friday with a new campaign ad in Pennsylvania that highlights how he "bucked Biden" and "sided" with former President Trump.

In a TV spot released Friday morning, a married couple with different political views each praise Casey as an "independent," highlighting his support for Trump's trade policies and efforts to "protect fracking" from the Biden administration. The ad, called "Bliss," features a Republican woman named Marygrace and her Democrat husband, Joe.

"Our marriage – pure bliss! But on politics, we just don’t agree. Except for Bob Casey. He’s independent," Marygrace says, with her husband chiming in, "That's right!"

FIREWORKS EXPECTED IN FINAL PENNSYLVANIA SENATE DEBATE IN RACE THAT MAY DECIDE CHAMBER'S MAJORITY

"Casey’s leading the effort to stop corporate greedflation and price-gouging," Marygrace continues. "Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating. So in this house, we agree, it’s Bob Casey who’s doing right by Pennsylvania."

Casey himself appears at the end of the 30-second video and says, "I’m Bob Casey and definitely approve this message."

KEY PENNSYLVANIA REGION SEES ‘WAITLIST’ FOR TRUMP SIGNS; LAWMAKER SAYS VOTERS READY TO REVERSE DEM POLICIES

Fox News' Power Rankings rate the Pennsylvania Senate election as "Leans Dem." Casey, the son of a popular former governor, is running for a fourth six-year term. His Republican challenger is Dave McCormick, a combat veteran and businessman.

Public opinion polls have shown Casey with a consistent, but narrow, lead over McCormick. However, Republicans were quick to suggest that Casey, by highlighting his work with Trump, is telegraphing unease as Election Day draws closer.

Elizabeth Gregory, a McCormick spokesperson, said the ad was "another sign of desperation from flailing career politician Bob Casey."

Republican critics also called attention to how the ad curiously neglects to mention Casey's support for Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. The senator did not appear with Harris at her most recent rallies in Erie and Washington Crossing.

GOP state Rep. Russ Diamond said Casey is now "running ads cozying up to Trump."

"He knows Kamala is going to lose," Diamond posted on Facebook.

Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, who is locked in a tough race with Republican challenger Eric Hovde, is also running an ad that cites Trump in a favorable light. In the spot, the former president is shown signing into law legislation Baldwin sponsored while Trump was in office. Baldwin previously ran the same ad in March of this year.

"These are liberal Democrats who have opposed Donald Trump every step of the way going back years, voting with Chuck Schumer all the time, but faced with their own defeats, they have suddenly publicly embraced Trump in their own TV ads," Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh told Fox News Digital. "Not only does this mean that Trump is winning the battle of ideas, it also means they know he is winning in their states."

"This is undeniable, irrefutable proof that Trump is winning in these key battlegrounds, and those bumps you hear are Kamala Harris being thrown under the bus by incumbent Democrats, who used to be her colleagues in the Senate. The Harris camp must be beside themselves with fury over being rejected and abandoned like this, but that’s what happens when you get stuck with the worst candidate in modern political history."

Kate Smart, a Casey campaign spokesperson, said the senator "does what's right for Pennsylvania, regardless of party."

"Whether it’s standing up to China or fighting corporate greed, he stands with Pennsylvanians and doesn't care what any politician has to say about it."
One would expect that Kamala Harris, the protege of the first Catholic president since JFK, would have put more effort into her (non) appearance at the Al Smith dinner for Catholic charities Thursday night in New York City.

But then again, to expect anything more from Kamala than fits of ungovernable laughter and highly original but highly stupid aphorisms about the future being unburdened by the past is, well, unrealistic.

Harris was the first presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984 to skip the event, which has traditionally seen candidates from both parties take swipes at each other in a somewhat civil manner leading up to the election. In addition to raising money for charities, the historic white tie event, dating back to 1945, has offered some fantastic entertainment, including Trump’s infamous roast of Hillary Clinton back in 2016.

Unlike Trump, who of course was in attendance Thursday night — how could Trump the showman, Trump the comedian, miss an opportunity for a standup set? — Harris balked at her chance to mock the former president in person and sent a deeply unfunny, pre-recorded video instead.

As a Catholic, I am less offended that she failed to even show up to the dinner, less offended that she supports abortion and transgenderism, and more offended by the atrocious comedy she offered attendees last night, by her abysmal sense of humor, or lack thereof.

NEW: Kamala Harris releases her pre-recorded video for the Al Smith dinner in New York that she didn’t show up for. Comedian Jim Gaffigan made fun of the Vice President after the crowd gave a dismal applause once it ended. Cringe. pic.twitter.com/9dvsYQub9h — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) October 18, 2024

Harris’ preachy skit featured B-list comedian Molly Shannon as Mary Katherine Gallagher, a recurring Catholic school girl character from her days on SNL in the 90s. Not only is it a B-character that most people, including SNL fans, will probably not even recognize, it’s also an obnoxious character, a trite, shrieking, tone-deaf depiction of a Catholic, that will make the people who do remember her wish they hadn’t.

The video was so mediocre, so slapdash, that Harris would have been better off beaming in a grainy video of herself taking a Springfield, Ohio, house cat, sticking it between two slabs of white bread, and chowing down like ALF from the eponymous 80s sitcom. And before enjoying her feline cutlet, Harris could have dedicated the meal to the Haitian voodoo spirit, Loa, as a sacrifice to balance out the karmic energies of the universe and bring about a landslide victory against Trump. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

“Loa, voodoo spirit of the netherworlds, you who exists in the context, of all in which you live and what came before you. Hear this message, witness this sacrifice, and unburden us by what has been so that we can bring about what can be, in the future.”

*nervous laugh, takes a bite*

It would still offend Catholics, of course. But at least it would be entertaining.
As the 2024 election showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump reaches the home stretch, Harris will team up next week with arguably the two most popular Democrats in the country.

The Harris campaign announced on Friday that the vice president will join former President Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, for get-out-the-vote events in two of the seven crucial battleground states - Georgia and Michigan.

According to the campaign, Harris will team up with the Obamas in Georgia on Thursday, Oct. 24. Early voting kicked off in the key southeastern battleground earlier this week and instantly set a new record.

Harris advisers also said that the vice president will join forces again on the campaign trail in Michigan on Saturday, Oct. 26, the day that early voting gets underway statewide in the crucial Great Lakes battleground.

CAMPAIGN BATTLE BETWEEN THE BILLIONAIRES: MARK CUBAN AND ELON MUSK HIT THE TRAIL FOR HARRIS AND TRUMP

This will be the first time that Harris has teamed up with either Obama on the campaign trail since she replaced President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket nearly three months ago.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH THESE ANTI-TRUMP REPUBLICANS

The Obamas - longtime friends of Harris - officially endorsed her for president in July, five days after Biden's blockbuster announcement that he was dropping his re-election bid and backing his vice president.

The former president and former first lady made the case for Harris during back-to-back headlining addresses at the Democratic National Convention in August in their hometown of Chicago.

And the former president hit the campaign trail for Harris a week ago, in Pennsylvania - which is arguably the most crucial of all seven battleground states that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election.

The former president is scheduled to return to the campaign in the coming days, with stops in Tucson, Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada, Detroit, Michigan, and Madison, Wisconsin.

With a razor-thin margin of error race for the White House, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are scrambling to win over and turn out voters as early in-person, absentee, and mail-in balloting is now under way in roughly 40 states across the country.

The Harris campaign aims to use these campaign events to boost voter enthusiasm among the vice president's supporters in order to get out the vote ahead of Election Day on Nov. 5, as well as to boost volunteer engagement to help voter turnout.

States have long allowed at least some Americans to vote early, like members of the military or people with illnesses. Many states expanded eligibility in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic made it riskier to vote in-person.

That year, the Fox News Voter Analysis found that 71% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day, with 30% voting early in-person and 41% voting by mail.

Early voting remained popular in the midterms , with 57% of voters casting a ballot before Election Day.

Fox News Digital's Kellianne Jones and Rémy Numa contributed to this report.
Elon Musk spoke at a campaign rally on Thursday for former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he urged Trump supporters to make sure they are registered to vote and to talk to everyone they know about voting for the 45th president in order to save the United States and “the future of civilization.”

“The most important thing that you can to do, and what I’m asking everyone to do is make sure that you’re register to vote, and then vote early,” Musk said. “Talk to your friends and family, and everyone you know to make sure that they’re registered to vote.”

Watch Below:

“Because Monday is the deadline for voting registration,” the SpaceX CEO added. “And honestly, if there’s ever a time to be a pest with your friends and family, this is the time.”

Musk went on to say he believes the 2024 presidential election could be “decided by Pennsylvania.”

“It could be 10,000 votes. It could be 1,000 votes. It could be ten votes. It could be some very tiny number,” Musk warned. “So every incremental person makes a huge difference.”

“I haven’t been politically active before. I’m politically active now because I think the future of America and the future of civilization is at stake,” the X owner declared.

Musk then put on a gold “Make America Great Again” hat and took questions from audience members.

“I should mention that one of the most fundamental things about me supporting [Trump], and may be the biggest show-stopper of all, for me, in terms of why I feel Donald Trump must win, is that we have to have sensible regulations,” Musk noted during the Q&A portion of the event.

“Last time I checked, we have 428 regulatory agencies,” Musk continued. “So there’s more than an agency a year that has been created since America was a country. We have almost twice as many agencies as years America has been a country.”

“America has been smothered by overregulation,” Musk added, before reiterating that he believes in “sensible regulation.”

“There’s a mountain of rules that actually don’t benefit people, and then there’s missing rules that do benefit people,” Musk said. “So it’s this bizarre, Kafka-esque nightmare of regulations where, ultimately, the good of the people is not served.”

Thursday’s rally marked Musk’s first solo appearance on behalf of the Trump campaign. It comes after the Tesla CEO appeared onstage at Trump’s historic return rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the 45th president survived an assassination attempt after being struck in the ear with a bullet.

In Philadelphia on Thursday, Musk echoed the sentiments he shared at Trump’s October 5 return rally in Butler, reiterating his call for all Trump supporters to register to vote.

“I’m being repetitive for a reason,” Musk said in Butler on October 5. “Fight, fight, fight! Vote, vote, vote!”

Comedian Jim Gaffigan took surprising digs at Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping the 79th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday, instead opting to send a pre-recorded video message to be shown at the bipartisan and light-hearted Catholic charity event.

"You know, this event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. Twenty-two percent of Americans identify as Catholic. Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state," Gaffigan, the emcee of the charity dinner, said Thursday.

"I'm sorry. Why is Vice President Harris not here?" he continued, with some of the audience jeering. "I mean, consider this. This is a room full of Catholics and Jews in New York City. This is a layup for the Democratic nominee. I mean, in her defense, I mean, she did find time to appear on "The View," Howard Stern, Colbert and the long time staple of campaigning, the "Call Her Daddy" podcast. You know what I think it is? I think she doesn't like me."

In another jab at Harris and the Democratic Party, the comedian joked about the political "coup" against President Biden over the summer, when the 46th president dropped out of the presidential race amid mounting calls from members of his own party to exit the race amid concerns over his mental acuity.

"The Democrats have been telling us Trump, Trump's reelection is a threat to democracy. In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup. Ousted their democratically elected incumbent, and installed Kamala Harris," Gaffigan said.

"In other words, all her dreams have come true."

HARRIS TO VIRTUALLY ATTEND CATHOLIC CHARITY DINNER THAT RIVAL TRUMP IS HEADLINING

Harris is the first presidential candidate in 40 years, outside of 2020's virtual dinner during the pandemic, to not physically attend the Catholic charity event. Failed Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in 1984 was the last nominee to skip the event.

Harris' snub of the historic Catholic charity event irked New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, the host of the dinner, on his podcast this week.

"This year will be imbalanced because sadly, Kamala Harris isn't coming," Dolan said on his podcast Tuesday. "It's a shame because the nature of the evening is to bring people together. The nature of the evening is civility, patriotism, humor. It's not a campaign speech. It's not a campaign stop."

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on sending a pre-recorded video message for the event, but did not receive a reply. The campaign previously told Fox News that Harris was skipping the event to focus on campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Thursday.

KAMALA HARRIS PLANS TO SKIP HISTORIC AL SMITH DINNER DESPITE LONG-STANDING TRADITION

"The Vice President is going to be campaigning in a battleground state that day, and the campaign wants to maximize her time in the battlegrounds this close to the election. Her team also told the organizers that she would very much like to attend their event as President. This would make her one of the first sitting Presidents to attend," the campaign said.

Harris recorded a video that was aired during the dinner, in which she was joined by comedian and actress Molly Shannon. During Shannon's days as a cast member on "Saturday Night Live," she played a Catholic student named Mary Katherine Gallgher, a role she reprised for the video.

TRUMP APPLAUDS CATHOLIC GROUP'S MULTI-MILLION ANTI-HARRIS CAMPAIGN APPEALING TO CHURCH FAITHFUL

"So tell me something, I’m giving a speech. Do you have some thoughts about what I might say tonight?" Harris asked Shannon.

"Don’t lie. Thou shall not bear false witness to thy neighbor," Shannon responded.

"Indeed, especially thy neighbor’s election results," Harris said in a jab at Trump.

The Al Smith dinner was launched in 1946, and has raised millions of dollars for charities supporting women and children. It has since grown to become a political and cultural hallmark of election seasons. The dinner is named after the first Catholic presidential candidate, Al Smith, who served as the 42nd governor of New York . He ran for president as a Democrat in 1928.

Kamala Harris’s running mate, millionaire Tim Walz, admits his mother counts on her social security check to feed herself.

This is truly unreal:

“You know what?” Elmer Fudd tells a crowd of supporters about his 90-year-old mother. “When my mom looks for that Social Security deposit to be made in her bank account, that’s how she’s going to feed herself.”

Fudd then says this about Trump: “He doesn’t give a damn if his Social Security check comes or not … If any of our relatives … tell us that Donald Trumps [sic] understand [sic] us — well, that’s bullshit.”

According to Forbes, Walz is worth “over $1 million.” So…

Why does a millionaire’s 90-year-old mom need a Social Security check to feed herself? Why is that monthly check — in Tim’s words — “how she’s going to feed herself”?

His lack of humanity does not surprise me at all, nor does his lack of self-awareness. After all, this is the same asshole who bragged in front of the whole country how, as a teacher, none of his students made it to Yale.

“I had 24 kids in my high school class, and none of them went to Yale,” Walz said during his speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Wait? You’re proud of that?

Get a load of this guy making political points by admitting that none of the kids he was responsible for teaching went to Yale and that his own aged mother stresses over buying food while he swims in a Scrooge McDuck pile of money.

I’m no millionaire and I never will be, but never would I allow my aging parents to worry about something as basic as feeding themselves. What the hell is the matter with this guy that he cannot offer his 90-year-old mother the emotional security of knowing that she has nothing to worry about when it comes to the basics of life: food, shelter, power, and medical care?

Am I virtue signaling when I say I would do everything in my power — millionaire or not — to ensure the last thing my parents ever worried about was food? I sure hope not because I would hate to think about what that says about our society. Isn’t caring for your aging parents one of those things all normal people just do?

Taking care of family is a privilege, not a burden. But heartless millionaire Tim Walz sounds like he doesn’t take very good care of his mother, and then proves he’s terribly out of touch by using his shameful neglect as a political talking point.

John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.
On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Source,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) argued that 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris’ declaration that you have to be “responsible for what happened in your administration” doesn’t apply to her when it comes to the border under the Biden-Harris administration.

Host Kaitlan Collins asked, “Earlier in the interview, as she was talking about providing services for transgender people in the sprawling federal prison system, Harris was arguing that Trump had a similar policy. And she said, at one point, ‘You’ve got to [be responsible] for what happened in your administration.’ Does the same apply to her, though, when she’s being questioned about the border over the last three-and-a-half years?”

Fetterman responded, “No. The whole situation, if you want to talk about the border, I’ve been very clear that the border is an issue, and I don’t know why it would be controversial for Democrats to say we need to have a secure border like that. But we also have to acknowledge, also, that Trump has absolutely tanked — he tanked and he called for the Republicans to tank the bipartisan border deal. And I voted for that and the Republicans refused to do that and that was a great bill. And the Republicans…agreed that that was a great deal. And now, Trump said, this is far too valuable in the election and he has weaponized that and how he’s going to talk about that. The border needed to be secure, and I’ve been very clear and agree with that and that that bill was tanked by Trump.”

A former judge on the famed drag queen game show, RuPaul’s Drag Race is taking heat by the drag community for endorsing Donald Trump for president.

Santino Rice, who appeared as a contestant on Bravo’s Project Runway in 2005 and then later on drag queen star RuPul’s show from season 1 through 6, fell out of the public eye by 2015. rice has been peppering his X account with support for Republicans and Donald Trump and has been excoriating Kamala Harris, but it is one from this month that has put him in the cross hairs of former fans and members of the LGBTQ community.

On Oct. 13, for instance, he wrote, “I would love to see an intelligent and capable woman President some day, Kamala Harris is not her.” And added, “There’s only one obvious candidate to rebuild America and stabilize the rest of the world and that is President Donald J. Trump.”

A list of drag queens have since gone on the attack against Rice, according to Pink News.

Rice, though, has bee undaunted in the face of the withering criticism from the LGBTQ community. In one rejoinder to the critics, for instance, Rice blasted back, writing, “Mentally retarded people calling me insane is the funniest part.”

He also blasted Harris as “dumber than a box of rocks.”

“Kamala Harris is dumber than a box of rocks. The media has brainwashed some of you to hate Donald Trump so much that you will vote for anyone, he wrote on Oct. 15. “Luckily, there are more of us who understand how important this election is for Americans and the future of America!”

Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin argued on Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ Wednesday Fox News interview will likely have no effect on the election.

Harris appeared on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier” for her first formal interview on the network, where Baier challenged the vice president on the border crisis and her plans to move the country “forward” as president. Halperin, on “Wake Up America,” described Harris’ performance as “weak,” but asserted that he has seen limited coverage of the interview in swing states, indicating it will be “probably a nonevent.” (RELATED: Harris Campaign Backpedals From Economic Agenda For Black Men Days After Releasing It)

WATCH:

“I looked at a lot of news in the battleground states today, and it’s barely mentioned. So what I really think is it’s probably a nonevent. You know, we can all analyze it. You can listen to people say it was a triumph,” Halperin said. “You can listen to people say it was a car crash. I think in the end it’s a nonevent because what matters is an impact on the voters and what they hear about it. And I don’t see much again in the seven states that matter.”

“In terms of the interview itself, I think the highlight for her was being feisty and separating herself a little bit from [President] Joe Biden, saying, I think, under-covered so far, that her administration would ‘not be a continuation’ of his,” he continued. “That’s a pretty big break, at least symbolically.”

Harris previously told “The View” that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently from Biden.

“I think her evasiveness, her failure to address the tough questions that were asked on issues like immigration, and her saying, ‘I’ll follow the law’ on several issues rather than saying what her actual position was,” Halperin added. “I thought, if you’re a voter who thinks she’s vague, she’s not offering explanations and she’s just attacking Donald Trump. I think … that made it a weak interview.”

Trump currently has narrow leads over Harris in six of the seven swing states, with the vice president only slightly leading in Wisconsin, according to RealClearPolling averages.

Former President Bill Clinton’s one-time pollster Doug Schoen on Wednesday asserted the interview indicated that the “Harris campaign really doesn’t have a closing message or strategy.”

“I don’t think it helped at all. I think she felt she’d reach some swing voters,” Schoen added. “But to me, the absence of clear answers, the real sense of, you know, confusion to perfectly logical questions that Bret asked, to me suggests that it underscored all of the issues and concerns that few undecided swing voters have. Don’t think it helped a bit.”

CNN’s Van Jones asserted Thursday that Harris “did a magnificent job” in the interview, but that it was “an inkblot test.”

“If you like Kamala, you’re going to like it more, if you don’t, you’re going to like it less,” Jones said.

A black voter at a Detroit barbershop said in a segment aired on Fox News Thursday morning that he was backing former President Donald Trump this November, citing high prices and the wider Biden-Harris economy.

Trump has made major inroads with black voters, eating away at Vice President Kamala Harris’ hold on the voting bloc. The voter mentioned prices at the grocery store to justify his vote to “Fox and Friends” co-host Lawrence Jones, noting that buying basic household goods feels like “making a life decision” under the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: Bill Maher Rips Democrats Over Walz, Obama Courting Black Voters)

WATCH:



“At the end of the day, I’m Trump because my eyes are open. I can see that he was doing a lot better than what we’re going through right now,” one black voter said in the “Fox and Friends” statement. “You can’t even go to the grocery stores right now without making a life decision on what you want to get. You know, you got to compromise. We don’t have to go through that four years ago.”

Since Biden and Harris took office in January 2021, prices rose by over 20%, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a high of 9% in June 2022. By comparison, the CPI grew 1.4% year-over-year in January 2021, when Trump left office, while the average price for a gallon of gas was under $2.25, according to GasBuddy.com.

Biden, Harris and Democrats have blamed big corporations for higher prices, saying they are the result of “corporate greed.” Harris proposed empowering the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to impose “harsh penalties” for “price gouging” by grocery stores, during an Aug. 16 speech on economic policy that drew criticism from Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell and the paper’s editorial board.

“You know, just being able to just live on a day-to-day basis, it has become a little harder at this point in time,” a second black voter said.

Democrats are scrambling to address Trump’s surge in support from black voters. Trump, who garnered 12% support from black voters in 2020, exceeded that level of support in some general election polls, including a CNN poll released in late September that showed Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump by 55% among black voters under the age of 60, compared to a 71% margin for President Joe Biden in 2020.

Former President Barack Obama spoke at a Pittsburgh-area campaign office for the vice president Oct. 10, where he urged black men to support Harris, while appearing to accuse them of sexism for being hesitant to do so.

Trump leads Harris by 1.0% in polls of Michigan voters from Sept. 21 to Oct. 9, according to the RealClearPolling average. Trump’s lead drops to 0.3% when independent candidate Cornel West, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are included as options in the surveys.

Several Democrats running for key Senate seats have distanced themselves from Vice President Kamala Harris and her bid for the presidency as polling continues to tighten between her and former President Donald Trump.

Democrats such as Texas Rep. Colin Allred, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Montana Sen. Jon Tester have been largely quiet about Harris’s bid for President or have even skipped campaign events for Harris in their own states.

Allred, who is running against Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, appears to be trying to keep Harris at an arms length. He did not appear with Harris during any of her half-dozen visits to Texas around July and the beginning of August. Allred’s first endorsement of Harris, which came from his account on Twitter, was described as “cautious and unclear” and focused primarily on President Joe Biden’s legacy.

During their debate Tuesday, Allred did not mention Harris’s name once, despite Cruz frequently tying their records together.

In Texas, a Morning Consult poll conducted between Oct. 6 and Oct. 15 shows Harris polling at 46% and Allred polling at 45%.

Macarena Martinez, Cruz campaign spokeswoman, told the Daily Caller: “Colin Allred is Kamala Harris. Just like her, he supports boys competing in girls’ sports, open borders, leniency for criminals, and waging war on American energy. It’s long been said that as Texas goes, so goes the nation and a Senator Colin Allred would destroy our State and Country as we know it.”

Tester has gone a step further, refusing to endorse Harris for President despite recruiting her to run for Senate as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) in 2015. Tester has said his vote will be private and has thanked Biden for his public service and for endorsing an open nomination process.

“That’s between me and the ballot box,” Tester said earlier in October after being asked if he would vote for Harris.

The strategy seems to at least be helping: In Montana, a New York Times poll conducted from Oct. 5 through Oct. 8 shows Harris polling at 40% compared to Tester at 44%.

Brown, who is in a tight race in Ohio, has not yet campaigned with Harris and refused to say in July whether he would, insisting their races were separate. (RELATED: Kamala Close With Dem Who Tried To Make Child Porn Possession A Non-Felony)

“I have not thought that through. I endorsed the vice president. But my job is my job. My focus lies in me fighting for Ohio and not who’s running for president,” Brown said in response to a question about campaigning with Harris.

In August, Brown said that he and Kamala Harris have their own schedules, and his focus is on his race.

“I don’t — I have not — I mean, I have not. I’ve got my own schedule. She’s got her own schedule. I will focus on my race. My strategy is perhaps different from her,” Brown said.

An Ohio Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 6 through Oct. 15 shows Harris polling at 45% compared to Brown at 46%.

“All of these Democrats rushed out of the gate to endorse Kamala Harris and have voted with her 100% of the time, so it is funny that they are now trying to create distance from her,” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Communications Director Mike Berg told the Daily Caller.

The Caller contacted Allred, Tester and Brown’s offices about their lack of support for Harris, to which they did not immediately respond.
Angel Mom Patty Morin, whose 37-year-old daughter Rachel Morin was murdered, allegedly by an illegal alien MS-13 gang member, says Vice President Kamala Harris’s apology to Angel Families “is hollow” because she says the administration failed to protect American citizens from illegal immigration.

On Wednesday evening, in a sit-down interview with Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier, Harris was confronted with the murders of Rachel Morin in Maryland, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray in Texas, and 22-year-old Laken Riley in Georgia.

“Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley — they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before the negotiated bipartisan bill,” Baier told Harris:

So if it wouldn’t have happened — this is well before any negotiation, this is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics — this is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I’m saying to you is, do you owe those families an apology? [Emphasis added]

Harris responded, saying “First of all, those are tragic cases.”

“There’s no question about that. There’s no question about that and I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred,” Harris continued:

So that is true. It is also true that if a border security [bill] had been passed nine months ago, nine months that we would have had more Border agents at the border … to ensure that no future harm would occur. This election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election because there was a solution, Bret. [Emphasis added]

In response, Patty Morin told Breitbart News that Harris’s apology rings hollow to Angel Families.

“Vice President Harris had one job, secure our border, and she fell asleep at the switch. Her apology is hollow to us and all the other families that have been victims of illegal immigrant crime,” Morin said:

The fact is, the Biden-Harris Administration rolled back border policies that would have prevented a flood of illegal immigrants, including the man who murdered my daughter. Rachel would still be alive today if they had taken action. It is too late for words. We need accountability, not excuses.

[Emphasis added]

Patty Morin said that even though Harris signed an oath to protect Americans, she has failed, noting that she puts partial blame on Harris for her daughter’s accused killer having been allowed to enter the U.S.

“Vice President Harris swore an oath to protect Americans when she took office, but she failed — not only in her duty but in her moral responsibility to safeguard the lives of those she promised to defend, leaving families like ours shattered and betrayed,” Patty Morin said:

She allowed my daughter’s alleged killer to enter this country, and now countless American families will suffer unending pain as the result of illegal immigrant crimes. She has had three and a half years of opportunities to make a difference, and now she’s asking for more time to keep failing at the job she’s already neglected for too long. [Emphasis added]

In the cases of Rachel Morin, Jocelyn Nungaray, and Laken Riley, illegal aliens are charged with their brutal murders.

The illegal aliens in Nungaray and Riley’s cases were released into the United States interior as part of President Joe Biden and Harris’s expansive Catch and Release network at the southern border.

In Morin’s case, the illegal alien charged with her murder successfully crossed the border undetected by Border Patrol agents under Biden and Harris’s watch — joining the more than two million “got-aways” who are now in the U.S., but the federal government does not know who they are.

Prosecutors have called Morin’s murder the most horrific case ever in the state’s history.

Former President Bill Clinton’s one-time pollster Doug Schoen raised alarm Wednesday on Fox News about Vice President Kamala Harris’s ability to maintain Democratic strongholds in the upcoming elections.

During an appearance on “The Ingraham Angle,” Schoen highlighted significant vulnerabilities in what is traditionally considered the Democratic “blue wall” — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Laura Ingraham opened the discussion by asking Schoen for his perspective on Harris, pointing out that the internal divisions within the party so close to election day were a troubling sign for the vice president.

“It’s, in fact, Laura, you’re absolutely right, a very bad sign. I’m picking up from my Democratic friends and sources precisely what you’re reporting. The so-called blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania is eroding for the Democrats,” Schoen told Ingraham. “There is a level of disorganization on the ground and incoherence vis-à-vis the messaging that is clear.”

He also criticized Harris’s performance in an interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier, suggesting it reflected broader campaign issues. “The Harris campaign really doesn’t have a closing message or strategy, as we, I think, saw in Brett Baier’s interview with Kamala Harris today,” Schoen said.

Ingraham pressed the issue of Harris’s plans, particularly when it came to the economy, pointing out that the vice president still struggled to offer a concrete answer beyond directing voters to her website.

WATCH:

“There is not a clear sense as to what she’s going to do different than Joe Biden, which, as you point out, close to 60% of America has made them feel worse off. She hasn’t articulated a coherent plan,” Schoen explained. “And it’s, frankly, perfectly logical that she would say different times, different circumstances, different plan, here’s what I’m doing, here’s what Trump’s doing, vote for me. She hasn’t done it. And I don’t have a sense, Laura. She’s going to do it.”

“I don’t think it helped at all. I think she felt she’d reach some swing voters. But to me, the absence of clear answers, the real sense of, you know, confusion to perfectly logical questions that Bret asked, to me suggests that it underscored all of the issues and concerns that few undecided swing voters have. Don’t think it helped a bit,” Schoen said when Ingraham asked him whether the Fox interview could have helped Harris.

Schoen mentioned last week that Donald Trump’s rising popularity among minority voters could fracture the Democrats’ grip on key battleground states. Schoen stressed that if Pennsylvania shifts toward Trump, it could be the tipping point that ends the race decisively.

A poll from Michigan News Source and MIRS shows Trump leading in Michigan, pushing his chances of winning the Electoral College to 58.8% against Harris. This represents a notable shift from the previously close contests in this key battleground, as reported by The New York Times and Siena College in September.

With Vice President Kamala Harris’s blundering interview with Fox News on full display, CBS News’ apparent decision to selectively edit its own interview to be more flattering of the presidential hopeful looks even more damning.

Harris has only done a handful of interviews as the Democrat replacement nominee for president, and all but the one with Fox News anchor Bret Baier have been done with media allies of Harris and her ideological ilk. A lot of them have been pretaped, giving outlets the ability to edit the footage.

Last week, CBS put on one of the most blatant attempts to deceive the American people by releasing one, and then a second totally different, answer to the same question. In the first version, Harris shared what has been widely mocked as a lengthy “word salad” answer to “60 Minutes” interviewer Bill Whitaker’s question about Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strained relationship with the White House.

The “word salad,” however, did not make it into the edit that aired in the full interview, as it was replaced by a shorter, more succinct answer that did not appear in the first clip. The switcheroo, which appeared to be nothing less than corporate media election interference, earned scorn and even a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) complaint accusing CBS of “significant and intentional news distortion.”

“This isn’t just about one interview or one network,” Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, which filed the complaint, said in a statement. “This is about the public’s trust in the media on critical issues of national security and international relations during one of the most consequential elections of our time.”

“When broadcasters manipulate interviews and distort reality, it undermines democracy itself. The FCC must act swiftly to restore public confidence in our news media,” Suhr added.

CBS and the FCC’s Democrat chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel defended the selective editing, with “60 Minutes” correspondent Jon Wertheim saying that “things are edited in every story.” Rosenworcel came more forcefully to the defense of CBS, attacking former President Donald Trump’s criticism of the edits, saying, “While repeated attacks against broadcast stations by the former President may now be familiar, these threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored.”

The vast majority of Americans (85 percent) believe CBS should release the full interview, according to a Harvard/Harris poll.

A little more than a week after Harris’s CBS interview, her Fox News interview on Wednesday showed the American people exactly what kind of performance the CBS editors were apparently trying to hide. She was combative and angry at receiving pushback from the press, as the interview showed an unadulterated display of her inability to articulate her own positions, much less how they differ from the policies of the disastrous Biden administration.

Baier asked Harris normal, journalistic questions and Fox published the interview in its entirety. That did not stop the Harris campaign from quickly blasting it as an “ambush,” in the words of Harris senior adviser and former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.

On countless occasions in the Fox interview, Harris appeared irritated that she was being asked basic questions about the administration in which she currently serves and about her changing policy positions. She also refused to answer the questions, invoking Trump at each opportunity to the point where Baier was forced to try to re-focus Harris on answering the actual questions posed.

One of the several issues Baier asked about that Harris has flip-flopped on was her position supporting decriminalizing illegal border crossings, which she expressed during her 2019 run for president. She now says she does not support that and “will not do that as president,” despite the fact that with her as “border czar” the Biden administration has allowed an unprecedented surge of illegal border crossings.

When asked about the repercussions of her administration’s open border policy, like the deaths of innocent Americans at the hands of illegals dumped by the Biden-Harris administration into American communities, Harris offered a mealy-mouthed and dismissive apology. Instead of taking responsibility, she merely said she was sorry that the deaths occurred.

Harris invoked a bill killed in Congress in an attempt to shift blame to Republicans for not passing immigration reform, but, as Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida pointed out, the bill would have allowed nearly two million illegal aliens into the country every year and codified leftist policies by funding sanctuary cities, lawyers for the illegals, NGOs involved in transporting them, and would not have deported them, among many other things.

Why the Senate Border Deal FAILED:



1–Codify Catch/Release

2–Let in 1.8M Illegals

3–Fund Sanctuary Cities

4–Fund NGOs Moving Illegals

5–Lawyers to Illegals

6–Work Permits to Illegals

7–Nothing to Deport Illegals

8–No Immediate Wall Funds

9–Weak Asylum Screening

10–$60B to Ukraine pic.twitter.com/GfKrNqbaPF — Byron Donalds (@ByronDonalds) October 16, 2024

When Harris repeatedly tried to claim that Trump is “not stable,” Baier turned the premise on its head, asking Harris an extremely obvious question: when did she “first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?”

Harris deflected, exasperated, telling Baier that Biden, who is still serving as president, “is not on the ballot.”

Of the few interviews Harris has done, her sit-down with Fox has been the only one with an interviewer who is not a dyed-in-the-wool ally of the far left. And it showed, as Harris angrily sputtered under mildly challenging questions.

In response, the leftist media outlets that have worked overtime to cover for Harris’ shortcomings rushed to paint the Fox interview as something outside media norms.

Miraculously, many corporate media outlets — the Associated Press, NPR, CNN, the Guardian, and more — came out with matching headlines to help pad the Harris campaign’s disastrous showing, using the word “testy” to describe the Fox interview.

CNN’s Brian Stelter went further, saying Harris “walked into a Trump campaign field office” at Fox and describing Baier as a “Trump surrogate” in an attempt to explain away Harris’ incoherence.

Apparently the Harris campaign agrees with this assessment: https://t.co/IwmFsS37XC — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 17, 2024

Stelter boasted on social media that the Harris campaign agrees with him.

The Biden administration and Kamala Harris campaign are reportedly worried that the ongoing Middle East conflict hasn’t calmed down ahead of the U.S. presidential elections in November, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

The conflict in the Middle East began between Israel and Hamas last October but has since expanded into the broader region and drawn other actors in, including Iran and Hezbollah. The Biden-Harris administration has been pushing for regional de-escalation and a ceasefire in the hopes the conflict would end around election time, but that hasn’t come to fruition — and now the Harris campaign has grown nervous that it will affect Democratic voter turnout on election day, U.S. and campaign officials told the Post. (RELATED: Blinken Reportedly Holding Back On Presenting Post-Gaza War Plan Until After Election)

“It’s a huge concern. It comes down to people saying, ‘I can’t support anyone who supports a genocide,’” a Harris campaign official told the Post, using a disputed term to describe Israel’s actions against Hamas in Gaza.

Biden-Harris officials have worked tirelessly for months to try to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but that effort has failed as neither side has seemed interested in a deal. Israeli forces have also recently expanded their military operations against Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based terrorist group that has been attacking Israel since last year.

Israel has similarly traded blows with Iran, which launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles into Israeli territory on Oct. 1. Israel is expected to launch retaliatory strikes sometime in the coming weeks, according to CNN.

The Biden-Harris administration’s ability to maneuver or exert pressure on the conflict has only seemed to become more limited as it has dragged on, and officials are now looking back on what they could have done differently, they told the Post.

“What we did had the effect of endorsing Israel’s military campaign before understanding whether Israel had a viable exit strategy,” Andrew Miller, a former State Department official who recently left his role, told the Post. “I don’t think there’s anyone in the administration who could say with a straight face Israel had a clearly defined end-state.”

The Harris campaign has become worried about losing Democratic support over the conflict and the continued U.S. support of Israel, officials told the Post. The concerns are especially deep in Michigan, a crucial swing state with a high Muslim and Arab population.

Harris’ advisers initially believed that the vice president had distanced herself far enough from Biden’s approach to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — given that she has seemingly been more sympathetic to the Palestinian issue and sterner toward the Israeli government — which they hoped would translate to more support from Muslim and Arab demographics, according to the Post. But as the conflict has dragged on, it’s been more difficult to garner that support.

And internally, there’s reportedly doubt among top Biden officials that they can move the needle towards regional de-escalation before Biden leaves office.

“No deal is imminent,” one U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal in September. “I’m not sure it ever gets done.”

The Harris campaign and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The election is finally shaping up to be not only liberal Democrat Kamala Harris versus conservative Republican Donald Trump.

Instead, it has become a larger contest between those who talk down to their fellow Americans and those who are increasingly sick and tired of being lectured. How smart is it, for example, for Harris supporters to claim nonstop that ex-president Trump is a fascist dictator — and thus, by extension, those also who vote for him?

Women voters poll about 53-5 percent for Harris. Trump enjoys a similar, although likely somewhat smaller, majority margin of male voters.

Yet Harris — along with campaign surrogates Barack Obama and Bill Clinton — has been lecturing both black and white male voters nonstop that they are misled.

Or they supposedly suffer from false consciousness — as if they have no clue that Harris and her progressive agenda are really in their own self-interest.

Such haughtiness reached a zenith when Harris ran ads of actors costumed as supposedly working-class men. They voiced scripted talking points to prove that “real” men were progressive Harris supporters.

But the actors were so patently ridiculous, their canned lines so unreal, that most viewers likely thought the ads were run by Trump himself — to show how arrogant, out-of-touch elites must imagine how the so-called “clingers” and “deplorables” think and talk.

The Trump campaign also tries all sorts of strategies to win over women voters, from promising to rectify the Biden-Harris hyperinflation to reducing spiraling crime in towns and cities.

But one method they avoid is claiming women are ignorant of their real self-interest and deluded by Harris — accurately assuming that a candidate does not win voters by belittling their intelligence.

Harris and Obama both dressed down black men, claiming they were especially culpable for not voting en masse for Harris — even though a far higher percentage of black males will vote for Harris than for Trump.

This hectoring the electorate on its supposed ignorance or moral shortcomings has become a Harris campaign trademark.

To Harris, objecting to 10-12 million foreign nationals entering the country illegally without background checks during the Biden-Harris administration is supposedly a sign of a lack of compassion.

And claiming that a current declining rate of illegal immigration should allay voters’ supposed paranoias utterly ignores the millions of illegal aliens who were all but welcomed in by Biden-Harris before the 2024 election cycle.

Voters are also talked down to ad nauseam that they do not appreciate the Biden-Harris economy given the rate of inflation is falling.

True. But most voters go shopping in a manner politicians do not.

So, they resent such top-down sermons. They know best that prices for staple foods, fuel, insurance and housing have spiked by some 20-30% since 2021 — and stayed astronomically high.

Currently, the auto industry is in crisis. Its huge inventory of electric vehicles sits unwanted and unsold. Harris and the left, remember, mandated all sorts of EV standards in their war against the internal combustion engine.

Then the proverbial people revolted against the comparatively limited range of EVs and the difficulty in finding accessible and quick-charging stations.

So, the free market and consumer demand ignored the increasingly strident lectures.

Likewise, Harris pontificated that crime that had spiked in 2021-2023 is now not all that bad.

But voters know all too well that their major cities are now unsafe. They sense one reason this year that crime is not soaring as it was two years ago is because it had gotten so bad that any further commensurate increases would have made life utterly unlivable.

The Harris campaign was further hurt by past videos that keep popping up of Harris lecturing voters about how they either must think correctly or remain cluelessly selfish or ignorant.

So, a recent clip surfaced on Columbus Day 2021 of a Vice President Harris lecturing America about Western civilization’s “shameful” sins in discovering the new world.

Another video reveals Harris warning the country in 2020 on national television that the massive post-George Floyd demonstrations — that had turned violent and deadly — were not and should not stop, as if the country had to pay collective penance for its sins.

This 2024 race may be becoming analogous to an October 1980 teachable moment.

Then a preachy and sanctimonious incumbent Jimmy Carter — ahead in the final October polls over challenger Ronald Reagan — finally turned off voters for good.

The previous underdog Reagan won in a landslide for a variety of reasons. But certainly, one explanation was that the electorate had finally collectively shrugged off their weariness. They were sick and tired of Carter’s downer lectures about how they were wrong and culpable.

Reagan, however, reminded voters that America was better than all the alternatives, needed not be perfect to be good and had nothing to apologize for.

The same contrast will likely determine the election of 2024.

If 75% of the roughly 200,000 Muslim Americans in Michigan cast their vote on November 5, Vice President Kamala Harris will be virtually guaranteed to lose the state and its critical 15 electoral votes.

That’s what one activist group in the state, Drive for 75, believes. And to achieve it, Rex Nazarko and his organization are barnstorming mosques, hosting voter promotion sermons and knocking on thousands of doors across the state.

“What was a guarantee for [a Harris loss] to happen? We tried with different percentages and different turnouts, and with the 75% number, again, accounting only for the Muslim community, not other communities, not other allies, not other progressives. It essentially guaranteed a 99.9% likelihood of the vice president losing the election in Michigan, if 75% of [the community turned out],” Nazarko told the Caller, explaining that they ran numerous mathematical simulations to inform their strategy.

“We ran that simulation 10,000 times, and almost every time that was the case. So that’s how we got the Drive for 75 call to action and idea,” he explained.

Though Harris hasn’t faced nearly as many pro-Palestinian protestors as President Joe Biden, efforts to thwart the Democrats’ presidential aspirations haven’t disappeared. Muslim Americans told the Daily Caller they are working to push their community to vote for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, or even in some cases former President Donald Trump, in an effort to hold Harris accountable for how she and Biden have handled the Israel-Hamas war.

“[The Muslim American community] lost their faith in the Democratic Party and the Democratic administration, so they’re out to kind of hold them accountable. And I don’t want to necessarily say punish, but it is also a punishment vote, in a sense. I think that they’re desperate. We’re desperate. It’s also a vote of desperation. You know, we want to see an end to this bloodshed and this genocide as soon as possible,” Nazarko told the Caller.

The Michiganders who spoke to the Caller acknowledged Trump might not have the Israel-Gaza policy the community hopes to see, but their effort is more focused on punishing the current administration than about who they could vote into office. The movement is also about sending a message to politicians that their voice cannot be ignored, Democrat Khalid Turaani, co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in Michigan, told the Caller. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)

“We’re hoping that, whether Republicans or Democrats, will not take our vote for granted. So if it is [spoiling Harris’s chances], I hope it teaches not only the Democrats but the Republicans that, you go against your voters, you go against people as well. You continue to support a genocide, you’re going to lose,” Turaani told the Caller.

Before Biden dropped out of the race for the White House, his primary victory was stunted by a large protest vote across several key swing states, including Michigan. Campaigns like “Abandon Biden” pushed Arab and Muslim Americans to vote for the “uncommitted” ballot option in protest of his Gaza policy. And while 81.1% of Democratic primary voters chose Biden, 13.3% — more than 100,000 people — chose the uncommitted option.

In light of Biden exiting the presidential race, Abandon Biden switched its name to Abandon Harris, even though the vice president has indicated she would be tougher on Israel than her boss.

“She parrots the same line of ‘well on Oct. 7’ and okay, there has been more than 50,000 deaths. Two-thirds of them are women and children and she can’t get past ‘well on October 7.’ And we feel that this callous disregard to the lives of Palestinian civilians and the destruction of not only their infrastructure, the entire place in Gaza has been decimated, and and she just continues to parrot the same line. Meanwhile, continuing to support the Israeli assault and the Palestinian civilians and their lives and their buildings and their every aspect of their lives is under assault,” Turaani told the Caller.

“This administration represented by Biden and Harris continues to support that. The other thing is the fact that every effort to stop the genocide has been thwarted by this administration,” Turaani continued.

To cost Harris the state, not every Muslim American is expected to vote for Trump. In fact, some groups told the Caller they expect the community to not vote for either. Just five days ago, Abandon Harris threw its support behind Stein, who also has the backing of some socialist groups in the U.S due to her anti-capitalist economic positioning. And the Green Party seems to know its bid could spoil Harris’ candidacy.

Not fighting to punish Harris for her support for the genocide is disastrous strategy for the antiwar movement. Trump is absolutely not an alternative. But a sitting Vice Pres backing genocide needs to pay the price. The message is for both Dems & Reps. Genocide is a red line. — Kshama Sawant (@cmkshama) October 10, 2024



“We need to be clear about what our goals are, we are not in a position to win the White House. But we do have a real opportunity to win something historic. We could deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan,” Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council Member and self-described socialist, said to cheers at a recent rally for Stein.

A spokesperson for the Stein campaign referred the Caller to Abandon Harris’s endorsement, adding that it “outlines Muslim support for the campaign.”

“We’ve conducted an internal informal poll, we’ve cross-referenced with other polls taken in the state and nationwide, and we’ve been speaking to thousands of community members for the past weeks. The sentiment seems either Jill Stein or third-party, and then Trump and then Harris is at the very bottom. So if we just get the community out, we know that the natural distribution of both is going to fall towards that third party,” Nazarko told the Caller.

Vice chair of the 12th Congressional District Republican Committee, Stephanie Butler, who lives in Dearborn and is married to a Muslim, told the Caller that a deciding moment for the Muslim community in Michigan was former Vice President Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Harris.

“Here’s the new thing going around, people are saying that, ‘hello, she’s been endorsed by Dick Cheney.’ That tells you everything you need to know about this woman: that her intentions are war,” Butler told the Caller.

But a few weeks out from the election, some are still worried that the community may choose to stay home rather than go out to vote amid their anger.

“I feel like a majority of Muslims will vote for Jill Stein. There are a small portion that will vote for Trump,” Hassan Chami, a Dearborn resident, told the Caller. “The issue is, I fear that a lot of people may not want to vote at all. And if that’s the case, Kamala maybe can win Michigan.”

To address the concerns, Drive for 75 is blitzing the Muslim community. The effort currently has a civic representative and team captains assigned to each mosque that are building a sub team of volunteers and who each will be responsible for providing materials and election updates to 50 contacts within the community. Currently the plan is being implemented in 25 mosques, but will be expanded into more.

Within those mosques and other community centers, Drive for 75 is hosting turn out the vote events and using social media and text messages to push Muslim Americans to the polls. In the final two weeks of the election cycle, Drive for 75 expects to knock on 10,000 doors.

“Muslims are family-oriented and family-centered. We’re relying on the large networks that community members have to encourage one another,” Nazarko told the Caller.

Though polls show the race neck-and-neck in the state, there is a confidence among the community about what to expect.

“There’s no way [Harris] can win Michigan,” Butler told the Caller. “There’s just no way.”
The Biden administration announced Thursday it is racing to cancel student loans for more than 60,000 public service workers. The move comes just 18 days before the 2024 election and brings the number of public service workers who have now benefitted from such taxpayer-funded largesse to over one million.

The gift delivers $4.5 billion in debt relief to teachers, firefighters, and other service workers who have been dutifully meeting loan repayment obligations for over a decade, the Hill reports.

The administration claims fixes it has made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program over the past four years has made the windfall possible, which has resulted in upwards of one million public service workers seeing loan forgiveness, costing some $175 billion, the Hill report states.

RELATED: Journalist Asks KJP — Why Are Borrowers “Due” Loan Forgiveness?

C-SPAN

Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the move makes good on an administration promise:

Before President Biden and Vice President Harris entered the White House, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was so riddled by dysfunction that just 7,000 Americans ever qualified, and countless public servants were trapped making payments on debts that should have been forgiven. From Day One, the Biden-Harris administration made fixing this broken program a top priority, and today, I’m tremendously proud that over one million teachers, nurses, social workers, veterans, and other public servants have received lifechanging loan forgiveness.

The loan forgiveness comes weeks before the election, with officials giving no indication if borrowers can expect more debt relief in Biden’s last few months in office.

Unlike other debt relief programs the Biden administration has attempted, this forgiveness is unlikely to be challenged in court as it is based on a different authority that is more difficult to fight.

Back in May the White House issued a statement announcing some 160,000 people in the United States would have their student loans canceled, erasing a total of $7.7 billion in student debt for those people, as Breitbart News reported.

Biden’s latest announcement comes after he announced in April that his administration would be canceling student debt for more than 270,000 people.

Those who had their student debt canceled in April were borrowers who were enrolled in Biden’s SAVE Plan.

Republicans call the Democratic president’s student loan forgiveness an overreach of authority and an unfair benefit to college-educated borrowers while others receive no such relief as they fulfill their commitments to paying back their loans in full.
Former President Donald Trump ripped the Biden-Harris administration for the nation's illegal immigration crisis during a town hall event with undecided Hispanic voters, arguing that Hispanic voters "are most against" illegal migration across the border.

"We have to have a lot of people come into our country. We just want them to come in legally through a system, because [the Biden-Harris administration] released hundreds of thousands of people that are murderers, drug dealers, terrorists. They're coming in totally, nobody knows who they are, where they come from, and the people that are most against it are the Hispanic people," Trump said in the event that aired Wednesday evening.

"They are totally against it," he added, after he was asked by a Spanish-speaking voter who would occupy farm and produce jobs if illegal immigrants are deported under his administration.

"Noticias Univision Presenta: Los Latinos Preguntan … Donald Trump Responde" aired at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, spotlighting immigration, the economy, and Trump defending his previous administration in the hour-long pre-recorded event. The town hall, which was hosted by Televisa anchor Enrique Acevedo, is the second held by Univision this election cycle, after hosting Vice President Kamala Harris last week.

One Republican voter who resides in the battleground state of Arizona questioned Trump about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, asking the 45th president if he believes the migrants are eating cats and dogs, as he has previously cited on the campaign trail and during his presidential debate against Harris.

Trump said he will travel to Springfield and provide "a full report" after his visit.

INEFFECTIVE PLANNING, LACK OF CONNECTIONS HAS DEMS ON EDGE IN 'KEY' BATTLEGROUND: REPORT

"I was just saying what was reported, that's been reported. And eating other things, too, that they're not supposed to be. But this is, all I do is report. … I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look and I'll give you a full report when I do. But that's been in the newspapers and reported pretty broadly," Trump responded.

"I will say this, as far as Springfield is concerned, because I do know that situation. You have a city of 52,000 people, and they've added almost 30,000 migrants into the city. If you were a person that lived there, if you lived in Springfield, Ohio, and all of a sudden you couldn't get into a hospital, you couldn't get your children into a school, you wouldn't be able to buy groceries. You can no longer pay the rent because the government's paying rent," he continued. "….If any of that happened, it would be a disaster for you."

Polling published this month found Vice President Kamala Harris has an edge over Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in two key battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, but Trump has made gains among younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today polls.

A Fox News poll published Wednesday found that Harris received majority support among Hispanics, at 52%, and voters under age 30, at 54%, however, those stats trail President Biden’s support in 2020, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis election survey. That poll overall found Trump has a two-point average over Harris overall, which is a reversal from last month, when Harris had a narrow advantage.

While in Florida, various recent polling found Trump leading Harris among Hispanic voters, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday.

Trump continued fielding various questions from audience members, including one female full-time student in Florida who asked how he plans to tackle the spiraling national debt, which is worrying her.

"We have record national debt. We've never had anything like it before. We were getting ready to start paying down debt, and then we got hit with a thing called COVID, or the China virus," he responded.

"What's going to solve the problem is growth. It's a thing called growth that nobody even talks about from the Democrat standpoint, because they don't know about growth. But we're going to bring companies in. We're going to bring tremendous business to our country, and that's going to solve that. Also, waste, fraud and abuse. And we have Elon Musk, who's a fantastic guy and a fantastic genius. He's a genius at a lot of things, but he's a great business person," he explained, citing his plan to make tech billionaire Elon Musk the "secretary of cost-cutting" if he's re-elected.

TRUMP OUTPERFORMING 2020 SUPPORT AMONG HISPANICS, WHO PREFER HIM ON IMMIGRATION, POLL SHOWS

A stay-at-home mom from North Carolina asked Trump if he agreed with his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, on her pro-choice abortion stance in her new memoir that suggested a woman's right to choose an abortion is a "fundamental right of individual liberty."

NEW POLL SHOWS WHO HISPANICS ARE BACKING IN SOUTHWEST SWING STATES

"First of all, I told Melania that she has to go with her heart and she has to do what she has to do. She has to support what she wants to support. And she wrote a great book. It was just, it's the number one bestseller. I hope you all go out and buy it, but it's really a great book. But I want her to do what she wants to do. I wouldn't be one to oppose what I think," he responded.

"They wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade and let it come back to the States. And I've done that," he added on abortion. "And now the people are voting on it, and you're going to see it's going to heal. It will never heal. It would have never healed if it stayed in Congress, if it stayed in the federal government. It's now in the states. The people are voting as we speak. The people are voting. Some states have completed – like Kansas, Ohio, and a lot of others. But,, it's going to settle a problem that was only going to get more divisive, divisive and worse. It was a big, big dispute for a long period of time."

Fox News host Sean Hannity calls out Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric ahead of the 2024 presidential election on " Hannity ."

SEAN HANNITY: Desperate times call for desperate measures at the Harris campaign. Only hours ago, Kamala Harris sat down for a very tough live-to-tape interview right here on the Fox News Channel with our very own Bret Baier. Now, unlike the pro-Kamala Harris, state-run fake news media and other people who call themselves journalists, he asked tough, fair questions.

TRUMP TAKES DETOUR TO ULTRA-BLUE CALIFORNIA TO SPOTLIGHT HARRIS' HOME TURF'S FAILED POLICIES: 'PARADISE LOST'

He insisted on real answers in a short period of time, a short window that they gave him about very important topics. He didn't let Harris off the hook. He pressed her. He pressed her repeatedly. Needless to say, I'd say the joy is gone in the Harris campaign tonight and her obvious anger, that was on full display, the one she's notorious for. Kamala Harris appeared agitated, obsessively trying to simply avoid answering basic fundamental questions.

Former President Donald Trump took the dais at the 79th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday evening, cracking jokes and taking shots at Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping the bipartisan political event that typically adds a bit of levity to the campaign trail each presidential election cycle.

"If you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis, and she would have been here, guaranteed. She would have been guaranteed," Trump quipped of Harris' absence on Thursday, citing her promotion of a bail fund during the riots of 2020.

Trump and former first lady Melania Trump were welcomed to the event just after 8 p.m., with Trump shaking hands with other high-profile guests, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. Comedian Jim Gaffigan served as the emcee of this year's dinner.

"I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. I'd really hoped that you would come, because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy," Trump joked at another point of Harris.

HARRIS TO VIRTUALLY ATTEND CATHOLIC CHARITY DINNER THAT RIVAL TRUMP IS HEADLINING

The Al Smith dinner was launched in 1946, and has raised millions of dollars for charities supporting women and children. It has since grown to become a political and cultural hallmark of election seasons. The dinner is named after the first Catholic presidential candidate, Al Smith, who served as the 42nd governor of New York. He ran for president as a Democrat in 1928.

Other attendees of the event include, Attorney General Letitia James – an outspoken critic of Trump who slammed him as a "con man" while campaigning for the AG job in 2018 – former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Gov. Kathy Hochul and others.

This year's Al Smith dinner, however, was set to be a bit different from previous years, as Vice President Kamala Harris skipped the in-person event, sending a pre-recorded video instead. The 2020 Al Smith dinner was also different from previous election years, as it was held virtually amid the pandemic's lockdowns and social distancing requirements.

Harris' provided a video of herself, and was joined by former "Saturday Night Live" cast member Molly Shannon as the character of Catholic student Mary Katherine Gallagher.

"So tell me something, I’m giving a speech. Do you have some thoughts about what I might say tonight?" Harris asked Shannon in the video.

"Don’t lie. Thou shall not bear false witness to thy neighbor," Shannon responded.

"Indeed, especially thy neighbor’s election results," Harris joked.

Harris' snub of the historic Catholic charity event irked New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, the host of the dinner, on his podcast earlier this week.

"This year will be imbalanced because sadly, Kamala Harris isn't coming," Dolan said on his podcast Tuesday. "It's a shame because the nature of the evening is to bring people together. The nature of the evening is civility, patriotism, humor. It's not a campaign speech. It's not a campaign stop."

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on sending a pre-recorded video message for the event, but did not receive a reply. The campaign previously told Fox News that Harris was skipping the event to focus on campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin on Thursday.

KAMALA HARRIS PLANS TO SKIP HISTORIC AL SMITH DINNER DESPITE LONG-STANDING TRADITION

"The Vice President is going to be campaigning in a battleground state that day, and the campaign wants to maximize her time in the battlegrounds this close to the election. Her team also told the organizers that she would very much like to attend their event as President. This would make her one of the first sitting Presidents to attend," the campaign said.

Prior to the event, Trump lambasted Harris on Truth Social for not appearing in-person and suggested it could cost her the Catholic vote.

"Just found out that Lyin’ Kamala is doing a video message tonight instead of being at the Al Smith Dinner. She shouldn’t be allowed to do a video message. Kamala should be there like almost every other Presidential Candidate in their History, except Walter Mondale, who lost 49-1. They didn’t give me the option of a video message, nor would I have done it. This is very disrespectful to everyone involved. She should be here, or lose the Catholic Vote!" Trump posted.

Trump continued in his remarks that he would make some self-deprecating jokes, before saying his critics and opponents have taken shots at him "for a hell of a long time."

"Tradition holds that I'm supposed to tell a few self-deprecating jokes this evening. So here it goes. Nope. I've got nothing. I've got nothing. There's nothing to say. I guess I just don't see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time," he joked.

Trump has attended the event each election year since 2016, when he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traded barbs that drew roaring laughter and some jeers from the crowd.

"It’s great to be here with a thousand wonderful people, or, as I call it, a small intimate dinner with some friends. Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season," Trump quipped during his 2016 remarks.

CARDINAL DOLAN 'UPSET' THAT HARRIS SKIPPING AL SMITH DINNER

"People look at the Statue of Liberty, and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald sees the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4. Maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair," Clinton joked amid her remarks.

Dolan said he anticipates the dinner to raise roughly $9 million, which will be given to various charities to assist women and children in need, as part of the Church's pro-life mission, according to a press release from the foundation.
Over the last year, Fox News correspondents Bill Melguin and Griff Jenkins have been following complaints from Border Patrol sources that many of the crucial remote surveillance cameras in multiple sectors along the southern border have not been operational.

U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee Republicans say whistleblowers came forward to the committee last week, claiming that "some of the busiest Southwest border sectors have nearly 50 or more cameras offline with multiple towers that have been out of service for more than a year."

On Wednesday, the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, claiming that whistleblowers came forward to the committee last week with concerning information on this issue.

The letter from Republicans to Mayorkas demanded answers.

BORDER PATROL FACING LARGE-SCALE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA OUTAGE WITH ‘SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS’: REPORT

Additionally, the committee says the sources claim that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for repairing the cameras, and it has been improperly contracting to companies employing non-US citizens against Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policy "who may be physically manipulating the equipment on the camera towers."

These surveillance cameras are extremely important to Border Patrol for tracking migrant evaders, smugglers, gotaways, and large groups, and having so many of them not working is a big problem for Border Patrol, committee sources said.

"Multiple sources revealed to the Committee last week that more than 66% of the cameras in the remote video surveillance systems upgrade (RVSS-U) program are inoperable. According to these sources, some of the busiest Southwest border sectors have nearly 50 or more cameras offline with multiple towers that have been out of service for more than a year."

In a statement to Fox News, the Border Patrol union said:

"Once again, we have another situation of ineptness from this administration, and it continues to show how out of touch DHS leadership is. Not only does this have an impact on the country by not knowing who or what is coming in, it also impacts the safety of the agents working the front lines," Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council said.

NBC News reported that an October memo said nearly one-third of cameras, roughly 150 of 500 cameras on surveillance towers, were out due to technical issues.

AFGHAN ISIS TERROR PLOT: BIDEN ADMIN AGENCIES POINT FINGERS AS LAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS

"The nationwide issue is having significant impacts on [Border Patrol] operations," the memo said.

The RVSS are nearly 15 years old and are used to monitor areas of the border without the need for regular on the ground patrols. Agents will rely on a variety of detection and surveillance, including AI-powered towers, as well as helicopters, K-9s, the border wall, and the agents themselves.

Agents have noted the helpfulness of the automated surveillance towers , which are more advanced and use AI to track migrants and help agents locate them. CBP has deployed more than 300 of the towers.

Officials say that RVSS is an old, costly system requiring regular maintenance and dedicated staff to monitor the cameras. That is opposed to the newer systems that use AI and provide alerts to agents in real time.

"CBP continues to install newer, more advanced technology that embrace[s] artificial intelligence and machine learning to replace outdated systems, reducing the need to have agents working [on] non-interdiction functions within a local command center."

However, the National Border Patrol Council’s branch in Laredo, Texas, recently highlighted the issues and told agents that it "shares your concerns that inoperable camera towers along the border are causing serious Officer Safety and Border Security concerns."

The report comes as border security remains a top issue ahead of the 2024 election. Both presidential candidates, former President Trump and Vice President Harris, have pledged to provide more funding to the southern border and have been attempting to show voters that they are the stronger candidate for securing it.

Former President Donald Trump is holding a solid lead in the swing state of Georgia, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday.

This survey showed Trump with support from a majority in the Peach State, garnering 52 percent to Vice President Kamala Harris’s 45 percent — a seven-point difference.

For greater perspective, Quinnipiac’s last survey released October 1 showed Trump with 50 percent support to Harris’s 44 percent support — a difference of six percentage points.

The month prior to that, just four percent separated the two, as Trump saw 49 percent to Harris’s 45 percent support.

In other words, the trends are clearly in Trump’s favor.

Further, the survey showed Trump leading among independents in the Peach State with 49 percent support to Harris’s 42 percent.

The survey also showed Trump leading Harris on key issues, such as the economy. Fifty-five percent of respondents in Georgia believe Trump would do a better job on the economy, compared to 43 percent who said Harris.

Trump also leads Harris on the issue of immigration in Georgia by a 16-point margin — 57 percent to the vice president’s 41 percent. Georgia voters also trust Trump more with preserving democracy (51 percent to Harris’s 46 percent), handling an emergency in the United States (53 percent to Harris’s 44 percent), and handling a crisis that puts the country at risk (54 percent to Harris’s 44 percent).

The survey was taken October 10-14, 2024, among 1,328 likely voters in Georgia. It has a +/- 2.7 percent margin of error.

It comes as voters in Georgia break early voting records in terms of turnout in the Peach State, casting over 300,000 ballots on Tuesday. That is more than double the previous record of 136,000 made in 2020, signaling great enthusiasm this election cycle.

Overall, the Trump campaign is feeling good about its prospects in Georgia.

“Since 2020 like 62 percent of the new net voter registrations came from counties that Trump won in 2020 according to the final tally,” James Blair, who is running the political operations for the Trump campaign, explained during an interview on Breitbart News Saturday.

“Again, absentee mail ballot requests are down 80 percent in Georgia — the difference of a little over a million ballots,” he added.

Official results show President Biden winning Georgia in 2020 by less than half of a percentage point.
James O’Keefe claims that a Meta engineer admitted in a candid interview with an undercover journalist with O’Keefe Media Group that Facebook demotes anti-Kamala Harris posts.

Jeevan Gyawali, a senior software engineer with Meta, appeared to reveal in a hidden camera interview that accounts posting anti-Kamala Harris content could be shadowbanned while the posts get demoted.

“Say your uncle in Ohio said something about Kamala Harris is unfit to be a president because she doesn’t have a child, that kind of shit is automatically demoted,” Gyawali appeared to say in the heavily edited video.

Gyawali also appeared to say that the person “would not be notified,” which translates into a shadowban. The poster’s engagement and impressions would likely decrease. He also appeared to talk about Meta’s “Integrity Team” controlling content through something allegedly called “civic classifiers – a system meant to shadowban users.

“There is an integrity team,” he said. “That’s like a pretty significant team and they build all these classifiers.”

Later, he said, “The basic level of defense system that Facebook has built now is … they have built these things called civic classifiers – a large model that has been trained on civic content, so anything that it detects to have a civic content, is like demoted.”

“That means if anything is related to political content, it’s automatically not shown,” he added when asked to define “civic classifiers.”

“There is a SWAT team that’s already set up since April… just to think about all the scenarios of how the platform could be abused,” Gyawali also the undercover journalist.

Gyawali also appeared to admit that Meta has the ability to influence the 2024 election, adding that founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg stands behind that initiative.

As James O’Keefe admitted, the undercover journalist had set up a date with Gyawali on the dating app Bumble, so it remains to be seen if his claims were hard fact or slightly embellished to impress a date showing interest in his trade. O’Keefe claims that when he contacted Gyawali for comment, he responded “ah, fuck” before ending the call.

Meta executive Andy Stone posted a comment to X stating, “Exactly. An “undercover sting,” AKA a date, in which an engineer explained something Meta has been public about for years: we show less political content of all kinds and viewpoints because users have told us they want to see less of it.”

Update — This article has been updated with a comment made by a Meta executive on the video that was posted after publication
Republican operatives in Michigan have signaled optimism about the party’s prospects in the state despite reports the GOP’s ground game has fallen behind its Democratic rivals just weeks before the election.

"I am very optimistic about Michigan… in terms of the ground game, I've never seen this type of ground game in Michigan for a long time," Michigan GOP Chair Pete Hoekstra told Fox News Digital.

The comment comes as the election enters the critical homestretch, with the state of Michigan being at the center of not only the presidential race but also control of both the House and Senate.

Polls show a razor tight race on the presidential side, with former President Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by just one point as of Wednesday, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. According to the Fox News Power Rankings, the race remains a tossup.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE EMERGES

The Senate race in the state between former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., has also tightened significantly in recent weeks, the Real Clear Politics polling average shows, with Slotkin’s lead of 5.1 points on Sept. 23 falling to just 2.7 points as of Wednesday. According to the Fox News Power rankings, the seat currently is in the "Lean Democrat" category.

Meanwhile, Michigan features two House races that are rated as "toss ups" by the Cook Political Report; the 7th Congressional District battle between former Democratic state Sen. Curtis Hertel and former Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett, and the 8th District race between Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet and Republican businessman Paul Junge.

But some have begun to question the Republican ground game in the state despite its importance to the ultimate outcome of the election, including a Politico report at the end of September that declared some within the GOP were starting to "raise alarms" about the Trump campaign’s operation.

"They are out-matching us in money, in enthusiasm and in the ground game," one Michigan-based GOP strategist, who was granted anonymity, told the outlet.

GOP opponents in the state have made similar observations, with Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Aiden Johnson noting that Republicans have outsourced much of their campaign ground work.

"Republicans’ decision to outsource their field operation to a billionaire sycophant has left them with an unmitigated disaster," Johnson told Fox News Digital. "Michigan Democrats have had dedicated organizers on the ground for over a year, actively persuading voters and mobilizing record turnout. It’s not hyperbole to say organizing wins elections."

VP KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT DOWN WITH CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR BRET BAIER FOR FIRST FORMAL FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

Hoekstra, however, disagreed, telling Fox News Digital he sees the outside organization help as just one pillar in an overall winning strategy.

"You’ve got Trump Force 47, they’re going after a specific targeted bloc of voters. You’ve got the Musk PAC, they’re going after a different set. You’ve got county parties and the state party going after a different set of folks. And when you put it all together, I think multiple individuals are going to be contacted by multiple different groups… I think it’s a strength," Hoekstra said.

Republican operatives working in the field echoed Hoekstra’s sentiment, telling Fox News Digital that the party’s operation in the state is better than it's ever been, pointing to Republican efforts to turn out low-propensity voters and the robust base of volunteers behind that effort.

"They can’t see the forest through the trees," one GOP operative, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital of some within the party who have expressed worry about the GOP operation in Michigan.

"Your typical hardline Republican is not seeing these field efforts, they’re not having people go to their door, simply because we are chasing these lower-propensity Republican voters and these swing voters that we can win over," the source added, noting that this effort is similar for down ballot races in the state as well.

Jason Roe, a GOP strategist working with the Barrett campaign, told Fox News Digital that the cooperation between the Trump campaign, down ballot campaigns, RNC and outside organizations has been robust, something that he believes is helping drive results in the state.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

"When you look at the totality of all the organizations, we’ve got a lot more bodies out there working than we have had in a long time," Roe said.

Roe said much of the GOP effort at this point has been "chasing absentee ballots," arguing that doing so has allowed operatives on the ground the ability to target lower-propensity voters to get out and vote for Republican candidates.

"I think there is a more qualitative approach to how campaigns are doing it than in the past, which was more quantitative, when Election Day voting was way more important than absentee voting," he said, adding that in the past "it was about knocking on the most doors, and now it’s very targeted on the most important doors where we can bank votes now."

Another GOP source on the ground in Michigan, speaking to Fox News Digital anonymously, echoed a similar sentiment, noting the cooperation between the Rogers and Trump campaigns.

"The Rogers campaign and Trump campaign have teamed up and are crushing doors, including 40,000 on this past Saturday alone," the source said. "It’s a massive, professional and volunteer effort and I’m not concerned about the ground at all. Democrats? Haven’t really seen them aside from press releases."

Another GOP operative who spoke to Fox News Digital anonymously also touted the way all facets of the Republican effort have worked together, noting that Michigan "is a battleground at all levels."

"It’s a must-win state on the presidential race, has its highly competitive Senate race, and is ground zero for House Republicans to grow their majority in Congress," the operative said. "Republicans up and down the ballot have deployed a very robust grassroots program to get out the vote in all corners of the battleground, and we’re seeing voter enthusiasm like never before."

Added all up, Hoekstra believes Republicans have the ground game in Michigan to win.

"People are all energized, they know what we are fighting for, and what we need to do to win," Hoekstra said. "It is one massive effort, chasing votes."
A former president, a Kennedy, a pop star, and a tech giant have all thrown their names behind a presidential candidate this year — but will it make a difference?

Former President Obama, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Taylor Swift are the only individuals to receive net positive personal ratings among nine figures tested, including the current presidential and vice presidential candidates.

The new Fox News survey finds Obama with the best rating at +10 points net positive (55% favorable vs. 45% unfavorable). Still, that’s nowhere near the +28-point rating he had in May 2020 (63%, 35%) the last time the survey asked.

Kennedy bests Swift with a +7 net positive rating (51% favorable, 44% unfavorable), while she garners a positive rating of +3 (49%, 46%).

Obama has been campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris, while Swift endorsed her in September. Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and endorsed former President Trump.

The other notable endorsement comes from businessman Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump over the summer. Musk’s personal rating is underwater by 4 points (44% favorable, 48% unfavorable).

FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP AHEAD OF HARRIS BY 2 POINTS NATIONALLY

Those who have a favorable view of Obama back Harris by 61 points, while those with a positive view of Swift back her by 49 points.

Voters with a favorable view of Musk back Trump by 67 points, while those who like Kennedy back the former president by 45 points.

The current presidential and vice presidential candidates fare worse than their high-profile endorsers. Harris is underwater by 5 points (47% favorable, 52% unfavorable) while Trump is at negative 4 (48%, 52%). Trump’s rating is an improvement from his -8 rating in September, while Harris’ numbers are worse than her -2 net favorability a month ago.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz each received a negative 3 rating. Vance improved since September (-12), while Walz went from a positive 3 rating to a -3.

The vice presidential candidates squared off in a debate on Oct. 1.

President Biden is at the bottom of the scoreboard with a -22 rating (39% favorable, 61% unfavorable).

At least 7 in 10 Democrats have a favorable view of Obama, Harris, Walz, Biden and Swift, while at least 7 in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Trump, Vance, Musk and Kennedy.

The only individual getting a majority favorable rating among independents is Obama (54% favorable, 44% unfavorable).

At least half of men and women have a favorable view of Obama, but that’s where the similarities between the genders end. At least half of men have positive opinions of Kennedy, Trump and Musk, while for women it’s Swift and Harris.

5 KEY NUMBERS THAT WILL DECIDE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Majorities of Black voters have a favorable opinion of Obama, Harris, Walz and Biden and just over half favor Swift, while just over half of White voters favor Kennedy and Trump.

One more thing…

In August, 7 in 10 voters felt political debate in the U.S. was overheated and dangerous, while a quarter said it was heated but healthy — and that’s exactly where things stand today.

What has changed, however, is who they blame for the state of things. In August, those saying rhetoric was overheated blamed the Republican Party by 16 points (44% GOP, 28% Dem) and that gap has shrunk to just 2 points today (45% GOP vs. 43% Dem).

Key groups across the board are now more likely to point to Democrats, including Democrats themselves. In August, 5% of Democrats blamed their party, while it’s 15% today, a 10-point jump.

Seventy percent of Republicans blame the Democratic Party for overheated and dangerous debate, up from 55 percent in August.

Independents jumped from 14% blaming the Democratic Party in August to 38% now. Still, they continue to blame the Republican Party slightly more at 41%, up from 26% in August.

Conducted Oct. 11-14 under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,110 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (129) and cellphones (719) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (262). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 870 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with results among subgroup is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis and voter file data. Likely voters are based on a probabilistic statistical model that relies on past voting history, interest in the current election, age, education, race, ethnicity, church attendance and marital status.
Representative James Clyburn (D-SC) said Thursday on CNN’s “The Lead” that Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris should hold more town hall meetings to interact with voters.

Host Jake Tapper said, “Do you think that she should be doing more rallies? I covered Obama in 2008, as you might remember, I would often interview you when I was covering that campaign and at this point, she’s doing two rallies today. But generally speaking, comparing her rally schedule in October to his rallies schedule in October 2008 he did more. Now, maybe we’re in a new era, maybe 2024 you don’t need to do that. I don’t know. Certainly Donald Trump is not doing the same number of rallies that he did in 2016. but what do you think if you were telling her i mean, she’s a young vigorous woman. I mean, she has energy. she could be contrasting her youth comparatively. do you think she should be doing more?”

Clyburn said, “Well, I think you know, my theory on that is she should be doing more town hall type meetings interacting with voters. Let the voters ask their questions, respond to the voters. Not have this filtering that takes place between they candidate and the people that often happens when we have these one-on-one interviews like she has been having. I don’t have anything against those so long as they are supplemented. But if she wants to show her best self it is always when she is engaging with the voters and not being filtered about any commentator but one-on-one with the voters. So she really going to do anything more than what she’s doing that’s what I would suggest.”
Vice President Kamala Harris is barnstorming Wisconsin on Thursday with three separate engagements scheduled across the crucial state.

The Democratic nominee for president has events scheduled in Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay throughout the day as she tries to make her pitch to voters just weeks from the election.

She will begin her day in Milwaukee, which is the state's biggest Democratic stronghold. According to the Harris-Walz campaign, the vice president will drop in on a business class at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. She will also speak with students on campus and emphasize her "opportunity economy" plan.

Afterward, Harris will go to La Crosse and hold a rally at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

For her last event of the day in Wisconsin, she will have a rally in Green Bay outside of Lambeau Field.

Harris' campaign emphasized that counties surrounding Green Bay have trended toward Democrats in recent elections, which they attribute to former President Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. For this reason, they believe the area presents a prime opportunity for the candidate.

The campaign noted that Harris' Wisconsin barnstorm comes as they officially knocked on more than 1 million doors in the swing state. Her team said it has over 250 coordinated staff working in more than 50 field offices in 43 counties in Wisconsin, in addition to a team of campus organizers focused on turning out young voters.

Wisconsin has notably flipped in the last two presidential elections and is rated one of several "toss-ups" in Fox News Power Rankings' latest update. Other such states are Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.

Vice President Kamala Harris been dominating Snapchat in the battle for young voters, partly due to the platform’s refusal to reinstate former President Donald Trump’s personal account while simultaneously begging his campaign to advertise on the platform.

The New York Times reports that former President Donald Trump has completely avoided advertising on Snapchat for his 2024 presidential campaign, effectively surrendering the popular social media platform to his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. This decision comes despite Trump’s public emphasis on courting younger voters, particularly young men.

According to Snapchat’s disclosures, the Harris campaign has invested over $5.3 million in ads on the platform, while the Trump campaign has not spent a single dollar. The former president’s absence from Snapchat can be attributed to his ongoing feud with the app’s parent company, Snap, which banned his personal account shortly after the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. Unlike other major tech platforms, Snap has not lifted the ban on Trump’s personal account. The company simultaneously refused to reinstate Trump as it asked his campaign to fork over millions of dollars for advertising.

Snap maintains that while Trump is not allowed to post personally, his campaign is still permitted to purchase political advertisements, which must undergo an internal fact-check process. Despite this, the Trump campaign has refused to spend money on the platform, a stark contrast to his previous campaigns.

Harris has capitalized on this uncontested space, using it to portray herself as a candidate for the future. Her ads feature her campaign theme song, Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” and frame some messages as “back-to-school assignments” to engage college-aged voters.

With the 2024 election looming, both campaigns have ramped up their efforts to reach Gen Z and millennial voters who primarily consume news through social media. Turning out these voters could prove decisive in securing a narrow victory for either candidate.

Digital strategists emphasize the importance of Snapchat as a tool for reaching young Americans interested in politics. The platform boasts over 100 million users in the United States, with roughly 80 percent being 18 or older and eligible to vote. Snapchat also has a higher percentage of users under 30 compared to other major tech apps.

While Snapchat is not the primary battleground for the campaigns’ efforts to win over young voters, with larger investments being made on platforms like Facebook and Google, it remains a significant outlet due to its more personal nature. Users often communicate with friends through the app, making it an ideal space to influence millennial and Gen Z voters.

Vice President Kamala Harris will virtually attend the historic Al Smith dinner on Thursday evening, the Archdiocese of New York confirmed to Fox News Digital.

"VP Harris will appear via a pre-recorded message," the communications director for the Archdiocese of New York, Joseph Zwilling, told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Harris will be the first presidential candidate in 40 years to not physically attend the Catholic charity event – since 1984 when failed presidential Democratic candidate Walter Mondale skipped. Former President Trump will attend and address the sold-out audience during the event Thursday.

Harris' snub of the historic Catholic charity event irked New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan on his podcast this week.

KAMALA HARRIS PLANS TO SKIP HISTORIC AL SMITH DINNER DESPITE LONG-STANDING TRADITION

"This year will be imbalanced because, sadly, Kamala Harris isn't coming," Dolan said on his podcast Wednesday. "It's a shame because the nature of the evening is to bring people together. The nature of the evening is civility, patriotism, humor. It's not a campaign speech. It's not a campaign stop."

He did add during the podcast that Harris was slated to appear via "Zoom."

"She's sending a Zoom," Dolan said during the podcast. Adding: "We have it already… I haven't looked at it. There's an embargo on it."

MORNING GLORY: WHY IS KAMALA HARRIS SKIPPING THE AL SMITH DINNER IN NEW YORK CITY?

The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner was launched in 1946, and has raised millions of dollars for charities supporting women and children, and has since grown to become a political and cultural hallmark of election seasons. The dinner is named after the first Catholic presidential candidate, Al Smith, who served as the 42nd governor of New York and ran for president as a Democrat in 1928.

This year's dinner will be emceed by comedian Jim Gaffigan, who has portrayed Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in sketches on "Saturday Night Live" this fall.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment and confirmation that Harris will virtually attend the event, but did not receive a reply.

The campaign previously told Fox News that the vice president would not physically attend the event, focusing her time on campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin instead.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREVIEWS AL SMITH DINNER REMARKS AMID HARRIS’ ABSENCE: ‘WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED’

"The Vice President is going to be campaigning in a battleground state that day, and the campaign wants to maximize her time in the battlegrounds this close to the election. Her team also told the organizers that she would very much like to attend their event as President. This would make her one of the first sitting Presidents to attend," the campaign said.

Trump attended the dinner in-person in 2016, as did then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and attended 2020's virtual dinner due to the pandemic.

CLINTON AND TRUMP TRADE JABS AT AL SMITH DINNER

"It will be an honor to attend the SOLD OUT 79th ANNUAL AL SMITH DINNER on October 17th in New York. It will be great to see so many wonderful people there, including Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. We know the Spirit of Al Smith, the first Catholic Nominee of a Major Party, and John F. Kennedy, the FIRST Catholic President, will be in the room with us that night," Trump posted on Truth Social last month.

"It was a virtual event in 2020, and I was delighted to speak to our Catholic friends that day and, of course, it was a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL evening in 2016 when we were there in person with Crooked Hillary Clinton. The reviews of my remarks were TREMENDOUS. It’s sad, but not surprising, that Kamala has decided not to attend. I don’t know what she has against our Catholic friends, but it must be a lot, because she certainly hasn’t been very nice to them, in fact, Catholics are literally being persecuted by this Administration. Any Catholic that votes for Comrade Kamala Harris should have their head examined," he added.
Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said he supports kicker Harrison Butker for creating a PAC with a Republican senator to promote Christian values.

"One of the things I talk to the players every year about at training camp is using their platform to make a difference," Hunt said on Wednesday. "We have players on both sides of the political spectrum, both sides of whatever controversial issue you want to bring up. I’m not at all concerned when our players use their platform to make a difference."

Hunt, 59, gave his support to the kicker after months of controversy and backlash against Butker for his conservative beliefs.

Butker announced his UPRIGHT PAC last weekend along with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who earned the kicker's endorsement ahead of the general election against Democrat Lucas Kunce. Butker has also endorsed former President Trump in the upcoming election, citing Trump's pro-life stance.

Prior to that, Butker ignited the controversy over his beliefs when he gave a commencement speech at Benedictine College in May. The speech went viral as Butker suggested the woman graduates should be more excited about getting married and having children than embarking on careers. At the private Catholic liberal arts school in Atchison, Kansas, Butker also suggested that some Catholic leaders were "pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America."

"Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife Isabelle would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother," Butker said at the time.

Shortly after the speech, Butker's jersey sales soared. His jersey was the 11th-most purchased in the NFL from March 1 to May 31, the NFLPA said, indicating many fans of the Chiefs and NFL as a whole were willing to spend money to embrace Butker and his beliefs.

However, Butker's speech also incited fierce and oftentimes emotional backlash from many in the mainstream media. Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins mocked Butker for being a kicker after delivering the remarks, while NBC's "Today" host Hoda Kotb scolded the kicker, telling him "not to speak for women."

The criticisms against Butker were also amplified within the Chiefs' own fan base due to the influx of new fans that began following the team after Travis Kelce started dating Taylor Swift.

Butker was the subject of a social media mockery campaign by Swift fans, who generated a series of memes and vitriolic insults against the kicker and his followers. This campaign was documented in a Kansas City Star story that exposed Swift fans for calling Butker "the smallest man who ever lived," in reference to one of Swift's songs, among other nicknames.

HARRISON BUTKER'S FAITH-DRIVEN COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT BENEDICTINE COLLEGE: READ THE SPEECH HERE

The Chiefs' owner previously credited Swift for bringing an influx of new fans to the team after the 2023 regular season. During a CNBC interview in January, Hunt said the team's following, especially women, grew by "leaps and bounds" amid Swift's relationship with Kelce.

Many of those same fans who Swift brought in share the pop star's political values, which has manifested in aggression toward Butker and other individuals close to the team with conservative values.

Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president on Sept. 10 and has endorsed Democratic candidates dating back to 2018, when she endorsed Democratic candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections in Tennessee.

Those beliefs have not stopped Swift herself from cheering on Butker, as she was seen visibly celebrating his game-winning field goal when the Chiefs.

However, her fans have still gone after the kicker on multiple occasions on social media over the course of the year. Butker is not the only victim of this aggression either.

When quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany Mahomes liked an Instagram post from former President Donald Trump's account on Aug. 13 which laid out the former president's 2024 policy agenda, Swift fans found out quickly. Multiple online Swift fan pages contributed to spreading screenshots of Mahomes' initial like of Trump's policy platform, inciting backlash against Mahomes. Mahomes has had to address this backlash in other social media posts multiple times since then.

Swift's endorsement of Harris prompted a vocal response from former President Trump, who Mahomes has been tied to supporting. Trump posted a message to his Truth Social platform that read "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT" on Sept. 15, and in an interview with "FOX & Friends" on Sept. 11, the former president said he "liked Mahomes much better" than Swift.

Patrick Mahomes even had to answer for these exchanges during a press conference on Sept. 11, when he said he commended his wife's influence but also said he would not endorse a candidate in the upcoming election.

Despite showing recent support for Butker, Hunt may be politically opposed to his kicker, based on his donation history.

The Hunt family has supported a group urging Missouri voters to reject a ballot measure that would overturn a near-total ban on abortion in the state through Unity Hunt, the company that oversees the assets of the Lamar Hunt family. The Chiefs have declined to comment on the $300,000 donation other than confirming to The Kansas City Star that the money was wired by Clark Hunt's half-brother, Lamar Hunt Jr., through his account with Unity Hunt.

Meanwhile, the NFL has distanced itself from Butker's comments altogether, issuing a statement shortly after his initial speech.

"His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger," the statement read.

The Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union (MPFFU) declined to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election.

Matt Sahr, who serves as the President of the MPFFU explained to Politico that the union was “following” the recommendation from the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), which recently declined to endorse Harris in the election.

Sahr told the outlet that while the union had decided to follow the request from the IAFF, the union had advised members that “Harris is the best choice” to support.

“We are following the IAFF recommendation on the presidential election,” Sahr explained. “However, we have made it clear to our members that our executive board believes Harris is the best choice for supporting our labor issues.”

MPFFU’s decision to not endorse a candidate in the election comes after Edward Kelly, who serves as the General President of the IAFF called for “state firefighter unions” to opt out of issuing “presidential endorsements” during a call, several people close to the matter told the outlet:

During an internal virtual call last week, IAFF General President Edward Kellly asked state firefighter unions to not issue any of their own presidential endorsements, according to three people familiar with the call who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter. Kellly said other battleground states rolling out their own endorsements could ultimately hurt Harris, given Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Arizona could all come out against Harris in response.

In the IAFF’s announcement of the non-endorsement, Kelly revealed that “by a margin of 1.2 percent,” the union had decided “to not endorse a candidate.”

“Today, the IAFF Executive Board, by a margin of 1.2 percent, voted to not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election,” Kelly said.

While the MPFFU declined to endorse a candidate in the presidential election, the California Professional Firefighters (CPF) union revealed in a press release on Monday that they were endorsing Harris.

“Kamala Harris has always been a tremendous supporter of California’s firefighters,” CPF President Brian Rice said in a statement. “From her time as a local elected official to a statewide leader as our Attorney General and U.S. Senator to service as our nation’s Vice President, Kamala Harris has lifted up our work and delivered the resources firefighters need to protect California’s people and their property.”

The non-endorsement from the IAFF and the MPFFU comes after the Teamsters Union, decided not to endorse Harris or former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election, though polling found that almost 60 percent of Teamster members support Trump, while 34 percent expressed support for Harris.
It’s election season in America, and that means early voting, absentee ballots, and making sure your voter registration is current.

It’s also a test of how well each state maintains its voter rolls, its election systems, and the ways each state assures its elections are conducted and counted fairly.

A new report from the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) counts at least fifty threats to election integrity. The report, just out this week, categorizes fifty different threats to election integrity according to whether they concern the influence of “dark money,” lawfare operations, voter fraud, or election fraud. ​The report documents examples of each and offers potential solutions.

On the most recent episode of The Drill Down, Peter Schweizer and co-host Eric Eggers tackle the many ways elections can be rigged and, more importantly, how to make sure that it doesn’t happen.

Many states have been conscientious about cleaning their voter rolls — removing deceased voters, voters who have left the state, voters who are not U.S. citizens but who were registered through their driver’s license applications, and so forth.

States such as Michigan, however, have not been so fastidious, as the GAI report and the Drill Down hosts explain. “We always talk about this because this continues to be a problem in [battleground] states that are poised to matter,” says co-host Eric Eggers. “In Michigan, we’re seeing the number of counties with voter registration rates over 100 percent.”

Eggers wrote a book in 2018 called FRAUD that detailed many of the different types of election rigging and fixing that have taken place in U.S. history. That book, however, was published two years before the 2020 COVID pandemic, and rule changes made by some states that were ostensibly to make voting safer during the pandemic had the effect of making election security much harder to ensure.

GAI’s report covers how those rule changes, which many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election.

“We’re now seeing 53 counties in Michigan with more than 100% registration, which obviously means there are some names on there that don’t belong there,” Eggers says. He notes this isn’t always the fault of local or state election officials. Technically, it is the voter’s responsibility to call up their previous state’s registrar and ask to be removed from their voter rolls. “The book I wrote in 2018 came about because of a report [GAI] did that focused on duplication in voter rolls. We found more than two thousand instances of double voting in 2016 in Florida alone.” That report from 2017 is available on GAI’s website here.

GAI’s new report explains how those rule changes, which in many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election. The report divides the risks to our elections into five categories:

“ Dark money” such as “Zuckerbucks” that is used for public election administration.

such as “Zuckerbucks” that is used for public election administration. Lawfare operations that use taxpayer resources to “weaponize the justice system against challengers to incumbents.

that use taxpayer resources to “weaponize the justice system against challengers to incumbents. “ Get Out the Vote” operations that use nonprofit status to target voters from a preferred political party.

by people who double-vote, fraudulently vote someone else’s ballot, or vote without being eligible to vote. Election Fraud that seeks to fix elections by illegal activities that take place during the counting or collection of ballots.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reportedly thinking about waiting until after the November presidential elections to present a post-war Gaza plan, Axios reported Wednesday.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has engulfed the Middle East since last October and shown no signs of stopping, even as the U.S. has tried to intervene and broker a ceasefire. Blinken, who has been heavily involved in ceasefire negotiations, is now reportedly thinking that he will wait until after the November election to propose a plan negotiated jointly by Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to essentially govern Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war is over — but the plan is unpopular even within Blinken’s ranks, officials from the U.S., Israel, UAE and Palestinian Authority told Axios. (RELATED: Israel Reportedly Assures Biden-Harris Admin It Won’t Go After Iranian Oil, Nuclear Sites)

The idea to present the proposal after the November elections came about during a sideline discussion between Blinken and a senior UAE and Israeli diplomat at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in mid-September, officials told Axios. The Emirates had initially created the plan, but the Israelis had issues with the terms and wanted Blinken to help bridge gaps.

Blinken’s tenure has been particularly fraught with problems, including the current Middle East conflict — which now involves several different players — the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and tensions with an increasingly hostile China, which is working through various bad acts to try to undermine the U.S. The Secretary of State recently signaled that he has no interest in staying in his role in a potential Harris administration after Biden leaves the Oval Office in January.

The deal is highly complex. It would see an international force deploy into Gaza to help govern the region and provide law enforcement in the interim, according to Axios. The Emirates could send their own soldiers to help police the enclave.

The deal rests on the Palestinian Authority — which governs over Gaza currently, even though Hamas is the de facto ruler over the region — agreeing to the deal, so long as it takes “meaningful reforms and [is] led by a new prime minister who is empowered and independent,” officials told Axios. It would also have to include a credible vision for a future two-state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

But there are too many disagreements over terms between the Israelis and the UAE over the deal, officials told Axios. The Palestinian authority also seems doubtful about the potential agreement.

“Playing with Gaza governance is too dangerous. Any mistake could kill the Palestinian national project,” a senior Palestinian Authority official told Axios.

There’s another problem; the proposal is a highly contentious issue within the State Department, and some officials don’t appear to agree with Blinken’s way of thinking, officials told Axios. There have been closed-door debates between Blinken and senior State officials over the deal. Some officials believe that Blinken’s adviser on the matter, Jaime Rubin, isn’t competent.

“The White House doesn’t like him and many people in the State Department who deal with this issue don’t take him seriously, but he is a voice on this and he is close to Blinken,” one U.S. official told Axios.

During an interview with the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report” on Wednesday, 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris responded to a question on if she still supports taxpayer dollars paying for gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners or detained migrants by stating that she’ll “follow the law” just as her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump did during her administration to provide such surgeries, when medically needed, to those in the federal prison system and Trump is “trying to create a sense of fear in the voters…on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote.”

Host Bret Baier asked, “So, are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?”

Harris answered, “I will follow the law. And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with, now, it’s a public report, that, under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available to — on a medical necessity basis — to people in the federal prison system. And I think, frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house.”

Baier then said, “The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.”

Harris cut in to say that Trump has to take responsibility for what happened when he was in office.

Baier then said that no surgeries happened during the Trump administration and asked, “So, would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?”

Harris responded, “I will follow the law. Just as I think Donald Trump would say he did.”

She added, “I think it’s — he spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters, because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas — $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote. And, again, his policy was no different.”

The government of Russia confirmed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia is not yet an official member of the anti-American BRICS coalition, claiming that the Middle East will formalize its position one way or the other at this month’s summit.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov issued a statement clarifying that Riyadh does not officially belong to BRICS after another Kremlin official, aide Yuri Ushakov, named Saudi Arabia as a member a week ago, according to Reuters. The Russian government is preparing to host the annual BRICS summit in the city of Kazan beginning on October 22.

BRICS is an economic, security, and diplomatic alliance that initially consisted of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the countries that gave it its name. The BRICS countries voted to expand membership a year ago and extended invites to six nations: Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Argentina, and Ethiopia. Argentina, under the new leadership of anti-communist President Javier Milei, plainly declined the invite, while the others publicly accepted.

Saudi state television announced in January that the country had begun its membership term in BRICS, reports that went widely unquestioned as Saudi Crown Prince made an appearance at an emergency BRICS event in November to condemn Israel’s self-defense response to the atrocities committed by Iran-backed terrorist organization Hamas on October 7 of that year.

By the end of the month, however, its status became murky, as reports surfaced that Riyadh had not finalized the process to join the coalition.

“Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to the invitation to join BRICS. It is still under consideration,” an anonymous Saudi source told Reuters.

South African Ambassador to Russia Mzuvukile Geoff Maqetuka told the Russian news agency Tass in February that Saudi Arabia was “still going through its own processes” and “has not yet endorsed” membership.

Little updates have surfaced in February on whether Saudi Arabia is a formal member of BRICS or not. When Ushakov listed Saudi Arabia among BRICS members while discussing the upcoming summit, few questioned the addition.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, specified that Saudi Arabia’s status remains unclear as of Tuesday.

“The summit will take place now, we will supply additional information on who will represent Saudi Arabia, whether it will be represented at this summit, and we will draw conclusions from this,” Peskov said.

Reuters reported on October 10 that, despite the BRICS summit typically attracting the heads of government of its member countries, Mohammed bin Salman was expected not to attend. That report cited Ushakov, who claimed nine out of ten BRICS countries would send leaders, while Saudi Arabia would send Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.

“Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in January that Riyadh was still considering the invitation to join BRICS,” the outlet added.

BRICS was created to foster an alternative to the Western-led global order and has proposed a variety of policies to undermine the United States specifically, including plans to drop the U.S. dollar as its international trade currency and a united front in defying Western-led human rights sanctions. Saudi Arabia, as a longtime close ally of America’s is an unlikely candidate for BRICS membership, particularly given the full member status of its top geopolitical rival, Iran.

The Saudi government began to drift away from American influence, however, under the ongoing presidency of Joe Biden. Biden antagonized Riyadh as a presidential candidate, promising to turn the country into a “pariah” over the gruesome killing of Islamist writer Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi embassy. After taking over the White House, Biden rapidly moved to take international measures that challenged Saudi Arabia’s national security interests, including delisting the Yemeni Houthis, an Iran-backed terrorist organization that had repeatedly bombed Saudi Arabia, as a foreign terrorist organization. Biden also froze sales of American offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia as he expanded financial opportunities for the Houthis through the delisting.

Three years later, the Houthis are an existential threat to global shipping as they have launched a campaign attacking commercial ships in and around the Red Sea, seemingly at random. Biden claimed in January that his decision to delist the Houthis was “irrelevant” to their growth as a terrorist entity.

The Saudi government, meanwhile, moved out of America’s sphere of influence, reconciling with Iran through a deal brokered in Beijing in March 2023, leading to the invites to both to join BRICS. Biden attempted to reconstruct the broken relationship in a visit to Saudi Arabia in 2022 now colloquially described as the “fist bump summit,” but the summit went poorly, with no concrete deliverables brought home. Shortly after the summit, anonymous reports surfaced that Mohammed bin Salman was openly mocking Biden’s “mental acuity” with his staffers.

Given reports of personal animosity before the crown prince and Biden, and Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential campaign, some observers have suggested that the Saudi government is waiting to see the results of the American election before deciding on its BRICS membership. It will likely have to make a definitive move in favor or against membership in the near future, however, as a growing list of countries are actively campaigning to join the anti-Western alliance. Rogue states such as Venezuela and Cuba have openly expressed interest in BRICS. Turkey, a NATO country, has also said it is seeking to join BRICS and is expected to have some level of representation at the upcoming summit.

Four years ago this week, the corporate press helped airlift Joe Biden to the White House by blacking out coverage of his international pay-for-play scandal, after the New York Post discovered evidence of the scandal on an abandoned Biden laptop. The press reaction ranged from refusing entirely to cover the story because it was a “waste of time” to only covering it insofar as outlets could cast doubt on its legitimacy. After the election, polling would show that 1 in 6 Biden voters would have changed their vote had they known about some of the stories suppressed by the media, including the Hunter Biden laptop story.

It was the most infamous, though not the only, instance of journalists interfering to swing the 2020 election for the Democrats by stifling inconvenient reporting and propagating nonsense about Donald Trump, Biden’s Republican opponent. (Biden got a very minor taste of the media’s wrath this summer, when the powers that be decided he was no longer an expedient means to Democrat victory, and he didn’t last a month.)

The Biden laptop story blackout followed four entire years in which the media, in tandem with the Clinton campaign and the intelligence apparatus, spread lies about Trump based on the Russia collusion hoax and every other dubiously-sourced rumor they could find.

The good news is, after seeing how cravenly the corporate press carried water for the Clinton campaign’s false narrative about Trump and Russia, America is recognizing and dismissing media hoaxes more quickly these days. And as the life cycle of each media lie shrinks, the dishonesty — dare I say, disinformation? — has been attempted even more rapidly and more desperately.

Just last week, CBS News used deceptive video splicing to replace one of Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ answers on “60 Minutes” with one that sounded less awful. A preview clip of the interview showed Harris responding to a question with nonsensical babble, but when the full interview aired, that answer was nowhere to be seen, having been replaced by a completely different response. The original answer was also missing from the transcript released by the network, and CBS continues to refuse to release an undoctored transcript.

The most outrageous election interference from the press this cycle might be the pile-up on Trump by ABC News “moderators” when Trump met Harris for a singular presidential debate in September. They lobbed “fact checks” at Trump left and right while refusing to question Harris’ many falsehoods. Throughout the debate, the format resembled ABC’s David Muir and Linsey Davis asking Trump to explain how he could possibly be so horrible and then giving Harris a chance to opine on whether she thought Trump was horrible and why.

The moderators weren’t much better when vice presidential candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Walz met for their own debate, with CBS News promising not to “fact check” the candidates before breaking that promise to challenge — incorrectly — one of Vance’s responses.

Harris’ campaign itself — at least the “brat,” “joyful” version of it that we’re supposed to believe — is itself a media creation. Only 87 days ago, Kamala Harris was not the Democrat nominee but only one of the least popular vice presidents in American history. Before she was magically shuttled into place as the presidential nominee, Harris was the subject of headlines like “Exasperation and dysfunction: Inside Kamala Harris’ frustrating start as vice president” and “How Joe Biden should solve the Kamala Harris Conundrum” from the corporate press. It was so bad that Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren were leaving open the question of whether Biden should switch out his unpopular VP in 2024 (New York Magazine answered that question in the affirmative). The New York Times called her Democrats’ “unspoken” “electoral challenge.”

That all changed on July 21. As soon as Harris became the only option to face Trump, newsrooms fell into line and began pumping out a gushy narrative about “The Reintroduction of Kamala Harris” to convince voters “How Kamala Harris Can Win and Make History.” Journalists said they were “coconut-pilled.” It was obvious to everyone why the change really happened.

Before that, of course, the entire media establishment had hung its tattered reputation on the brazenly disqualifying lie that Joe Biden’s brain was still in office. (That narrative was discarded, like Old Joe, as soon as it was no longer politically expedient.) If Biden was still the nominee, they’d still be spreading it.

Weeks before that, when Donald Trump nearly had his head exploded on live TV — in an attempt incubated by years of “assassination prep” by the media — headline writers first downplayed the shooting as an “incident” involving “popping noises.” Then, talking heads victim-blamed him for getting himself shot. News photographers started complaining that the iconic image of Trump fist-pumping with the American flag behind him moments after he was shot was too flattering. When another assassination attempt happened two months later, it was rushed out of the news as quickly as possible.

When Harris’ role as the “border czar” of an administration that roughly doubled the number of illegal aliens in the country became a political liability, the media all just agreed to pretend she had never been in charge of the border, actually. Axios even “corrected” its own previous reporting to sell the lie.

The media regularly attempt to convince voters that Trump plans to imprison his political opponents while also treating the multi-pronged attempt by the Biden-Harris Justice Department and its allies to throw Trump in prison.

They make up stupid lies too, and sometimes the dumber the lie, the more aggressive the news cycle. When Trump said the auto industry would face a “bloodbath” of economic repercussions if he lost the election, newsrooms covered the remark as if Trump had threatened to personally kill and maim his political opponents in an election night massacre.

When the Trump campaign drew attention to concerns expressed by residents of a small Ohio town that Haitian migrants dumped there by the Biden-Harris administration’s border disaster were terrorizing residents, overwhelming schools, causing deadly car accidents, and gruesomely capturing and eating small animals, the media pretended Trump was just a crazy old man ranting about cat and dog kebabs.

Meanwhile, regime media make excuses for Harris hiding from questions about her policies — and get rewarded with assured softball interview slots in return. They’re setting new records for shamelessness in the election interference department, and they’ve still got three weeks to go.

Note: This is a satirical piece.

In the upcoming presidential election, the Democrats and the media (I know, I am being redundant here), want us to focus on the messenger, not the message. The philosophies and policies of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris could not be more starkly different.

Trump is running on policies; Harris is running on hating Trump.

Republican voters are educated by life, not by leftist-dominated institutions. They use common sense, not force-fed dogma. Trump supporters like Elon Musk create value, and don’t only consume it.

We are two different sets of voters. Dems are takers; Republicans are makers. Our vision for the country is different. Republicans want there to be a helping hand, not a government-dependent lifestyle. We prefer a safety net to a safety hammock.

Kamala is desperate now. She has a new attack line against Trump: She just passed her physical and now wants to see the results of his. During her exam her doctor told her to stop drinking wine. When she asked why, the doctor said, “So I can finish your exam.”

Kamala asking to see Trump’s physical exam results made the news. It has gotten to where if no one gets a shot at assassinating Trump, it’s a slow news day. And an unvetted, CIA-linked Afghan, fresh to our county, allegedly got caught buying weapons for an alleged Election Day terrorist attack. He was not radicalized by Islamic terrorists here, but rather by months of campaign commercials.

Voters can see where the medical-industrial complex, led by Democrats, has been so wrong over time. Co-opted by the left, they told us four years ago we would be fired, couldn’t travel or serve in the military if we didn’t get vaccinated. Yet they let in countless illegal migrants through a porous border and didn’t require them to get vaccinated until 2022.

Even Joe Biden, who was vaccinated several times, got Covid right before he was stabbed in the back by his own party. He probably didn’t want to run anyway, with Covid taking away his sense of smell. He could not sniff children anymore, so the thrill was gone.

It is fascinating to see how quickly the Democrat machine turned on Biden. They are trying to push Kamala Harris across the finish line before anyone figures out that she is an empty pantsuit. They put Kamala on the cover of Vogue, then they put Joe on the cover of Morgue.

Because of Kamala’s policies, the economy is not good for most Americans. 1,200 Walgreens are closing. The ten stores in Chicago say they are going to move to a safer location: Gaza.

Kamala lied about Joe Biden’s wellness, her record and her background. We know she didn’t work at McDonald’s because Mayor McCheese was never forced to resign over a sex scandal.

I am at a loss to know how Democrats think she has the moral high ground in this race or is, inexplicably, the self-anointed “agent of change.”

Hurting for the self-respecting man vote, Kamala hired goof ball Tim Walz as her running mate. Pretending to be manly, he first changed a clean air filter in a truck. That failed. Monday the Dems dressed him up like Elmer Fudd and sent him hunting. He could not work his shotgun. It felt like Michael Dukakis riding that tank.

During this staged “hunt,” Walz boasted of the support of Dick Cheney and Taylor Swift. Perfect. I would rather be shot in the face than be forced to listen to a Taylor Swift song.

To be fair, it is good that I do not have to hunt for my own food. I have no idea where the natural habitat of pizza is.

Republicans love the Fourth of July and other all-American traditions. Kamala bad-mouthed Christopher Columbus and called Columbus Day “Indigenous People’s Day.” You know, for all those native Americans who had it great until unchecked immigration changed their way of life.

It turns out that Columbus was Jewish. So there you have it: Make it another Jewish holiday. Problem solved.

An example of how Republicans differ from Democrats: If the Dems lose the election, what will they do? Kamala is a lifelong politician; thus, she has no marketable business skills. Trump can go back into his businesses, or even into entertainment. I’m guessing entertainment, because he recently got a headshot.

I just have to say it. You already know it. You feel it. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell.

In the nearly three months since the Democrat Party elite pushed President Joe Biden off the reelection train and his dim-witted vice president took his place, Harris and her No. 2 have brought us a nonstop buffet of weird and creepy campaign moments. As have their leftist political allies and their corporate media PR agents.

From Harris’ bizarre and cringy fake accents to the ticket’s bouts of explosive verbal diarrhea that not even “60 Minutes” can fix, the gruesome twosome are a political train wreck — and a campaign manager’s nightmare.

Let Them Smoke Weed

Harris, who has seen support among black male voters sink so badly that former President Barack Obama has gone on a “Shame on ‘the Brothers’” tour, recently rolled out a pandering “Opportunity Agenda” for black men. Interestingly, the proposal includes legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and “ensuring Black entrepreneurs have access to the growing cannabis industry,” USA Today reports.

My how things have seemingly changed. As former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has pointed out, Harris has bragged about her tough-on-crime stance against weed possession.

“She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” Gabbard, who, like Harris, ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Democrat Party presidential nomination, said during a debate. She was referencing an interview Harris gave to “The Breakfast Club” in which cackling Kamala laughed about smoking pot in college.

While the accomplice media is fond of rewriting the political history of Kamala Harris, left-wing Rolling Stone hammered the candidate on her ganja prosecutions in a 2019 piece.

The far-left vice president’s positions, of course, have been “evolving” — at least since late July when she quickly attempted to burn her leftist record and put on a moderate mask. (See the Border Czar’s latest comments on illegal immigration, fracking in Pennsylvania, and a host of her other rapidly evolving positions.)

Harris and Walz are facing a trust gap with men in general, despite Tampon Tim’s efforts to win them over as a “regular guy” who can’t seem to load a shotgun during a pheasant hunt. Maybe that has something to do with their trans agenda, and we’re not talking Trans Ams.

“A lot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than dudes who just want to be dudes. And no hunting, cosplay, or cringy videos [are] going to change that. The bed is made,” conservative pundit Scott Jennings said this week on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

He’s not wrong.

NEW: CNN panel gasps as Scott Jennings roasts Tim Walz’s “hunting cosplay,” says Democrats care more about “dudes who wanna become women than dudes who just wanna be men.”



They gasp because it’s true.

That’s Really Weird

Ultimately, Harris and her running mate are really running on two things: 1) Donald Trump bad. 2) Abortions good. Anyone who has even passingly followed politics knows the many ways the Biden-Harris administration has attempted to “save democracy” by crushing it — from weaponizing the Department of Justice against political enemies to silencing the speech of regime critics.

The abortion rally cry is central to their ridiculous claim to be the defenders and protectors of women, particularly childless cat ladies who really should smile more. The narrative is a bit of a stretch in the wake of revelations that Harris’ husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, has been accused of “forcefully” slapping his then-girlfriend and of being a world-class misogynist when he worked for a high-powered Los Angeles law firm. Emhoff did not deny the allegations during a recent interview with MSNBC’s resident toenail fungus, Joe Scarborough.

Of course, Second Gentleman Doug is no gentleman. In August he publicly acknowledged a Daily Mail report that he cheated on his first wife and knocked up the nanny. A “close friend” of the nanny told the publication that she “did not keep” the baby.

With less than three weeks before the election, the flailing Harris-Walz campaign and its media allies are trying to make Trump’s cholesterol some kind of October surprise. That should play well with the 100 million-plus Americans with high cholesterol. While Trump denies he’s part of the pack, he’s more likely to pick up sympathy votes from the pizza- and cheese-curd-loving voters who are members of the high-cholesterol club.

What’s really preposterous about the talking point is the fact that Harris, fellow Democrats, and corporate media for years tried to hide the current commander-in-chief’s alarming cognitive deficiencies that for so long appeared in plain sight. Not until Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June did the Democrat Party machine acknowledge it had a political problem and hastily replace the demented president with his idiot, do-nothing vice president on the campaign trail.

It’s all crazy. Or as Tampon Tim might say, creepy and weird as hell.

The Biden-Harris administration has become synonymous with an economy in tatters. Americans are struggling with rising prices, stagnant wages, and increased obstacles to starting a business, buying a home or retiring. According to the Gallup Economic Confidence Index, Americans’ outlook on the economy from 2021 to 2024 has been negative.

Contrast this with the economic prosperity seen under the Trump administration. America enjoyed energy abundance, skyrocketing wages, a record number of startups and incredible stock market averages. A large part of this success can be credited to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a tax cut for families and small businesses that fueled one of the strongest economies in decades.

But now, many provisions of the legislation are set to expire next year. Congress must act to extend the tax cuts and reverse the Biden-Harris administration’s economic stagnation. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: Kamala Harris Wants America To Have The World’s Highest Death Tax)

Trump’s tax cuts made an immediate, positive impact on the lives of average Americans — benefiting millions, especially families with children and small business owners. The legislation cut 80% of Americans’ individual income tax rates and nearly doubled the standard deduction, allowing more families to keep what they earn. As the real median household income increased by $5,000 and real wages rose by 4.9%, a majority of Americans found themselves with more take-home income to budget for necessities.

Provisions like capital expensing and income-tax cuts sparked growth-oriented investments for small businesses. When I served as head of the Small Business Administration, I traveled to all 50 states and heard repeatedly from business owners who put their tax savings right back into growing their businesses.

Family-run businesses from North Carolina to Pennsylvania cited the Trump tax cuts as the reason they could afford employee bonuses or new equipment. Recently, 500 Chambers of Commerce called for the tax cuts to be extended.

Naysayers have tried to claim that the tax cuts only benefited the top 1%, but this is demonstrably false. The Tax Foundation notes that in the first year after the passage of the TCJA, the top 1% of taxpayers’ share of taxes did not decrease but rather rose 1.6 percentage points to 40.1%. The latest analysis (tax year 2020) shows it is now even higher, up to 42.3%.

The richest paid more taxes under TCJA, which is not what the radical Left wants you to hear.

When President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 and 1986 tax reforms lightened the income and corporate tax burden on wage earners and job creators, the economy took off. Average Americans saw inflation fall from 13.5% to 4.1%, unemployment fall from 7.6% to 5.5% and the prime interest rate fall by 10.5 percentage points — a historic recovery during the eight years of his presidency.

Like Reaganomics, President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts operated on a simple economic principle: When Main Street businesses are taxed less, they can reinvest that money into their workforce by offering higher wages, better benefits, and more job opportunities. When average American workers benefit from lower taxes and higher take-home pay, families can afford more spending and sustain long-term financial planning. This is the virtuous cycle that both Reaganomics and the Trump tax cuts created — and that the Biden-Harris administration has stifled through inflationary, job-killing policies.

The Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut just before a national election is a worrying bellwether for the Biden-Harris economy’s precipitous decline. With no clear plan for replacing the expiring tax cuts, struggling American families could ultimately face thousands more dollars in income tax liability.

Small business owners, meanwhile, may have to choose between downsizing and closing up shop under a double-digit tax hike.

Congress has a duty to not only extend the tax cuts before they expire but also to build on them by undoing some of the Biden-Harris administration’s ideologically-motivated corporate tax credits, as House Speaker Mike Johnson recently recommended at an America First Policy Institute event. The bottom line is that Bidenomics has failed.

Vice President Kamala Harris has tried to repackage it as “opportunity economics,” but it is the same disastrous policy.

Over the last eight years, Americans who have enjoyed a simplified tax filing and more dollars in their paychecks must now wait and hope these benefits are not taken away in 2025. The evidence could not be clearer: The 2017 tax cuts empowered both small businesses and working families by unburdening them from excessive taxation and giving them the resources to build a strong economy.

Keeping them in place and building on their success will be a lifeline for the vast majority of Americans.

Sparks flew during a CNN segment Tuesday night after 1776 Project PAC founder Ryan Girdusky said the “Ferguson effect” and less police presence in communities leads to spikes in violent crime.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson coined the term “Ferguson effect” in 2014 following the fatal police-involved shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which hypothesizes that a decrease in police activity leads to a surge in violent crime. Girdusky argued that the “Ferguson effect” and the death of George Floyd led to a surge in black male deaths in response to CNN’s Abby Phillips’ criticism of former President Donald Trump calling on the involvement of the military to suppress the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots in the summer of 2020.

“There are the post-George Floyd riots [that] resulted in 15,000 black male deaths in this country,” Girdusky said.

“How?” CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers asked.

Girdusky said there was less police presence at the time of the 2020 riots because officers feared for their jobs at the time, leading to a surge in violent crime.

“The surge of violent crime, it was like Ferguson effect, the Ferguson effect and the Floyd effect … Because what happens is after the Ferguson riot and after the Floyd riot, policemen in fear of their jobs many times and political coverage, pull back from their jobs resulting in crime size,” Girdusky said.

“Ryan, hold on, hold on. Ryan, we got to stop you there because you’re literally making a connection out of your own conjecture,” Phillips said. “You can not just do that.”

CNN published a piece in October 2015 titled, “FBI chief tries to deal with the ‘Ferguson effect,’ which details former FBI director James Comey linking a rise in violent crime to a decrease in police activity.

WATCH:

After Phillips quieted the panel down, Sellers said a surge in riots and violent crimes cannot be blamed on the deaths of black men. (RELATED: Sparks Fly As CNN Panel Debates Kamala Harris’ Lack Of Media Appearances)

“That literally, and my point to you is, that makes no sense,” Sellers said. “And I would argue to you that I’m not coming from a perspective where I want fewer police. I want police actually to be paid more, I just want better police, more qualified police, I want there to be a database where police, if they commit bad acts, they can’t just go from one department to the next. That’s criminal justice reform.”

Phillips then pointed out that Trump was president during Floyd’s death and the BLM riots, leading Girdusky to say that the president does not control local police departments.

“You’re trying to blame crime on Joe Biden, but you’re saying that people who died when Donald Trump was president, that’s not his fault?” Phillips asked. “I don’t agree with either, [with] blame being assigned to either president. I think presidents don’t have a magic wand and they don’t control crime from the White House. But if you’re gonna say that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are responsible for a rise in crime.”

“I didn’t blame Joe Biden,” Girdusky said.

If anyone who I was on the panel with wants to know about the Ferguson or Floyd Effect… here’s where CNN covered it.https://t.co/80ZuBpg8iO — Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) October 16, 2024

Crime became a major political issue in the aftermath of the BLM riots and leading into the 2024 election.

Vice President Kamala Harris supported the defund the police movement that sprung from the BLM riots right before becoming then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate. She also supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund in a May 2020 blog post urging for the bailing of rioters.

After she joined the 2020 presidential ticket, Harris’ then-press secretary Sabrina Singh said Harris did not support defunding police.

“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,” former Harris press secretary Sabrina Singh said in October 2020, according to CNN. “Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.”

Democrat-friendly lawyer licensing boards are targeting two Republican attorneys general in an election year under the pretext of “grievances” filed by political opponents. The years-long government litigation against Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has racked up six-figure legal bills for taxpayers while punishing these elected officials for public speech on behalf of their voters’ priorities.

“Every minute I’m spending defending the AG from this is one minute I’m not spending suing the Biden administration or defending laws passed by the legislature,” Christian Corrigan, one of Knudsen’s lawyers as Montana’s solicitor general, told The Federalist. “This is starting with conservative AGs, but it’s not going to stop there.”

These two proceedings are among the most lengthy in a massive lawfare campaign to deprive right-leaning Americans of competent legal defense, bankrupt them with legal liabilities, and sandbag effective officials, many of which are lawyers. In another prolonged case, a faction of Texas Republicans attempted to defenestrate Attorney General Ken Paxton for fighting Big Tech and Big Pharma.

Republican attorneys general have been at the forefront of checking the Harris-Biden administration’s power abuses that include forcing girls and boys to shower together, seizing private property via environmental policies, pushing dangerous sex treatments on children, and banning Trump from speaking about the lawfare against him.

Knudsen and Rokita are up for re-election this year, and voting has already started in their states. The grievances that target their speech have boosted their political opponents, enabling a constant barrage of attacks and media coverage throughout an election year. In an attorney general debate that aired Sunday, moderator Dan Spehler noted Indiana’s Supreme Court could strip Rokita’s law license, denying voters their choice of attorney general.

Speech Complaints from Politically Invested Insiders

The Indiana Supreme Court’s disciplinary commission is investigating complaints against Rokita by Paula Cardoza-Jones and William Groth. Cardoza-Jones is a recently departed staff attorney for the commission investigating Rokita. She also filed complaints against three lawyers representing Rokita that are now dismissed. Groth is a longtime lawyer for labor unions and pro-abortion interests including the state Democratic Party who has opposed Rokita in court on numerous cases, including cases before the Supreme Court now investigating Groth’s grievance against Rokita.

While ethics complaints are supposed to remain confidential during the investigation to protect lawyers’ reputations from weaponized accusations, details about these have saturated state media since even before they were filed. Rokita lawyer Jim Ammeen said in an interview that reporters have several times asked for comment about new grievance developments before Rokita or his staff were aware of them.

Groth and Cardoza-Jones’ complaints both aim to punish Rokita for publicly defending robust pro-life policies. Groth accuses Rokita of malfeasance for issuing a legal opinion contending the state should continue releasing records that allow pro-lifers to ensure abortionists follow reporting laws. Groth also claimed that noticing his long career of advocating for far-left policies “could also be seen by a reasonable observer to be an attempt to intimidate myself and other critics of the attorney general.”

In a complaint she publicly outlined, Cardoza-Jones accuses Rokita of not expressing enough remorse over a plea deal he signed to quickly resolve an earlier grievance. That grievance targeted Rokita for accurately describing an abortionist who committed an abortion on a ten-year-old as “an abortion activist with a history of failing to report.”

Three attorneys experienced in Indiana’s grievance process told The Federalist that in the last two years the discipline commission has significantly increased the taxpayer resources it expends on investigating before filing charges. Investigations can include depositions and sifting through the work and personal emails and phones of the attorney and his or her staff. Such fishing expeditions can cost targeted attorneys tens of thousands of dollars even if the complaint is dismissed, and for an AG could allow proxies for campaign opponents to dig up and release to the media selectively quoted information entirely unrelated to the complaint that opened the door to the investigation.

Politically motivated legal ethics complaints are increasing, driven by Democrat organizations urging them as a form of political warfare. Even if the charges don’t stick, the process inflicts its own punishment.

Knudsen is being prosecuted for defending Montana’s legislature in court over a 2021 law, known as SB140, that gives the governor the ability to fill court vacancies without pre-selection of judges by an unelected commission. Montana’s left-leaning judiciary objected to more involvement from the first fully Republican government in 16 years, and the resulting constitutional crisis consumed state politics and courtrooms.

Emails the legislature subpoenaed showed Montana Supreme Court justices, judges, and judicial staff organizing against SB140. Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike McGrath previously ran for state attorney general as a Democrat.

In 2021, California-residing attorney Clara Roberts filed a grievance against Knudsen for defending SB140. Defending state laws is a core duty of an attorney general. State records say Roberts has donated to Montana Democrats 13 times since 2000. The grievance has been expanded to 127 subcounts, which Knudsen’s legal team says is the highest in Montana history by a factor of at least eight.

The first special counsel in Knudsen’s case — a longtime Democrat donor appointed because the discipline commission’s top lawyer also previously ran for attorney general as a Democrat — recommended dismissing it. When the commission asked him to investigate further, he resigned.

Then the commission appointed a second special counsel, Tim Strauch, “a longtime Democrat donor and activist [who] is an active supporter of the Montana Supreme Court; he has contributed to 5 current members of the Court,” notes Montana Republican Chairman Don Kaltschmidt. “Strauch has made 27 contributions totaling over $5,500 to Democrat and liberal judicial candidates.”

Patricia Klanke represented a Supreme Court justice in SB140 litigation against Knudsen. The job of another panel member, Lois Menzies, was eliminated by SB140. Until one week ago, both sat on the panel threatening Knudsen’s license for now approximately three years.

Typically, punished ethics violations consist not of political speech by elected officials, but of obvious crimes and ethical breaches, such as in the recent case of an Indiana judge barred from the bench for 45 days for obtaining the assets of a deceased client. Knudsen’s defense argues that the Supreme Court threatening the license of an attorney general for doing his job unconstitutionally violates the separation of powers.

“While Attorney General Knudsen is subject to the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct as a member of the bar, the Montana Constitution creates a degree of constitutional independence for the Attorney General in discharging his official duties of that office,” a July court filing on behalf of Knudsen argues. “That need for that independence is sharpened when he represents the Legislature, another co-equal branch of government … Therefore, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel’s Complaint against the Attorney General for discharging his official duties violates the separation of powers enshrined in the Montana Constitution.”

Unelected Commissions Full of Democrats and Anti-Trump Republicans

The Supreme Courts of Indiana and Montana control state lawyer licensing and discipline through unelected commissions stacked with Democrat supporters and Never Trump Republicans. The AGs are also being prosecuted by the same entity that adjudicates the complaints against them and before which they regularly appear to defend state laws.

After The Federalist reported in February that every member of Indiana’s Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission with publicly available records had donated to Democrats, the commission’s membership has changed. In June, a prominent Democrat prosecutor who publicly supports Rokita’s opponent, Destiny Wells, left the commission’s chairmanship.

Newly elevated commission chairman Peter Rusthoven is a former Ronald Reagan speechwriter and Never Trumper who financially supported Joe Biden and Liz Cheney and endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024. In Politico in February, Rusthoven endorsed removing Trump from the ballot, a legal effort a unanimous Supreme Court voted against in March. Trump endorsed Rokita in June.

Rusthoven told an Indianapolis TV program he supports Harris over Trump due to “character, integrity, trustworthiness.” Harris, a serial liar and advocate of child sex mutilation and virtually unrestricted abortion, publicly admitted she advanced her career via sex with a corrupt politician. She later married a man who admits he left his first wife after impregnating their nanny and doesn’t deny allegations he slapped an ex-girlfriend.

New commission member David Roellgen has been a consistent Republican supporter, according to OpenSecrets.org, but he also donated to the campaign of Democrat former governor and U.S. Sen. Evan Bayh. New member Holly Wojcik donated $10 in 2018 to Florida Republican Ron DeSantis and $50 in 2004 to a Michigan Republican candidate. She also has a lengthy history of 76 donations to Indiana’s trial lawyers PAC.

Trial lawyer lobbies are a well-known major backer of the Democrat Party. They and extreme-left bar associations typically control state and federal judiciaries, and are a key lever shifting the U.S. legal system against the Constitution even in red states.

The Indiana Law PAC is a longtime supporter of state Democrats, including contributions this election cycle to Democrat state Senate Minority Leader Greg Taylor, Democrat state Sen. David Vinzant, Democrat state Sen. David Niezgodski, Democrat state House Whip Justin Moed, and Assistant Democrat House Floor Leader Earl Harris. In red Indiana, the PAC also contributes to Republicans, especially those known for opposing their voters’ priorities.

Disciplinary Commission member Daniel Vinovich also contributed to the PAC, according to state campaign finance records.

This means the majority of Indiana’s commission still has donated to Democrats, even though two of the nine commission members’ political affiliations are not discernable through campaign donations.

While Indiana’s AG targeting involves a Republican Party power struggle between big business interests and its base, Montana’s AG targeting is a more direct case of blue on red. Members of Montana’s Commission on Practice, state GOP Chairman Kaltschmidt says, “have made over 200 political contributions to Democrat and liberal judicial candidates totaling more than $50,000.”

A public hearing over the matter was held last week, with a decision expected this week. The five members not recused for conflicts of interest by the latest hearing on Knudsen’s grievance Oct. 9 were Mike Lamb, Carey Matovich, Troy McGee, Elinor Nault, and Randy Ogle.

Commission chairman Mick Taleff has made 24 donations to Democrats over the years, according to state databases. That includes contributions totaling $250 to Knudsen’s 2024 Democrat opponent, Ben Alke, and to two Montana Supreme Court justices: Beth Baker and Dirk Sandefur. Democrat former governor and former state attorney general Steve Bullock has commissioned Taleff to defend Democrat officials.

Commission member Brad Belke donated $85 to Republican gubernatorial candidate Judy Martz in 2000, and since then has donated small amounts to judges and a Democrat House candidate, according to state records. Commission member Jason Holden’s campaign contributions are all to Democrats or technically nonpartisan races. He donated to Democrat candidates for attorney general and state Supreme Court clerk, and every sitting Montana Supreme Court justice except Beth Baker, say state records.

Board members Cal Mendenhall, Patricia Klanke, Rich Ochsner, and Sheryl Wambsgans have donated only to technically nonpartisan races, state records say. Board member Kelly Gallinger’s donations include a total of $720 to 2020 Democrat attorney general candidate Kimberly Dudik. Of her 34 campaign donations in state records, all went to Democrats or nonpartisan races except for one Republican. She also contributed to the campaigns of state Supreme Court justices Rice, Baker, and McKinnon.

Ogle has donated to Republican, Democrat, and nonpartisan campaigns, according to state records, including $250 to Democrat former Gov. Steve Bullock’s campaign for attorney general in 2008. McGee has also donated to Republican, Democrat, and nonpartisan campaigns, including a total of $325 to Democrat attorney general candidate Pam Bucy in 2012 and a total of $350 to McGrath’s Democrat campaign for attorney general and successful bid for the state Supreme Court.

Matovich has also donated to Republican, technically nonpartisan, and Democrat races, including to five sitting Supreme Court justices, former Democrat attorney general candidate Bucy, and Democrat Supreme Court clerks. All this means that even with the recusals, a majority of the board threatening Knudsen’s law license are Democrat campaign donors.

Judges Overseeing This Circus on the Ballot

Indiana Chief Justice Loretta Rush and Justice Christopher Goff dissented from Rokita’s first discipline agreement because they wanted to punish him more harshly for his truthful speech explaining his use of his office to constituents. Groth, the union lawyer who filed a grievance against Rokita, publicly praised Rush and Goff for siding against the Supreme Court’s more-conservative majority on several cases and advocated against revealing judges’ political affiliations to voters, a policy that helps judiciaries hew closer to the Constitution in red states.

Rush, Goff, and Justice Derek Molter are on Indiana ballots this year. Voting against retaining them would allow the next governor to appoint their replacements. If polls indicate the outcome, that governor will be Republican Mike Braun.

Rush was appointed by Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, an economic conservative who proposed a “truce” on culture war issues, including abortion. Goff and Molter were appointed by Gov. Eric Holcomb, Daniels’ hand-picked successor, who celebrated importing Afghans who did tens of millions of dollars in damage to an Indiana National Guard barracks. One week ago, the U.S. Justice Department announced one of this cohort of “vetted” refugees planned an election-day terror attack.

Holcomb also spoke at the World Economic Forum and attempted to ban Christians from taking communion during Covid while keeping liquor stores open. He didn’t attend this year’s state Republican convention after he was booed there in 2022.
Top Senate Democrats on Tuesday reiterated their calls for the Biden-Harris administration to give protected status to Lebanese nationals as fighting between Israel and Hamas intensifies.

Several Democratic committee chairmen co-signed a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to greenlight Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and move forward with Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) for Lebanese nationals currently living in the United States. Their call follows previous demands by congressional Democrats to allow thousands of Palestinian refugees into the country and national security concerns about immigration from the region.

“On June 5, 2024, we sent the attached letter requesting your administration designate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Lebanon in response to the regional conflict-driven crisis and growing domestic food insecurity, economic collapse, and a stalled Presidential selection process,” the letter began. “In the months since our request, the armed conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has only intensified, claiming the lives of civilians, and worsening the already dire humanitarian emergency.”

“Given these worsening country conditions and the potential for continued crisis, we respectfully reiterate our request for your administration to designate TPS for Lebanon to protect Lebanese nationals currently in the United States,” the letter continued. “We also urge you to swiftly issue the DHS implementation guidance for DED and advance the DED authorization date, to protect Lebanese nationals that recently arrived to the United States.”

The letter was co-signed by Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Homeland Security Committee and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee.

Israel and Hamas have been at war since the Oct. 7 massacre last year. Fighting in the region has intensified as the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has ratcheted up attacks against Israel, prompting Israeli forces to embark on a ground operation in the country to beat back the terrorist group.

TPS may be designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to a foreign country that is experiencing conflict or any type of humanitarian disaster, preventing their citizens in the U.S. from returning home safely, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There are currently 16 countries with unexpired TPS, resulting in roughly 860,000 non-citizens with TPS currently living in the U.S., according to the American Immigration Council.

However, TPS has long been criticized for being temporary-in-name only, with numerous countries having their TPS designation extended again and again throughout the years.

A group of 69 House and Senate Democrats in June had called on Biden and the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to consider opening pathways for Gaza refugees into the U.S., and White House officials had been reportedly mulling such a decision at the time. Immigration experts who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation said a move to bring in Palestinian refugees would pose a serious national security threat, given the ties Gaza citizens have to Hamas, a designated terrorist group.

Recent surveys suggest a vast majority of Lebanese citizens hold extremist views. Roughly 80% of citizens in the country voiced support for the Oct. 7 massacre, according to a poll conducted by a Lebanese newspaper in the days immediately following Hamas’ terrorist attack. A report by the Washington Institute found that 79% of Lebanese citizens have a positive view of Hamas.

Illegal migrants continue to flood into the U.S. despite a recent decline in border crossings due to the prevalence of alternative modes of entry under the Biden-Harris administration, masquerading the true scope of the border crisis.

The number of recorded illegal border crossings has dropped significantly in the past few months following an executive order from President Joe Biden capping border entries, the most recent Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show. Despite the apparent easing, illegal migrants have continued to enter the U.S. through other means, such as the CBP One app and the CHNV program. (RELATED: Sex Trafficking Of Migrant Girls Has Exploded Under Biden-Harris Admin, Human Trafficking Expert Says)

“A lot of people are saying migration has halted. I dare say this is not the case,” stated Enrique Valenzuela, head of the Chihuahua Population Council, according to Border Report. “Here on this border, we find ourselves at somewhat of an impasse, where it would appear the flow of people stopped.”

“But we see there is more interest in coming in through CBP One,” Valenzuela continued, referencing an app that allows a large number of foreign nationals to apply for asylum daily. “We know because people come to us seeking help with the application.”

The CBP One app was first established in October 2020, with the Biden-Harris administration expanding its use in January 2023. The app enables migrants to schedule appointments in order to obtain exemptions at ports of entry, and permits them to submit biometric data to federal immigration authorities in order to apply for travel authorization and obtain parole.

More than 800,000 foreign nationals scheduled appointments through the CBP One app from January 2023 through the end of August 2024, according to CBP. The number of those being allowed in via the app almost rivals the number of Border Patrol encounters, with roughly 58,000 migrant apprehensions in August and 44,700 processed via the app that same month.

“All those people who make appointments with the CBP One app have no right to be in the United States,” Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, stated to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Biden-Harris administration has decided to allow in 1,400 of those people per day make those appointments.”

“And we know from congressional disclosures that 95.8% of everybody who uses the app ends up getting released into the country on parole and they’re placed into removal proceedings,” Arthur continued. “If you’re placed into removal proceedings with a Notice to Appear, you’re here illegally. That is the allegation that the government is making — you are removable from the United States.”

The Biden-Harris administration has also flown in more than half a million foreign nationals into the country via an initiative known as CHNV — a program that grants two-year parole to Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan nationals. The White House announced in October that those enrolled in the CHNV program, which has been plagued with widespread fraud, would not have their parole renewed.

Roughly 30,000 migrants were being flown into the U.S. a month via the CHNV parole program.

While these migrant initiatives have been taking place, the Biden-Harris administration has been enforcing an executive order first enacted in June that caps the number of daily unlawful encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy appears to be keeping illegal border crossings down, with monthly Border Patrol encounters in September reaching their lowest levels since President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris entered office, according to CBP data.

House Homeland Committee Chairman Mark Green, a frequent critic of the White House’s border policies, has referred to the CHNV program and the CBP One app as a “massive shell game” that has allowed the administration to tout lower border crossings while the number of otherwise inadmissible migrants entering the U.S. explodes.

The Mexican government, in the meantime, has been more ardently cracking down on U.S.-bound illegal migration through its country. However, critics remain skeptical of how long Mexican officials will continue to keep many of these migrants at bay.

Todd Bensman, also of the Center for Immigration Studies, filmed a large group of migrants in the southern Mexico city of Tapachula on Monday. He suggested that they are being kept away from the U.S. border for now, but may be making their way north after the election.

“Biden-Harris did THIS for election optics, in December got Mexico to haul thousands of immigrants here in Tapachula and sardine-can trap them to claim low US crossings and keep them off US media during the campaign,” Bensman stated. “Been here five times and never seen so many as this. Stay tuned.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.

The Biden Energy Department greenlit a conditional $670.6 million loan to aid in the construction of a manufacturing facility for a key component used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, according to a press release.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) offered the loan to Aspen Aerogels, a company that makes insulating materials for EVs, according to the Wednesday press release. The loan, if it is finalized, will help fund the construction of a new aerogel blanket manufacturing facility in Register, Georgia.

The aerogel blankets are used as a protective barrier in EV batteries to prevent fires and improve battery safety, according to the release.

The loan from the DOE is part of an ongoing push from the Biden-Harris administration to increase domestic manufacturing jobs and EV production. The administration announced in September that it was granting more than $3 billion for EV battery projects.

The project is expected to create up to 255 full-time operations jobs and 550 construction jobs, according to the release. The company has contracts to provide thermal barriers to several automakers, and the new manufacturing facility is also expected to supply the aerogel barriers for over 2 million EVs annually, according to Bloomberg.

“We are making sure that the supply side is made here in this country,” Director of the Energy Department Loan Programs Office Jigar Shah said according to Bloomberg’s report. “We have taken very seriously the onshoring of the entire supply chain.”

Shah reached a conditional loan commitment in July of over a billion dollars with Entek, a green technology company that has connections to his old trade group. House Republicans previously threatened Shah with a subpoena in January as part of a probe into his office.

The Biden-Harris administration has pushed funding for EV charging stations in the hopes to meet its goal of placing 500,000 stations across the U.S. by 2030, but the initiative has seen slow progress.

The U.S. EV market has faced steep competition from China. China placed export restrictions on graphite, a material needed for manufacturing EV batteries, in October 2023. (RELATED: California School District Goes All-In On Electric Buses While Students Struggle With Reading, Math)

Ford announced in September that it would offer free EV chargers and home installations in an attempt to attract consumers amid a struggling auto sales market. The resale value of used EVs has dropped amid a lack of consumer demand.

Georgia is considered a key swing state in this year’s presidential election. Former President Donald Trump is leading by 0.9 points at 48.7% against Vice President Kamala Harris’ 47.8%, according to polling averages by RealClearPolitics.

Nearly three months after Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose first sought access to federal citizenship verification records to help the Buckeye State ensure noncitizens don’t vote in the election, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has yet to respond.

In his defense, Mayorkas reportedly has been busy enjoying high-end sushi from posh Japanese restaurant chains and shopping in fashionable Georgetown boutiques.

LaRose says he has made several appeals to the Biden-Harris administration seeking access to DHS databases, “specifically the Person Centric Query Service (PCQS) database, the Person Centric Identity Services (PCIS) database, and the Central Index System.”

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has intervened on the secretary of state’s behalf, demanding answers from Mayorkas on his failure to assist LaRose in securing Ohio’s elections. Jordan, who serves as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the matter is particularly pressing “in light of the open-border policies of the Biden-Harris Administration” that have led to unprecedented millions of illegal immigrants pouring into the United States. As The Federalist has extensively reported, thousands of foreign nationals have shown up on voters rolls in states across the country, including hundreds of names this year that LaRose has ordered removed from Ohio’s voter registration database.

“Given Secretary LaRose’s state and federal statutory responsibilities to guarantee that only lawfully registered citizens vote in Ohio federal elections, his request for access to DHS’s citizenship verification databases is a ‘purpose authorized by law,’ and you must grant it accordingly,” Jordan wrote in the Sept. 27 letter to Mayorkas.

As the congressman noted, federal law requires DHS to respond to the LaRose’s requests. The specific code states the agency “shall respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, or local government agency, seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by law, by providing the requested verification or status information.”

In a statement to The Federalist, LaRose said he’s “tired of the stonewalling and delays from the Department of Homeland Security.”

“I’m sure it’s no coincidence that the Biden-Harris administration is pursuing the most porous border policy in our nation’s history while also ghosting us on our efforts to keep noncitizens from voting,” the Republican secretary of state said.

‘A Constitutional Duty’

Mayorkas’ intransigence in granting Ohio access to critical election integrity databases should come as no surprise from an administration led by a president who has threatened to veto legislation requiring documented proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. President Joe Biden’s threat proved unnecessary. While the Republican-led House passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, the legislation received minuscule support from Democrats. Meanwhile, the Democrat-controlled Senate refused to take up the measure.

Democrats have shrugged off growing concerns about the untold thousands of noncitizens on voter rolls across the country, insisting that it’s already illegal for noncitizens to vote in U.S. elections. Illegal immigration also is illegal, but that hasn’t stopped the Biden-Harris administration from opening the borders wide to historic numbers of illegal aliens.

What is unknown is how many foreign nationals have ended up on voter rolls thanks to “Bidenbucks,” Biden’s constitutionally suspect executive order using federal agencies as a get-out-the-vote machine for Democrats. The order allows White House-approved third-party organizations to help register and mobilize voters.

While Mayorkas stonewalls, Attorney General Merrick Garland is targeting states that have worked to clean their voter rolls of ineligible voters. The Department of Justice on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia after the commonwealth removed some 6,300 foreign nationals from its voter rolls between January 2022 and July 2024. DOJ’s complaint asserts such voter roll maintenance programs must occur no later than 90 days before an election, the so-called Quiet Period Provision.

Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the strong-arm tactic an “unprecedented lawsuit,” according to a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. Youngkin noted DOJ is targeting his state “for appropriately enforcing a Virginia law, signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine [a Democrat] in 2006, that requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls — a process that begins when an individual themselves indicates they are a noncitizen during a DMV transaction.”

Garland’s DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against Alabama late last month.

As the Biden-Harris administration goes after states for removing noncitizens from their voter databases, it refuses to work with states to verify voter eligibility. Why?

In his letter, Jordan asks Mayorkas to explain why he’s failed to respond to LaRose’s four requests for access to the federal citizen verification databases. Mayorkas already has failed to meet Jordan’s request that DHS provide access to the databases at least 30 days prior to the Nov. 5 presidential election, “as required by law.” Mayorkas, who in February became the first cabinet secretary in nearly 150 years to be impeached, also has failed to turn over documents and communications relating to LaRose’s request.

“I have a constitutional duty to ensure that noncitizens aren’t participating in Ohio’s elections, and the federal government is legally obligated to provide this information,” Ohio’s secretary of state said. “I appreciate Congressman Jordan’s willingness to stand with me in demanding answers.”

The Biden-Harris administration is conducting an election interference campaign in Virginia by filing a lawsuit to ensure noncitizens remain on the voter rolls, but the commonwealth’s own Department of Elections (ELECT) has been complicit in registering ineligible voters for over a decade, according to one county Republican Party.

While the Biden-Harris election meddling comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., removed 6,303 noncitizens from voter rolls between January 2022 and July 2024, the Fairfax County Republican Party noted that “from at least 2011” and “enabled by the Department of Motor Vehicles,” “Virginia bureaucrats allowed thousands of noncitizens onto Virginia’s voter rolls.”

The Fairfax GOP is fully supportive of Youngkin’s Executive Order 35, which removed the noncitizens, prompting the left-wing lawfare assault against the enforcement of Virginia’s constitutional requirement that an eligible voter be a “citizen of the United States.” Fairfax GOP Chairwoman Katie Gorka said that “Youngkin is defending the citizens of the commonwealth by cleaning up our voter rolls.”

Gorka told The Federalist, however, that “we feel very, very, very supportive of Governor Youngkin, that he has taken this stance. But I’ll tell you the other thing, only 6,303 have been removed from the voter rolls: I think the number is in the tens-of-thousands of those who should be removed from the voter rolls. And that’s why, we are both supporting Governor Youngkin, but saying we need to do more.”

In a scathing press release, the Fairfax GOP, which represents the commonwealth’s largest county by population, said that government bureaucrats dating back at least to the administration Virginia’s last Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, who took office in 2010, helped noncitizens register to vote illegally.

For a decade between 2013 and May of 2023, the DMV never provided ELECT with document numbers from noncitizens legally present in the United States, according to the press release. Using the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, those numbers are instrumental in allowing ELECT to verify the citizenship status of individuals registering to vote.

Furthermore, before August, when Youngkin issued Executive Order 35, ELECT did not use SAVE for verifying the citizenship of both new voter registrants and those already registered to vote, despite the fact that ELECT has had access to SAVE since 2014, the press release added.

ELECT missed yet another verification capability available to it, according to the release, by declining to cross-reference the Social Security Numbers of voter registrations that do not come from the DMV with the Social Security Administration to make sure the numbers and names match federal records.

“We have hundreds of election workers and poll watchers to help protect the integrity of this election, but there is no way for us to verify if the people voting are citizens, because the DMV and ELECT keep that information hidden from the people they claim to serve—the citizens of Virginia,” Gorka said in the press release.

ELECT did not return a request for comment from The Federalist.

Institutional powers have stood in the way of basic election integrity standards for over a decade in Virginia, and it should be no surprise that far-left actors in the government and political activist power structure have been attacking Youngkin’s move to make sure noncitizens are not voting.

Not only has the Biden-Harris administration filed a suit to keep illegals voting, but the government has effectively joined forces with left-wing nonprofits, the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia, which filed a separate lawsuit.

“They want illegal immigrants to be able to vote” Gorka told The Federalist, adding Democrats want to obtain illegal votes because they are afraid of losing the commonwealth. “Virginia is absolutely in play. And I’ll tell you what I think is a really significant factor in Virginia: Is the Hispanic vote. We have a really large Hispanic population in Virginia and everywhere around the country, we are seeing them shift in significant numbers away from the Democrats and over to the Republicans. So, you put all this together, I think Virginia is not a positive scenario for the Democrats. They’re worried, and so, yes, they are fighting to keep every possible illegal on the voter rolls.”

Over the summer, the Trump campaign recognized that Virginia, which last voted for a Republican for president in George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign, looked more winnable that it had in the past. The campaign at the time opened 11 new offices in the commonwealth.

Republicans also have major races for U.S. Senate, between Republican Hung Cao and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and U.S. House, with all eyes on Virginia’s open 7th District, between Derrick Anderson and Democrat Eugene Vindman, and Virginia’s 2nd District between Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Democrat challenger Missy Cotter Smasal.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) quietly revised its crime data for 2022, less than three weeks until the Nov. 5 election and conveniently after presidential and vice presidential debates.

Vice President Kamala Harris must be breathing a sigh of relief knowing that the FBI waited until the last possible moment to correct the nation’s 2023 violent crime data report. It initially reported that the rate fell by 2.1% in 2022 but has since been updated to show it actually increased by 4.5%, proving Republicans’ claims that violent crime is plaguing the nation.

The FBI finally admits in the new data that there were thousands more murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults under the Biden-Harris administration — something former President Donald Trump has repeatedly brought up throughout his 2024 campaign. (ROOKE: Harris’ Obsession With Dems’ Strongest Issue Will Cost Her Election)

Trump argued in his September debate against Harris that crime rates were rising, adding that the FBI was using fraudulent data to sell the American people a lie about the growing violence in our cities. “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,” ABC News’s David Muir said, “fact-checking” Trump.

Three weeks before an election — and after the debates — FBI revises their crime statistics — showing crime increased by 4.5% in 2022 instead of dropping 2.1%. Here is ABC’s David Muir “fact checking” Trump in front of millions of viewers with lies that will never be retracted. pic.twitter.com/3N88pjn4g4 — Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) October 16, 2024

One month later, even the FBI (albeit quietly and without even a smidge of mea culpa) admits that Trump was right. Still, the damage has been done. The election is only 20 days away, and some states have already started early voting and accepting mail-in ballots. If the point was to meddle in the 2024 election to give Harris an easy out on rising crime, the FBI did its job well. (ROOKE: While Hurricane Victims Suffer, Kamala Makes Time For Podcast Famous For Giving Girls Blowjob Advice)

The agency, embroiled in several public biases against conservatives and whistleblowers, tried to make the correction as tactically as possible. At the bottom of the third page of the report, a footnote simply states: “The 2022 violent crime rate has been updated for inclusion in CIUS, 2023.” It appears to have made absolutely no mention of the fact that the “update” showed the rate rising significantly.

Thousands of Americans have already voted, some with the false idea that the violent chaos plaguing major cities is just a manufactured talking point from the Trump campaign. It seems to be yet another example of “Don’t believe your lying eyes” that we’ve become so accustomed to seeing from our government.

In the Presidential debate Trump said crime was up under Harris The moderator fact checked him claiming the FBI’s data says crime was down The FBI just quietly updated their 2022 crime stats and it turns out Trump was right This has happened so many times https://t.co/KQ1UhmzYik — Shaun Maguire (@shaunmmaguire) October 16, 2024

If it’s not lies about crime statistics, it’s job reports, FEMA using funds for illegal immigrants or President Joe Biden definitely not declining cognitively. Luckily for Trump, Americans are less likely to believe the federal government now than they were ten years ago. The reality is that local reports of gangs taking over apartment complexes, elderly adults being assaulted near the train and little girls being sexually assaulted and killed aren’t easily covered up just because the FBI claims they aren’t happening.

Still, any interference in the 2024 election, whether intentional or unintentional, creates confusion and hurts voters’ ability to make informed decisions when they enter the ballot box. The FBI gave Harris breathing room on important issues that she didn’t deserve. The Biden-Harris administration should have to answer to the American people for allowing this chaos to go on for the last four years and lying about it whenever they are confronted.

The reality is that Harris needed a helping hand, and the FBI gave her one.
The Biden-Harris administration now admits that an Afghan national accused of plotting an Election Day terror attack did not undergo certain vetting they previously claimed he passed.

Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, was never vetted or approved by the State Department for special immigrant (SIV) status, though officials from other agencies had claimed he cleared that stringent process.

Additionally, sources familiar with the investigation tell Fox News that Tawhedi was not well known to the U.S. government when the administration facilitated his departure to the states, despite his security role with the CIA in Afghanistan. Fox News has learned Tawhedi was employed as a local guard outside the base perimeter and he would not have been among the most thoroughly vetted U.S. partners.



The news upends claims officials made last week that Tawhedi was vetted three times: first to work for the CIA in Afghanistan, then to come to the U.S. on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) humanitarian parole during the withdrawal and a third time when he was approved for special immigrant (SIV) status after arriving in the U.S.

AFGHAN ISIS TERROR PLOT: BIDEN ADMIN AGENCIES POINT FINGERS AS LAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS

Officials now acknowledge Tawhedi was never vetted or approved for special immigrant (SIV) status, a thorough State Department process which can take years to complete. The State Department has maintained all along it had no role in Tawhedi’s refugee status, despite what a DHS case agent told investigators – leading to its inaccurate mention in the DOJ criminal complaint.



Last week, Biden administration officials defended the error, explaining that Tawhedi first entered the country on DHS humanitarian parole – which had its own vetting process – but later applied for SIV status, subjecting him to another round of vetting which he also cleared. Those same officials now admit that claim was wrong, and Tawhedi was never vetted or approved for SIV.



However, officials now say Tawhedi was subjected to "recurrent" vetting as part of his DHS humanitarian parole under Operation Allies Welcome – but this raises new questions.



DHS has repeatedly stated that no red flags were identified at any point in Tawhedi’s vetting, but three sources forcefully disputed DHS’ characterization of the vetting process as "thorough."

AFGHAN CHARGED WITH ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT RAISES QUESTIONS, FEARS FROM LAWMAKERS: ‘THIS IS REAL’

According to a 2022 DHS Inspector General Report, DHS did not provide data or evidence to support its claim that "recurrent vetting processes were established for all paroled Afghan evacuees for the duration of their parole period." The report also stated that DHS admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the United States, in many cases because information used to vet evacuees through U.S. Government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing.



The 2022 audit by the DHS Office of the Inspector General revealed 417 records with a first name unknown, 242 records with a last name unknown and 11,110 records with a birthdate recorded as "January 1." Additionally, 36,400 travel records listed "facilitation document" as the document type, and 7,800 records had invalid or missing document numbers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not maintain a list of individuals paroled or admitted into the country without proper identification.

MAYORKAS REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON AFGHAN ACCUSED OF ELECTION DAY TERROR PLOT



Recurrent vetting was initiated by CBP for Operation Allies Welcome parolees prior to their arrival in the United States. CBP shared biographical information collected during the initial screening and vetting process with the National Vetting Center (NVC) and designated Vetting Support Agencies (VSAs) – external to DHS – for recurrent vetting against classified information in NVC and VSA data holdings.



DHS stated in the 2024 final report that "the National Vetting Center recurrent vetting is ongoing and active for all OAW parolees", but the agency has also told Fox News, "Vetting is a point-in-time check that evaluates information available to the U.S. Government at that time."

DHS says "If individuals who have entered the country are later found to be associated with information indicating a potential national security or public safety concern, DHS and our federal partners investigate and take appropriate action in keeping with the mission of protecting the homeland."

Prosecutors say Tawhedi obtained firearms and ammunition to conduct a violent attack on U.S. soil, as well as taking a number of steps to prepare for the alleged plot. He is charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.



Investigators are still working to determine whether Tawhedi was radicalized before or after coming to the U.S.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “OutFront,” Andrew Kaczynski, the Senior Editor of CNN’s KFile discussed his reporting and stated that 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris has gone from threatening prosecutions of oil companies the last time she ran for president to now touting oil production and stated that “she has flip-flopped on a lot of issues related to energy.” Kaczynski also attributed these flips to polling that shows climate change ranks towards the bottom of issues that are important to voters and the fact that Pennsylvania is a crucial state in the election.

Host Erin Burnett began by stating that the campaign is touting oil and natural gas production and “this is a very sharp turn from where Harris once stood on this issue not so very long ago.”

She then said to Kaczynski, “So, Andrew, pounding the table for the U.S. oil industry and oil production, but not the way it always was. What did you find?”

Kaczynski responded, “Yeah, that’s right, Erin. And this really shows sort of just how far left Kamala Harris got in that 2019 Democratic primary when she was running with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), she was making this extremely bold promise that she was going to take the U.S. oil industry, possibly criminally prosecute them for their role in climate change. She compared it to big tobacco, saying they knew the effects of climate change, but they hid it from the public. Now, what we saw there, fast forward to 2024, what are her and Tim Walz doing? They are touting the record domestic oil production from those same oil companies during the Biden-Harris administration.”

Burnett then said, “Obviously, that is extremely different than what she is presenting right now. But this isn’t the only thing that she’s flipped on that you found, and you found a lot of other inconsistencies.”

Kaczynski responded, “Yeah, she has flip-flopped on a lot of issues related to energy. … She said she was going to ban plastic straws. She said she was going to ban fracking — we have heard a lot about that –, and she said she would eliminate the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. … And now why is she doing this, Erin? Well, a recent poll that came out from Gallup actually shows that climate change ranks as the second least important issue to voters in that poll. And obviously, Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of the fracking stuff, is a very important state.”

FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., who led the Senate introduction of the Laken Riley Act alongside Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., hit former President Bill Clinton for failing to acknowledge during his remarks about the border crisis "that this is a conscious choice the Biden-Harris Administration has made."

In a campaign visit to Georgia on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., Clinton invoked the February death of Laken Riley, an Augusta University nursing student who was found dead on the University of Georgia's campus.

The suspect charged with allegedly murdering Riley, Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old illegal immigrant, has pleaded not guilty.

SENATE DEMS TARGET BLACK VOTERS WITH NEW AD AS HARRIS’ SUPPORT FALLS SHORT

"[Harris is] the only candidate who has actually endorsed a bill that would hold down immigration any given year to a certain point and then made sure we gave people a decent place to live, didn't divide people from their children. And we did total vetting before people got in. Now, Trump killed the bill," Clinton said during the campaign stop.

"You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about it. A young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened."

In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, Britt said, "Laken Riley would be alive today if the Biden-Harris Administration had stronger border security and interior immigration enforcement policies in place. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have willfully, recklessly, and unlawfully allowed poorly vetted individuals, including Laken Riley’s accused murderer, to unleash havoc on American families nationwide."

"What President Clinton refused to admit is that this is a conscious choice the Biden-Harris Administration has made," she continued. "No one is forcing them to parole hundreds of thousands of poorly vetted individuals into communities across our country, and they could end their dangerous, unprecedented abuse of immigration parole today if they wanted to."

Britt also slammed the extensive executive actions by the administration that she said, "weakened border security and immigration enforcement."

"They suspended deportations, halted construction of the border wall, and announced a plan to give amnesty to millions. That made it crystal clear from the start of their tenure that their goal was mass migration – not the safety and security of the American people."

The Alabama senator criticized her Democrat counterparts in the Senate for blocking "the commonsense, bipartisan Laken Riley Act and instead defend[ing] the Biden-Harris mass migration agenda – the very agenda that senselessly enabled the murders of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and countless others."

"I’m going to continue fighting to pass this important legislation and return President Trump to the White House, so he can restore the strong border policies that were working under his Administration."

Britt and Budd's measure would require illegal immigrants who commit crimes such as theft, burglary, larceny or shoplifting to be arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Further, the detainment of said illegal immigrants would be mandated until removal from the country can be coordinated.

The bill would also establish standing for states to bring civil action against federal officials that do not enforce immigration law or violate the law.

The measure is co-sponsored by nearly every member of the Senate Republican conference and one Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who joined in the summer after initially opposing a modified version of the bill being included in a several bill appropriations package earlier in the year.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation quietly updated its 2022 crime data to show an increase in violent crimes, despite previous data showing violent crimes had fallen that year, which was touted as a victory for the Biden-Harris administration.

"For some reason, the media, they did pick the crime data that they think goes and makes the Democrats look as good as possible. And then even when the crime data that they've relied on turns out by the very source of that data to be wrong, none of them fix it," John Lott, the founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week.

The FBI released its annual crime in the nation data for 2022 last year, which found a 2.1% decrease in violent crimes compared to 2021, Lott explained. The data was lauded by Democrats and the media as part of a turning point for crime woes in the U.S., following the crime wave of 2020, when defund-the-police protests and riots swept the nation and the pandemic’s stay-at-home orders upended daily life.

Now, the data reflects a net increase of 80,029 violent crimes in 2022 over 2021. Lott found that under the umbrella of violent crime, there were an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies and 37,091 aggravated assaults that year.

VIOLENT CRIMES HAVE INCREASED UNDER BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN DESPITE DEMS' DENIALS: EXPERT

"To give people an idea of the size of the change, when the 2022 data came out in September 2023, they initially reported that violent crime had fallen by 2.1% in 2022.… That's the final data, supposedly, for 2022. The revision of that final data that came out last month, now claims that rather than the 2.1% drop, that there was actually a 4.5% increase in violent crime that occurred in 2022. That's a 6.6 percentage point change there," Lott told Fox News Digital.

"It's from a drop to an increase. And, you know, the bizarre thing to me is, for a year after the 2022 data was put out, we were having headlines, news articles after news articles saying, 'Violent crime is falling, people mistakenly or erroneously believe that it's increasing.' And, you know, and they were relying on this data. But you don't see any corrections in the news. Saying, ‘Oops, the FBI data that we relied on was wrong, that rather than a drop, there was actually an increase that had occurred,’" he added.

'WEAK-ON-CRIME LIBERAL': TRUMP CAMPAIGN HITS BACK AFTER HARRIS BLAMES HIM FOR 'VIOLENT CRIME WAVE'

President Biden and the Harris campaign have touted that violent crimes had fallen under their leadership, with Biden calling the reported violent crime drops "historic" while citing the FBI’s most recent data.

"This year, the homicide and violent crime rates have continued their rapid decline from their peaks during the last administration," Biden said in an official White House statement late last month. "... Communities across our country are safer now than when I took office."

"Americans are safer today than when Vice President Harris and I took office. We can’t stop now," Biden added in a separate White House statement in August touting crime data from an independent organization of police chiefs across the nation .

The Trump campaign, when asked about the revised data, took a victory lap, saying, "President Trump was right…. AGAIN!"

"The federal government lied about Biden’s cognitive decline, lied about the job numbers, and now we learn they lied about crime numbers too," Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. "Kamala Harris must admit she’s wrong and address how she plans to bring down the rising crime crisis. Every mainstream media reporter who was quick to correct President Trump must cover this new revelation if they have any shred of integrity left."

Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that "crime in this country is through the roof" under the Biden-Harris administration, despite the previous figures promoted by the FBI showing violent crime was allegedly on a downward trend.

When asked about the revision, the White House argued that following the passage of the American Rescue Plan in 2021 under the Biden-Harris administration, violent crime is "at a near 50-year low."

"Under the previous administration, our country saw the biggest increase in murder rates on record. President Biden and Vice President Harris immediately got to work to turn it around and passed the American Rescue Plan, which led to the largest ever federal investment in public safety. As a result, violent crime is at a near 50-year low, and is continuing to decline this year according independent data from police chiefs in the nation’s largest cities," White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

An administration official added in a comment to Fox Digital that the "FBI often adjusts crime estimates as more data is reported."

"During the prior administration, the FBI upwardly adjusted crime data during its last three years: in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These adjustments are standard practice," the official continued before citing an article on the data this week. "Real Clear Investigations fails to mention that, in 2021, there was a sharp decline in the number of agencies participating in FBI data collection because the FBI temporarily disallowed an earlier collection method. The FBI switched back to its prior method in 2022."

Lott explained he noticed the quiet update when the FBI released its 2023 crime data set last month, adding: "It was pretty easy to see that things had changed."

"For 2022 and 2021 in particular, they had some changes for a few of the previous years, but they were very small. The changes for 2021 and 2022 were very large. You know, I looked through the press release that the FBI had put out, there was no mention of them having changed the data for earlier years. And surely no mention of the large change that had occurred. I looked through the Uniform Crime Report summary report that the FBI puts out, and there was no mention of the size of the change. There's one footnote there that vaguely mentions that they had updated the data for 2022. No mention about updating it for 2021 or any other time," he said, calling the discovery "shocking."

The data update is akin to when the Bureau of Labor Statistics overestimated the number of jobs created in the U.S. by 818,000 between March 2023 and March of this year, Lott said.

Lott authored an article on the data for Real Clear Investigations this week, which argued the updates to 2022 stats open the door to questioning if the 2023 stats showing an estimated 3% drop in violent crimes compared to 2022 are legitimate.

"Without the increase, the drop in violent crime in 2023 would have been less than half as large — only 1.6% instead of the reported drop of 3.5%," Lott wrote.

While FBI data has shown alleged drops in violent crimes in recent years, other government data sets have shown crime has increased in the last few years.

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN SAYS CRIME IS DOWN, BUT INDEPENDENT DATA SHOWS VIOLENT CRIME UP ACROSS 66 CITIES

Crimes such as rape or sexual assault, aggravated assault and robbery increased from 2020 to 2023, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed last month as part of its National Crime Victimization Survey. Across the board, the survey found total instances of reported violent crimes increased from 5.6 per 1,000 individuals aged 12 and over in 2020, when Trump was still in office, to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023.

PUBLIC SAFETY GROUP FINDS FBI VIOLENT CRIME DATA IS HIGHER THAN INITIALLY REPORTED

Lott, who also served as a senior adviser for research and statistics at the DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs, authored an op-ed for Real Clear Politics last month and detailed that the DOJ survey found that total violent crimes are 55.4% higher in 2023 than in 2020, the end of Trump's tenure, while rape crimes increased by 42%, robbery by 63% and aggravated assault by 55%. The DOJ survey does not include surveys on murder, but that category is almost always reported to police departments , and subsequently to the FBI, he noted, and makes up about 1% of the U.S.' total violent crimes.

Fox News Digital reached out to the FBI and Harris campaign regarding the 2022 data but did not immediately receive replies.

The FBI said in comment to Fox News later Wednesday evening that it stands by "each of our Crime in the Nation publications."

"In 2022, the estimated violent crime rate decreased 1.7 percent from 2021. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program transitioned from the traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the more comprehensive National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for the 2021 data collection year. A significant number of agencies were unable to complete the transition to NIBRS in 2021. Due to the lower volume of participation, the FBI was unable to produce the traditional national estimates for 2021. To provide a confident comparison of crime trends across the nation, the UCR Program performed a NIBRS estimation crime trend analysis. The analysis used NIBRS estimation data of violent and property crimes from 2020 and 2021. In 2022, the FBI resumed collecting SRS data in addition to NIBRS to present nationally representative data. In order to compile reliable estimates for the yearly trend, the FBI used a statistical sampling of 2021 data to augment the 2021 information collected via NIBRS for the 2022 publication."

The agency continued that the release of Crime in the Nation, 2023, last month "was the first phase in the FBI’s efforts to provide the public with more timely data."

" The next phase will see a shift to monthly data releases to promote transparency and provide an opportunity for consumers to review data based on more timely crime counts with the understanding that data will be continuously updated. As part of this movement, the FBI has moved towards automation, allowing for past years’ estimates to be updated as data are submitted. Therefore, 2021 counts now showing in the 20-year estimation tables reflect only estimates based on the data directly reported to the FBI. This explains why the figure appears different than the computed estimation published in the Crime in the Nation, 2022," the agency continued.
Longtime Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick sparred over "lies" during their second debate on Tuesday, with McCormick saying he won't "take any preaching" from his Democratic rival.

"I'm not going to take any preaching from a guy who spent 30 years in public office and hasn't gotten much done. So I'm not going to take any preaching from you, Bob Casey, on that. And your lies, which are completely unworthy of you and your family and your service," McCormick said Tuesday evening, while directing his attention to Casey.

McCormick's remarks came as the two were questioned about their views on the escalating war in the Middle East, with Casey claiming McCormick, while working at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, invested funds in a Chinese arms manufacturer.

"We've got to continue to support Israel's efforts, not just to defend itself, but to take the fight to those terrorists that are threatening them every single day. And I'll continue to support Israel, as I always have," Casey said regarding the war in Israel.

"But a big difference in this race is, while I was doing that, supporting Israel all these years, my opponent was running that hedge fund in Connecticut. The largest hedge fund in the world. I mentioned the investments in China and Russia. He also invested in a Chinese arms manufacturer that had ties to Iran, and those weapons that they produced made their way to Hamas. That is disqualifying," Casey said while discussing his support of Israel amid its ongoing war against Hamas.

'LIES THROUGHOUT': TRUMP-BACKED CHALLENGER, LONGTIME DEM SENATOR FACE OFF IN HEATED BATTLEGROUND DEBATE

McCormick shot back that Casey has consistently "lied" about his record and encouraged Pennsylvania voters to visit a website called CaseyLies.com for more information.

"I just want to say, I'm not going to take any preaching as a guy who went to West Point, went to Ranger school, was the honor graduate, went to the 82nd Airborne Division, went into Iraq in the first wave – when it looked like there will be tens of thousands of casualties – I'm not going to take any preaching," McCormick shot back.

Casey commended McCormick for his military service, while adding "he's just preaching at me."

"When Mr. McCormick said I was preaching, he's just preaching at me. He mentioned his service. It's commendable service to the people of our country. But this isn't a race about his service or what we were doing at that age in our life. It's about my work in the United States Senate and his work as a hedge fund CEO. And he doesn't like the fact that I talk about his record as a hedge fund CEO," Casey said.

The pair took the same debate stage for the second time this campaign cycle on Tuesday evening, where they sparred over abortion, immigration and the economy. The 60-minute debate was hosted by 6ABC in Philadelphia, and was moderated by Action News anchors Matt O'Donnell and Sharrie Williams, and Univision 65's Ilia Garcia.

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

Casey has served in the Senate since 2008, ultimately becoming a stalwart within the Democratic Party, voting on legislation President Biden supported, for example, 98.5% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight data.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

The longtime senator, however, is facing what is described as his most difficult re-election effort to date.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the under secretary of commerce for industry and security as well as under secretary of the treasury for international affairs under President George W. Bush’s administration.

The race was rated as "leans Democrat" by Fox News Power Rankings , with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a "close, tough race."

McCormick continued to defend his record as Bridgewater's CEO and its investments, citing that they were approved by the U.S. government.

"I ran a great investment firm. It invested around the world, as many investment firms do. It had exposure to China. All the investments that were made were approved by the U.S. government. But the richness of a career politician. Bob Casey, as the treasurer of Pennsylvania, approved using Bridgewater, which was the firm I worked with and for, before I ever got there. All these investments that were happening, were happening under Bob Casey as treasurer," he said, which Casey said was "not true."

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

During the debate, McCormick painted Casey as an out of touch career politician who has overwhelmingly voted in line with the Democratic Party, and who has flip-flopped on policies in order to keep pace with the party's harder swing to the left. McCormick notably took issue with Casey's "flip-flop" on abortion.

"There is no senator in the United States Senate who has flip-flopped more on this issue than Sen. Casey. Sen. Casey, previously as a senator, said that he wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Sen. Casey said that there should be only one exception: Life of the mother. Sen. Casey was one of the most pro-life senators in the Senate, and he has now moved his position, flip-flopped his position," McCormick said.

Casey characterized McCormick as a Keystone State outsider and out-of-touch former CEO who spent years living in Connecticut before launching the 2024 campaign.

"He's also the candidate in this race, when he was a hedge fund CEO, who invested millions of dollars in the largest producer of fentanyl in China. And Chinese fentanyl is coming to our country," Casey argued. McCormick has previously pushed back that Bridgewater's investments in a Chinese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany was for fentanyl's le­git­i­mate med­i­cal use, not illicit products.

At a later portion of the debate, McCormick shot back that deaths attributed to fentanyl in the U.S. last year alone equated to "two Vietnam" wars, pinning blame on Casey.

"Meanwhile, 116,000 people died last year from fentanyl on your watch," McCorimick said. "That's two Vietnams. Eight years of war in Vietnam, 58,000.… The fact that you and Biden and Harris aren't standing up and taking accountability is a true disgrace."

Political eyes have been locked on Pennsylvania this election cycle after it yet again emerged as a key battleground state for the presidential race this cycle. Former President Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.
Vice President Kamala Harris is facing criticism for touting oil production under the Biden administration after becoming the Democratic nominee, while previously calling for such companies to "pay the price" for climate change.

During her 2019 presidential bid, Harris told voters that she was in favor of the Department of Justice investigating oil companies, such as Chevron and Shell, for "profiting off" pollution.

"These big oil companies, these fossil fuel companies, look, you should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime. Because here’s the thing, these big oil companies and these fossil fuel companies have been making so much money and profiting off of this pollution," Harris said.

Yet, after becoming the Democratic nominee, the vice president began touting the "largest increase in domestic oil production in history" under the Biden-Harris administration.

CNN SEGMENT PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON KAMALA HARRIS' FLIP-FLOP ON FAR-LEFT POSITIONS

"My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil," Harris said during the one and only presidential debate against former President Trump in swing state Pennsylvania.

"I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels," Harris said.

Fox News Digital asked the Harris campaign whether she still supported investigating big oil for pollution, but did not receive a response.

HARRIS DODGING FLIP FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: ‘PLAYING POLITICS’

CNN called out Harris for flipping on the issue since becoming the Democratic nominee.

"This is a very sharp turn from where Harris once stood on this issue not so very long ago," host Erin Burnett said on Wednesday.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz, who signed a bill in 2023 to mandate utilities produce 100% carbon-free power by 2040, echoed her most recent stance on the issue.

"America’s producing more natural gas and more oil than at any time in our history," Walz said during a recent interview with WGAL 8.

The U.S. Oil and Gas Association (OGA) slammed Harris' resurfaced comment from the debate, saying Harris had "nothing to do" with domestic oil production growth.

CNN SEGMENT PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON KAMALA HARRIS' FLIP-FLOP ON FAR-LEFT POSITIONS

"In just four years, you and POTUS created the single worst regulatory and legislative environment in our industry's 160-year history. You've put into place 250 separate actions designed to put us out of business. You wanted to put our CEOs in jail, confiscate our capital and prevent our investors from getting any return," OGA wrote in a post on X formerly Twitter, on Wednesday. "And in spite of all that – we worked around you, over you and have beat your team. Now you want to take credit for what we did in spite of you. Not gonna let it happen."

Representatives from the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) said Harris' acknowledgment of an oil production boost means that a strong U.S. oil and natural gas industry is good for the U.S. economy.

"This election season, Vice President Harris is taking credit for production records because she knows we need more energy, not less. Despite her policies and remarks derived from environmentalists' talking points about shutting down our industry, I believe Harris also knows American oil and natural gas producers have the cleanest oil and natural gas operations in the world and adhere to the highest environmental and safety standards," Jeff Eshelman, IPAA president and CEO, told Fox News Digital. "The United States needs the energy, and we should not rely on foreign adversaries as the Vice President said."

Harris recently shifted her stance on fracking, coming out in support of the method this cycle after saying that "there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking" during a CNN town hall in 2020.
WASHINGTON CROSSING, Pennsylvania — As she ramps up her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in her battle with former President Trump for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday took a two-pronged approach.

The Democratic presidential nominee teamed up in battleground Pennsylvania with more than 100 anti-Trump Republicans, including one of the most vocal and visible, former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.

Following her campaign event at the historic park where George Washington crossed the Delaware River on Christmas night 1776 — a turning point moment in the American Revolutionary War — the vice president will sit down with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier for an interview that will run on "Special Report" at 6 p.m. ET.

With less than three weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

HARRIS RAMPS UP OUTREACH TO BLACK MEN AS TRUMP MAKES GAINS

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Kinzinger, who flew missions as a pilot in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and later served a dozen years as a conservative member of Congress, had a prominent speaking role at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, when Harris gave her nomination acceptance speech.

"As a military guy, I've always respected strength in leadership. Donald Trump is the opposite of that. He is a weak, small, tiny man who is scared to death," Kinzinger charged.

Kinzinger was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to prevent the Congressional certification of the 2020 election.

The other was former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the one-time rising conservative star among House Republicans who became a leading GOP crusader against Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Biden.

Cheney formally endorsed Harris as the two teamed up at a campaign event in swing state Wisconsin two weeks ago.

The vice president on Wednesday was also joined at her event in Bucks County — a key swing county north of Philadelphia — by former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstack of Virginia, Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, Denver Riggleman of Virginia, Chris Shays of Connecticut and David Trott of Michigan, as well as former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former aides who served in the Trump administration.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

As she did at her event with Cheney, Harris spotlighted the importance of patriotism and upholding the Constitution in a bipartisan call for putting country above party in this election.

Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has also endorsed Harris.

Harris is also backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominees, respectively. She is also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Pointing to the Republicans standing behind her on the stage on Wednesday, Harris said "we are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country over party."

"At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States," she emphasized.

Harris also asserted there's "a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He, who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. And make no mistake, he, who, if given the chance, will violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and he refused to accept the will of the people."

The Trump campaign fired back.

"It’s quite pathetic to see former ‘Republicans’ of the past dug up out of irrelevance to have one last moment in the sun by campaigning for another four years of unlimited illegal immigration, rising prices, and endless wars under Kamala Harris. Fortunately, as with any other theatrical prop, they’re all going to be tossed aside the moment they stop being useful for Democrats — which will be November 5th, when President Trump is re-elected by Pennsylvanians," Trump campaign Pennsylvania spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News.



HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH CHENEY AT BIRTHPLACE OF THE GOP

Following Wednesday's event, the vice president is expected to sit with Baier for approximately 25–30 minutes at around 5 p.m. ET, about an hour before "Special Report" airs live.

"We are going to run it uninterrupted, unedited, all the way," Baier said on the eve of the interview.

The vice president's first formal interview on Fox News will give her a chance to speak directly to viewers across the ideological spectrum who normally do not watch the rival cable news networks CNN and MSNBC.

"Special Report" is regularly among the most-watched programs on cable news, and the show's "Common Ground" segment features political leaders from across the aisle discussing the issues of the day with the goal of finding compromise.

"We have a lot of eyeballs. We have Democrats, independents and Republicans," Baier said. "We have the biggest cable news audience. And this is probably going to get a lot more eyeballs. I think tough but fair is what I pitched it as. And I think that's what they're going to see."

Harris largely avoided interviews after replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July. Her first formal sit-down interview with CNN did not happen until late August. However, she has ramped up her media appearances in recent weeks, including interviews with CBS News' "60 Minutes," ABC's "The View," late night talk show host Stephen Colbert, radio personality Howard Stern and numerous podcasts. Most of those encounters were perceived as friendly interviews.

The interview with Baier on Fox News, however, may feed the perception that the vice president in the closing stretch of the campaign is open to facing tough questions.

"She knows there are going to be hard questions. She can handle those," seasoned Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer told Fox News. "Going through that process and handling that, you're kind of going behind enemy lines a little bit."

Harris will be the first Democratic presidential nominee in eight years to sit for an interview on Fox News, when Hillary Clinton spoke with Chris Wallace in 2016.

However, leading Harris surrogates — including Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — have made high-profile appearances on Fox News this summer and autumn.

Additionally, Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was interviewed on "Fox News Sunday" the past two weekends.

The Harris sit-down with Baier comes the same day that Fox News ran a town hall with Trump , with the former president fielding questions on issues such as abortion and child care from an all-female audience.

The program, recorded on Tuesday in battleground Georgia, ran Wednesday morning on "The Faulkner Focus."
Controversy overshadowed the U.K. Mini Series pool championships this past weekend, as transgender competitors Harriet Haynes and Lucy Smith were allowed to play. Both Haynes and Smith are biological males.

Haynes and Smith ended up facing off against eachother in the semifinals after each of them defeated a string of biologically female opponents. Haynes won that match, advancing to the final. There, Welsh woman Kirsty-Lee Davies was the last thing standing in between Haynes and claiming the title in the women's event.

Haynes took an early five-frames-to-two lead over Davies to reach the brink of that title. But just then, Davies pulled off a win to stave off elimination, sparking a streak of four straight frame wins to complete the comeback and claim the championship.

The Women’s Rights Network applauded Davies for her victory, writing: "Despite the best efforts of the pool authorities to scupper her chances by allowing two males to compete in the female category." However, the WRN also pointed out that both Haynes and Smith, for making it all the way to the final and semi-final respectively, will pick up prize money that "rightfully belongs to a woman."

The rules of both the English Pool Association and World Eightball Pool Federation (WEPF) state that trans-identified athletes are allowed to compete in the sport with absolutely no restrictions, according to their website . Those bylaws for the EPA have been under review since December 2023.

In August 2023, the WEPF announced it was updating their guidelines to only allow those who were "born female" to play the sport.

"We understand that this decision may prompt questions and discussions within our sport. We want to emphasize that our commitment to upholding the values of sportsmanship, inclusivity, and adherence to regulatory standards remains unwavering," the WEPF said at the time. "Our ultimate goal is to ensure the continued growth and development of the sport we all love, while maintaining a harmonious balance between inclusivity and the integrity of competition. We recognize the importance of fostering an environment where everyone can participate and thrive, and we remain dedicated to upholding these principles to the best of our ability."

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

But then, in October that year, the WEPF reversed that protection. It allowed transgenders to compete by enabling their participation under the conditioner that they have identified as female for a minimum of four years, and further submit proof of lowered testosterone levels.

Transgender participation in women's sports has become an internationally debated issue, and it has become one of the most-discussed issues of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether trans athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex, and 65% answered that it should either be never or rarely be allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult trans female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it.

Former president Trump has taken a firm stance against transgender inclusion in his campaign for the White House. Trump's wife, former first lady Melania Trump, also recently spoke out against allowing biological men in women's sports in her new memoir "Melania," despite admittedly disagreeing with most Republican principles on LGBT rights.

Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration has taken sweeping actions to enable transgender inclusion.

In April, the administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on "sex" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and "pregnancy or related conditions."

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person’s gender identity. The Biden administration insisted that the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims that it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports were not true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states.
EXCLUSIVE: NASCAR star Bubba Wallace was once accused of bringing politics into NASCAR. But in this year's election, he won't go near it.

In July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the aftermath of the George Floyd riots, Wallace made multiple posts on X (then known as Twitter) condemning former President Donald Trump for promoting hate. Trump himself attacked Wallace on social media over the driver calling for a ban on confederate flags at races, and alleged that an investigation into noose being found in his garage was a "hoax." An FBI investigation found that the noose had been in the garage stall since October 2019, and no crime had been committed.

Later that year, Wallace alleged that he'd been told he was "bringing politics into NASCAR," in response to his condemnation for Trump. But Wallace hasn't made any such posts at all regarding the 2024 election, or any political subject of such a matter via public statements.

"Investing my time into that seems like a waste of time," Wallace told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. "I was definitely more vocal then because our sport was in desperate need of change."

Now in 2024, Wallace only has one message to send to his fans about the beliefs he wants to share with them.

"Go to McDonald's," Wallace said when asked by Fox News Digital what beliefs he would like to express to his fans in this election year. "Buy a meal, get the 10-piece chicken nugget, fries, Dr. Pepper and then round up that money, all of that money goes to [Ronald McDonald House Charities]."

For Wallace, the sudden shift in priorities comes after four years as an ascendant star in NASCAR. But also milestone moments for him in building a family. In 2021 he joined Michael Jordan's NASCAR team, serving as the first driver in the car to sport Jordan's famous No. 23. In 2022, Wallace tied his own record as the highest-finishing Black driver in the Dayton 500.

In that time, he also got engaged and married to his wife, Amanda Carter. And they just had their first child, a son named Becks Hayden Wallace on Sept. 29.

He admitted his priorities have changed, and credited becoming a father for it. He also claims that he is now looking beyond "which side" someone is on.

"My beliefs stand strong in just being good humans to other people is the best way to go about life. No matter what side you're on, no matter what color you are, at the end of the day we're in this world together and we have to make it work together. And I think I've said that from day one and that hasn't changed and nor will it change."

Wallace has abandoned the act of making his political beliefs known on social media. He even went as far as to delete all social media apps on his phone altogether. His feed on X nowadays is just a curated mix of racing photos, promotional posts and photos of family.

One of the biggest reasons Wallace abandoned that habit from 2020 is because of culture shifts in social media during that time. Wallace said there is overwhelming "negativity" on the platforms he would use to get any messages of his beliefs out.

NASCAR ICON RICHARD CHILDRESS DESCRIBES ‘GREAT’ RECEPTION FOR JD VANCE APPEARANCE AT NORTH CAROLINA RACE

"Social media nowadays is just a way for people to hide behind a screen and voice their opinions on things they don't really know about," Wallace said.

The main social media platform that Wallace used during his 2020 criticisms against Trump was Twitter. In the four years since then, the platform has undergone a transformation under the ownership of tech mogul Elon Musk. Musk's purchasing of the platform in October 2022 brought about sweeping staff turnover, a complete restructuring of how the platform verifies accounts, and the rebrand to X, among other changes. Some have called the sweeping changes a renaissance for free speech. But others have criticized Musk and the changes, including Democrat lawmakers.

Rep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), requesting an investigation into election-related misinformation being published by the Grok AI chatbot on X. California governor Gavin Newsome signed the country’s toughest law banning digitally altered political "deepfakes" on Sept. 17, after Musk for shared an AI-generated parody video mocking Kamala Harris' candidacy for president.

Meanwhile, another social media platform has had an active hand in pushing leftist misinformation since 2020 as well. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted in August that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to "censor" some COVID-19 content during the pandemic and vowed that the social media giant would push back if it faced such demands again.

And as a result, Wallace doesn't believe the platforms are worth his time anymore, especially now that he's a dad.

"It's just too much negativity that it's going to take years and years and years to get rid of, and we don't have time for that," Wallace said of the current culture of social media. "Now, with being a dad and trying to be the best that I can be here for my race team and my team here, that's where I'm investing my energy so that's all you can really ask for."

For Wallace, the impact of becoming a father has been a transformative experience for him in such a short amount of time. Since his son was born, Wallace has two-top ten finishes in the three races that he's competed in. He's also looking at life through a lense he wasn't looking through before.

"You have your kid at home and a full family to provide for now, so it's crazy to go through all that," Wallace said.

Former President Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest 50%-48%, according to a new Fox News national survey. That’s a reversal from last month, when Harris had a narrow advantage.

Harris, however, is ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key battleground states (within the margin of error for that subsample), and the candidates are tied at 49% each among voters in close counties (where the Biden-Trump 2020 margin was less than 10 points). Trump’s advantage comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020 (64%-35%) than Harris has in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58%-39%).

That raises the question of whether the Democrat could win the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, it was the GOP candidate who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.

Trump’s 2-point edge among likely voters falls well within the margin of error. The results are identical among the larger group of registered voters. Last month, Harris was up by 2 points (50%-48%) among both likely and registered voters.

WALZ SILENT ON SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING ELECTORAL COLLEGE AFTER HARRIS CAMP SAYS IT DOESN'T BACK BAN

This analysis uses registered voter results for apples-to-apples trend comparisons.

These are Trump’s best numbers since Harris became the nominee in August. The movement toward him mainly comes from an increase in support among White voters, who now favor him by 10 points, up from 4 points last month and 6 points in August. He is also at record highs among voters 65 and over (49%) and those with a college degree (48%).

At the same time, Harris receives her lowest support since becoming the nominee among Black voters (67%), college graduates (49%), voters 65 and over (47%) and Whites with a college degree (46%).

TRIO OF NEW POLLS AGREE ON WHERE TRUMP AND HARRIS STAND WITH 3 WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY

Yet on the surface, the race has stayed within a small range. In August, Trump was ahead by 1 point, then Harris was up by 2 points in September, and now Trump has a 2-point edge.

"Overall, the movement toward Trump is subtle but potentially consequential, especially if he is making gains among college-educated voters," says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. "However, the race has been well within the margin of error for three months and the outcome will likely hinge on which side is more effective at getting their voters to the polls as opposed to persuasion."

The 20-point gender gap remains, as men back Trump and women go for Harris.

The good news for Harris is she gets 52% of new voters (those who haven’t voted in the last two presidential elections) and 20% of non-MAGA Republicans.

She is also maintaining her double-digit lead over Trump among independents. That keeps the contest close, as each candidate receives backing from over 9 in 10 of their respective partisans. On the other hand, more voters nationally identify as Republican than Democrat, and that is what gives Trump the edge in this race.

While the vice president gets majority support among Hispanics (52%) and voters under age 30 (54%), both numbers trail President Biden’s support in 2020, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis election survey (6 in 10 from each group).

For Trump, the good news is that he has improved on every issue and character trait since September. And a majority remember his time in office positively: 53% approve of the job he did as president. That is 4 points higher than he ever received while in office. Fully 93% of Republicans approve, as do 74% of non-MAGA Republicans and 45% of independents.

HARRIS RAMPS UP OUTREACH TO BLACK MALE VOTERS AS POLLS SUGGEST TRUMP MAKING GAINS

By comparison, currently only 40% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, which matches previous lows in November 2023 and July 2022.

Only slightly more, 43%, approve of the government’s response to recent hurricanes, with most Democrats approving and most Republicans and independents disapproving.

The economy continues to outrank all other issues, as 40% say it is the most important issue in deciding their choice for president. Less than half as many prioritize immigration and abortion, and far fewer cite issues such as election integrity, health care, climate change, guns, crime and foreign policy.

Seven in 10 view the economy negatively. The 30% who rate conditions positively is up from a low of 17% in 2022, and close to the 33% who felt good about the economy at the end of Trump’s term. Half of Democrats give positive ratings, while majorities of Republicans and independents rate economic conditions negatively.

Overall, 44% say they are falling behind financially, which is worse by 17 points compared to three years ago, when only 27% felt that way. Some 13% feel they are getting ahead financially, while 43% are holding steady.

Trump is seen as better than Harris at handling the economy (by 8 points). He also bests her on immigration (+15), crime (+8) and guns (+6). With the expanding conflict in the Middle East, it is noteworthy that Trump is favored by 13 points on Israel and the war, up from a 7-point lead in September. He has improved his standing on every issue compared to September, mostly by small margins.

More voters trust Harris to handle abortion (by 14 points), climate change (+12), and health care (+8). The two candidates are rated about evenly on taxes (Trump +4), Supreme Court nominations (Trump +1) and election integrity (Harris +3).

"Sometimes, elections are simple," says Shaw. "In three weeks, we may be wondering how we thought the sitting vice president would win when only two in five voters think the incumbent administration has done a good job and only one in seven say they are getting ahead financially."

Democrats and Republicans prioritize the issues differently, with the widest gap (28 points) on immigration. There’s an 18-point gap on abortion and 15 points on the economy.

Some 12% of Democrats see Trump as better at handling the economy and 18% feel that way about immigration, while 17% of Republicans trust Harris more on abortion and climate change.

NEW POLL SHOWS HARRIS, TRUMP SPLITTING 2 KEY STATES

Trump is helped by more voters saying they know a great deal about where he stands on their priority issues than they do about Harris (57% vs. 44%). Fully 78% of Republicans feel they know a great deal about Trump’s stances, while 65% of Democrats say the same about Harris.

Less than half believe Trump (43%) and Harris (48%) are honest and trustworthy, though Trump’s number is a personal best. Voters are also more likely to see him as a strong leader (55% vs. 47% for Harris) and "up to the job" of president (53% vs. 50%). Harris has an edge in having the mental soundness to be president (54% vs. 52% for Trump), but here again Trump is at a personal best.

Harris has lost ground on some key characteristics. She was seen as better at helping the middle class by 9 points in September, and that has declined to 4 points now. Her 5-point edge on "fighting for people like you" is now 2 points, and her 6-point advantage on "protecting personal rights and freedoms" has disappeared as the candidates are tied.

Voters also narrowly see Trump as the one bringing needed change and protecting free speech, both traits where Harris was favored last month.

The race continues to be more about Trump than Harris, as most of his backers say their vote is for him rather than against Harris. Among Harris supporters, two-thirds describe their vote as for her, but one-third say it is against Trump. For comparison, in May, nearly half of Biden supporters said their vote was mainly against Trump. Among Trump supporters, 80% say they are voting for him rather than against Harris (18%).

When saying in their own words what one issue or factor was motivating them to get out and vote this year, the top response from Harris supporters is dislike of the other candidate, followed by protecting democracy and abortion. For those backing Trump, the economy and immigration are the top two motivators, followed by candidate characteristics. Among men, it’s dislike of the other candidate, the economy and traits (in that order), while for women, the economy and abortion tie as the top motivator, followed by candidate traits.

Poll-Pourri

— As red and blue states become shades of purple, it is tough to know what level of a popular vote suggests a win in the Electoral College. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got more votes nationally by a 2-point margin, but lost the Electoral College (by 77 electoral votes), while Biden had a 4-point advantage in the popular vote and won the Electoral College (by 74).

— About one-third of voters overall and one-third of women say Harris becoming the first female president matters to their vote. Among the 17% saying it matters a great deal, 80% back Harris.

— About 3 in 10 voters say they check the news multiple times a day, and they favor Trump by 10 points. At the other end of the spectrum, 1 in 10 say they don’t pay attention to the news, and these disengaged voters favor Trump by 16 points. The 57% who follow the news regularly but not constantly back Harris by 6 points.

— Most of each candidate’s backers feel certain of their vote, and two-thirds of both Harris and Trump’s supporters say they are "extremely" motivated to vote.

Conducted Oct. 11-14 under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,110 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (129) and cellphones (719) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (262). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 870 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with results among subgroup is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Likely voters are based on a probabilistic statistical model that relies on past voting history, interest in the current election, age, education, race, ethnicity, church attendance and marital status.

Democrats have threatened to use the powers of Congress to keep Donald Trump out of the White House if he wins the 2024 election — but is it even possible?

“MoneyGPT” author James Rickards believes it is.

“Let’s just say Trump wins. Now, that’s not a sure thing. It’s going to be a close election, but my models show Trump winning. So he gets more than 270 electoral votes, so we come up to December 17, when they actually count those votes in state capitals. And there are going to be disputes and litigation,” Rickards tells Glenn Beck of “The Glenn Beck Program.”

“But let’s say we make it. I’m just kind of looking ahead as far as we can, to January 6, 2025. Everyone’s spun up about January 6, 2021. We know what happened, but this is January 6, 2025. Those electoral votes go to the House and the Senate,” he explains.

This is the reason that Trump’s campaigning in states like New York and California, despite knowing he won’t win the states in the election.

“They’re fighting over House seats, because if the Democrats take a majority of the House of Representatives, which is possible,” he continues, “they’re going to pass a resolution saying that Trump is an insurrectionist under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.”

“So now you pass this resolution, what happens? Trump’s votes would be disqualified. Let’s say he has 300 electoral votes, and, you know, pick a number over 270. Those are disqualified on the grounds that he’s an insurrectionist,” Rickards says.

If this were to happen, the election would go to the House of Representatives.

“The House votes to choose the president, but there are a couple of caveats. One is they can only vote for someone who got in the top three electoral votes,” he explains. “If you disqualify Trump, no one else is going to win a state, and Kamala Harris is the only one you could vote for, because top three, but she would be the top one.”

The race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is tightening in the final stretches, so there’s a question Americans must ask themselves: Should Trump eke out a victory, will Democrats be able to mentally handle it?

The short answer is probably not, and prominent Democrats only have themselves to blame for continuing to spread unhinged propaganda about Trump’s plot to end American democracy and enslave women, even in the wake of two assassination attempts on the former president. Harris stoked the kind of irrational fear that could set off a full-blown mental health crisis among her constituents in a telling exchange during her town hall Tuesday with host Charlamagne Tha God.

A caller during Charlamagne tha God’s town-hall worries that Trump will put “anyone who doesn’t look white into camps.” Harris replies, “you’ve hit on a really important point and expressed it I think so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect–to make you scared.” — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) October 15, 2024

A caller told the show he was worried Trump would put people of color into gulag-style camps if he wins in November.

“Hi, I’m Bobby from Georgia, and I have a question for Kamala Harris,” the caller began. “Could you please respond to Trump’s claim that he’s going to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to round up immigrants if he wins the election? This law was last used to put Asian Americans in internment camps during World War II, and I have a sneaking suspicion that if Trump wins, he’s going to use this law to put anyone that doesn’t look white in camps, and I’m scared.”

“You’ve hit on a really important point and expressed it, I think, so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect — to make you scared,” Harris replied in a moment of sheer projection. “He is running full-time on a campaign that is about instilling fear. Not about hope, not about optimism, not about the future, but about fear, and so this is yet another example.”

Rather than showing a modicum of integrity and honesty in a moment that was all but crying out for it, Harris told this presumably low-information voter that yes, his fears about being tossed into a gulag because he isn’t white are valid. Never mind that Trump plans to deport illegal immigrants who broke the law: You, Bobby, are on the verge of a decade of hard labor in a federal prison camp erected in some God-forsaken part of the United States, all because you are not white.

Let’s assume that at least a third of all Democrats are as untethered from reality as Bobby from Georgia. We’re looking at tens of millions of Americans who are going to wake up the morning after Election Day harboring fears that the Trump Administration’s Gestapo is going to barge through their door, drag them out into an unmarked van and disappear them for life.

Now, let’s look at how a supposedly smart, urbane, informed liberal elite, someone like Bill Maher, is reacting to a potential second Trump presidency (even though Maher himself doesn’t think Trump will win).

“He’s insane, so he could start sending people to Guantanamo Bay. I don’t put anything past this guy,” he said. “He thinks they’re eating the cats and the dogs, but am I going to worry about it? First of all, I’m not going to worry about it, Phil, because he’s not going to win,” Maher recently told Dr. Phil.

Bill Maher, Mr. Rational Centrist, is talking about Trump shipping off Americans to Guantanamo Bay as if he’s some right-wing dictator? Uh-oh.

If these sorts of deluded fantasies are any indicator of how the left will handle a Trump win, Democrats are barreling toward a mental health boondoggle post-Election Day. What do you think will happen to all those Millennial and Gen Z women — many of whom were already struggling with anxiety, depression and substance abuse — who were programmed for a year that Trump will crush their human rights if he reclaims power in the White House? Nothing good, I will tell you that.

It might be wise and prudent for top elected officials, in both parties, to dial down the fear porn just a little bit so that their fellow Americans don’t suffer a mass, stress-induced aneurysm when their preferred candidate loses. Maybe then the country will be able to crawl out of this toxic sludge of conspiracy and paranoia and have a productive, civic discussion.
No other Democrat the party could have nominated this year better exemplifies the left’s obsession with identity politics than Vice President Kamala Harris. Woke but not poor, black but not oppressed, and pissed off when talking about her uterus, no Democrat who ran in 2019 is more emblematic of a character shaped by the far-left hysterics around “social justice.” So naturally, Harris would embrace the kind of moral bankruptcy she projects onto her opponents in discussions on race.

On Tuesday, Harris continued to embrace her boss’s exploitation of racial grievances for ballots by claiming Republicans want to enslave all black people.

In 2012, then-Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd of African Americans that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney wanted to “put you all back in chains.”

On black podcaster Charlamagne tha God’s audio town hall Tuesday night, Harris agreed with a caller who fretted former President Donald Trump will lock “anyone who doesn’t look white into camps.”

The vice president’s response was no John McCain 2008. Instead, she said, “You’ve hit on a really important point and expressed it I think so well.”

Harris went on to feed fear that Trump might throw black people back in chains like her Democrat predecessor did to win the 2012 election. The vice president used Trump’s activism on behalf of an Ohio town overwhelmed by Haitian immigrants as evidence of his supposed Hitler-style solution.

“This is yet another example,” she said. “Look what he did in saying that those legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their pets.”

Harris was referencing Trump’s comments about the more than 20,000 Haitians now living in the central Ohio blue-collar town.

“They’re eating the dogs!” Trump said on the presidential debate stage last month. “They’re eating the cats … They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”

The Federalist had just exclusively published an August phone call to Springfield an hour before the debate in which a man said he witnessed four Haitians each carrying a dead goose.

“I was trying to get my phone out and I was trying to make it to this orientation on time,” the caller said. (Audio of the call can be found here.) “I’m time crunching here, and I saw that, I’m like, ‘Yeah this has got to be reported.'”

The Haitians with the geese were apparently gone by the time police arrived, but the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) confirmed days after the Trump-Harris forum that a second call to authorities was placed in March.

“The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife has a dedicated wildlife officer assigned to Clark County who routinely monitors Snyder Park in Springfield because it is a popular fishing area,” a statement from the agency said. “That Wildlife Officer received calls on two separate occasions from people who reported witnessing individuals of Haitian descent taking waterfowl out of Snyder Park.”

Trump has never said anything about enslaving black people, but that hasn’t stopped Democrats from peddling fear about the former president plotting genocide even following two assassination attempts.
Five states join the rest of the country on Wednesday as they start the early voting process for the 2024 election.

Iowa, Kansas, Nevada, Oregon and Rhode Island make a total of 49 states and Washington, D.C., that have begun early voting.

Here's how to cast a ballot in each state.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

Nevada is one of the most competitive states this cycle

Forever a battleground, reliably Democrat: That’s the story of Nevada’s presidential politics.

The state has voted for every Democrat who has run for president since 1992, except the two elections with President Bush on the ballot. But the average margin across those eight elections is just 4.1 points.

There are only six electoral votes at stake, but they could be crucial for either candidate. If Harris wins two of the battleground Rust Belt states but loses Pennsylvania, for example, then a combination of Nevada and North Carolina would make up for the deficit.

Nevada is home to the "Reid Machine," a voter turnout operation named after late Senate leader Harry Reid, that activates voters favorable to Democrats, especially Hispanic and unionized hospitality workers in the Las Vegas area.

Those groups aren’t as overwhelmingly Democrat as they used to be. The party has shed 10 points worth of the Hispanic vote since 2020 and seven points of the non-college-educated vote.

Voters backed a Republican for governor in 2022; that election came two years after the COVID-19 pandemic decimated the tourism industry. They held on to their Democrat senator.

Republicans do well in the vast rural areas led by Lincoln County, where Trump won by 71 points in 2020, and the state’s northeastern counties.

The battleground is Washoe County, home to Reno. Biden won there by 4.5 points in 2020, making it the state’s closest county.

Nevada is a Toss Up in the Fox News Power Rankings.

The Silver State also has a senate race on the ballot. Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen seeks a second term in office but faces Republican Army veteran Sam Brown. The Senate race is ranked Lean D.

Finally, Iowa voters start heading to the polls today. Once a hotly competitive state, it voted for Trump by eight points in 2020. Iowa is one of several states dominated by White working-class voters who flipped to Trump in his first run for office and have not gone back.

A recent Des Moines Register survey showing Harris four points behind Trump raised eyebrows, but it would take an extraordinary night for Harris to flip this one.

Key downballot races in today’s early voting states

Voting also begins today in four battleground House districts. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

Iowa’s 1st District : Second-term GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks won this seat by six votes in 2020, and while redistricting gave her a more comfortable win in the midterms, she remains vulnerable in the Davenport and Iowa City district. Former state Rep. Christina Bohannan is the Democrat candidate. It’s a Toss Up in the Power Rankings.

Zach Nunn, who flipped the seat during the midterms. It was another close race, with 2,145 votes separating him and his Democrat opponent. This year, he’s up against Democrat Lanon Baccam, who recently worked at the USDA. This is a Lean R race.

The Democrat challenger this time around is state Rep. Janelle Bynum. It’s another Power Rankings Toss Up.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton can continue investigating allegations of so-called vote harvesting through the November elections, a U.S. appeals court said Tuesday, a decision critics fear could have a chilling effect on voter outreach and turnout in the state.

The three-judge appellate court for the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court on Tuesday granted a temporary stay for certain portions of S.B. 1, or the 2021 Texas voting law, including a provision of the law that allows Paxton's office to continue its investigations into alleged illegal "vote harvesting" efforts at least through the Nov. 5 elections.

The stay will remain in place until a full appeal of the law is either granted or denied, according to the appellate decision.

Their decision temporarily overturns the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez late last month. Rodriguez ordered an immediate halt to the vote harvesting provision of S.B. 1, siding with plaintiffs in their contention that the provision is overly vague and a restriction of free speech.

He also acknowledged their "widespread confusion" as to what constitutes the illegal practice of vote harvesting in Texas.

TED CRUZ WARNS TEXAS SENATE RACE IS ‘INCREDIBLY CLOSE’

Paxton had immediately vowed to appeal that decision, arguing that the vote harvesting component of S.B. 1 is crucial to protecting election integrity in Texas and preventing voter fraud.

"Blocking our ability to investigate certain election crimes would have been a serious disruption to the electoral landscape with only a month left before Election Day," Paxton said at the time.

Still, the vaguely-defined scope of vote harvesting has prompted some advocacy groups and voter outreach groups in Texas to halt their canvassing, volunteering and other in-person election events altogether, citing fears of being swept up in a raid, or providing volunteers with food or transportation that could potentially be perceived as "compensation," which is illegal under the law.

In writing for the three-judge appellate court on Tuesday, Judge James Ho appeared to back Paxton's contention, noting that the provision in question had been on the books for "over three years" before the federal judge's decision last month.

Still, plaintiffs in the lawsuit say their confusion remains over the vaguely worded definition of vote harvesting, which in turn they say has had a chilling effect on volunteer efforts in the state.

That is, in part, due to the steep punishment for individuals convicted of the crime, which is classified under S.B. 1 as a third-degree felony.

BIDENS ON THE TRAIL: PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY CAMPAIGN IN THE BIGGEST OF THE BATTLEGROUNDS

Individuals who give, offer, or receive some "compensation or other benefit" for so-called vote harvesting services can be convicted of the third-degree felony, S.B. 1 states, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.

"Vote harvesting services" include any "in-person interaction with one or more voters, in the physical presence of an official ballot or a ballot voted by mail, intended to deliver votes for a specific candidate or measure," according to the law's text.

Paxton’s office has said previously that " secure elections are the cornerstone of our republic."

In August, his office's Election Integrity Unit executed searches in three South Texas counties as part of the ongoing probe, which it says was conducted only after officials gathered enough evidence to obtain proper search warrants.

Plaintiffs, however, allege that his office has used the provision to carry out illegal "voter raids" against advocacy groups and organizers in Texas.

Juan Proaño, the CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, lamented the ruling, telling Fox News in an interview Tuesday his group would appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.

"It's really frightening to our community," Proaño told Fox News of S.B. 1, noting the provisions have already had a "significant" chilling effect on voters and advocacy groups in Texas – which they have argued are both unjustified and used as a potential means of voter suppression.

"There's no data at all that actually would show that non-citizens are participating in the election process," he said, adding that LULAC "stands for election integrity."

"And so we will continue to litigate that all the way up to the Supreme Court, if we have to."
The Senate Democrat campaign arm announced a new effort to reach Black voters on Wednesday as Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the ticket, is struggling to match President Biden's margin with the demographic.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is advertising in local Black media outlets across seven states with pivotal Senate races, including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Maryland, Texas and Florida.

The ads will focus on emphasizing the importance of participating in the upcoming elections, as fears of declining enthusiasm among Black voters are returning.

'A LOT OF TRUMP SIGNS': RESIDENTS IN BLUE STRONGHOLD MILWAUKEE BREAK DOWN 2024 ELECTION

"Our vote. Our power. Make your voice heard, make your plan to vote. IWillVote.com," the ad said.

It is running, starting on Wednesday, in publications such as the Florida Star, the Baltimore Times/Annapolis Times, the Michigan Chronicle, the Call & Post in Ohio, the West Philly Journal, Houston Style Magazine, Dallas Weekly and the Milwaukee Community Journal.

"Black voters have the power to shape the outcome of the 2024 election and will play a critical role in defending Democrats’ Senate majority that is fighting for the values, priorities and issues that matter most for Black Americans. This campaign will build on Senate Democrats’ efforts to meet Black voters wherever they are and ensure that every voter has the information they need to make their plan to vote and make their voice heard in the 2024 Senate election," DSCC Deputy Executive Director Jessica Knight Henry said in a statement.

The Democrats' effort to shore up Black voter turnout and support in crucial Senate races comes as recent polling indicates former President Donald Trump is making gains with Black men, who are traditionally some of the Democratic Party's most reliable supporters.

'I WAS MUCH BETTER OFF': THESE VOTERS BACK TRUMP IN TOP BATTLEGROUND COUNTY

It also comes as Harris' campaign faces a disparity between Biden's 2020 vote share of the demographic and hers.

In a recent poll, 76% of Black voters said they would support Harris if the election were held that day, per the New York Times and Siena College. While over three-quarters of the group indicated they would back Harris, the number was shy of the 90% of Black voters who chose Biden in 2020, when the president defeated then-President Trump.

Amid this concern, Harris' campaign unveiled this week its "Opportunity Agenda for Black Men."

Her plan includes fully forgivable loans for Black entrepreneurs, a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and legalizing recreational marijuana, among other measures.

KAMALA HARRIS ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING IN 2009 BOOK ABOUT BEING 'SMART ON CRIME'

"Kamala Harris and Senate Democrats are struggling with Black voters because Black voters don’t like paying insanely high prices at the grocery store, mass illegal immigration, and having their taxpayer funds used to pay for gender transition surgery for murderers," National Republican Senate Committee Communications Director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Top Democrat Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., recently admitted his concern about Black voters supporting Republicans, saying on CNN's "State of the Union," "I am concerned about Black men staying home or voting for Trump."

Former President Barack Obama also expressed worry in Pennsylvania, telling people at a pre-campaign stop, "I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that."

Harris answered questions about her support with Black men in a recent interview, explaining, "One, that's not my experience," and, "Two, Election Day has not arrived yet."

"Black men are no different from anybody else," she said on the Black-focused entertainment show "The Shade Room."

"They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here."

Harris also did an audio town hall this week on iHeartRadio with "Breakfast Club" radio show co-host Charlamagne Tha God, who is particularly popular with Black listeners.

Michelle Obama will headline an Atlanta rally on October 29 for the Kamala Harris campaign after she initially had no plans to help the coronated Democrat nominee.

The announcement, first reported in the Associated Press, suggests the Harris campaign is becoming more desperate to prevent former President Donald Trump from completing the greatest comeback in modern American politics.

The rally to boost turnout will occur on November 1, five days before election day, just before early voting ends in Georgia. The AP reported on Michelle Obama’s decision to enter the 2024 fray: The Oct. 29 event will be hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement group that Obama founded in 2018 to “change the culture around voting” and reach out to people who are less likely to engage in politics and elections. The rally is likely to help the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, in a closely contested state. Obama is one of the party’s best-known figures and gave a speech boosting Harris’ candidacy at the national convention in August. It is unclear which celebrities will attend the rally but organizers noted that the group’s co-chairs include professional basketball players Stephen Curry and Chris Paul; musical artists Becky G, H.E.R., Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Monáe; beauty influencer Bretman Rock; and actors Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington. Multiple polls show Vice President Kamala Harris performing poorly in some battleground states, and it appears the campaign has become more desperate in the past week. The campaign announced Monday that its candidate would appear Wednesday in an interview on Fox News, which critics say reeks of desperation.

Polling shows Harris is losing support among men, black voters, and Hispanic voters, while Trump is running ahead of his 2020 and 2016 performances. Swing state polling indicates Trump is either leading Harris or within the margin of error. Voter registrations and early voting also appear to benefit Trump in many states.
Vice President Kamala Harris is losing independent voters, likely because she can’t stop pandering on issues most voters rank lower on their priority list.

The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows that former President Donald has gained support among independent voters from September compared to Harris. “A slight change is among independents … Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.” the poll shows.

It’s no surprise by now that former President Donald Trump is polling well on critical issues, like the economy and illegal immigration. Voters see him as the candidate who will do more for Americans struggling to afford daily life and end the open border policies championed during the Biden-Harris administration.

Meanwhile, most Americans believe Harris will protect abortion rights, but not much else. And for good reason, everything she does seems to come back to the abortion issue.

While Americans were struggling to survive Hurricane Helene’s devastating effects, Harris opted to sit with Call Her Daddy podcast host Alex Cooper to talk about so-called “female reproductive rights.” The two women spent the almost 45-minute episode talking about protecting women’s right to an abortion, leaving only a couple of minutes on issues like the economy. (WATCH: New Daily Caller Documentary ‘Selling Sex’)

Similarly, in an ad pandering for the male vote (which went viral because of how badly it missed the mark portraying actual masculinity), the men declared, “I am man enough,” while claiming that real men weren’t scared of protecting abortion. It’s like her campaign can’t help but squeeze the topic into everything they talk about as if they genuinely believe her view on abortion rights will win her the election.

The ABC News poll also found that Harris trails Trump by eight points in who voters trust more to handle the economy and seven points on tackling inflation. Regime media seem confused about why Harris is having a tough time breaking free from the disastrous economic stewardship of the Biden-Harris administration. But it doesn’t take a high IQ to realize that if your campaign’s primary focus is promising to allow Americans to kill their legacy instead of giving them solutions on how to afford one financially, the voters aren’t going to see you as a change agent.

Popular X user @bitcoin4freedom announced he was voting for Trump in 2024 because he’d make America safe, healthy and prosperous. While he said that he “can’t stand Donald Trump,” he believes Harris sees the country as “inherently evil.” (ROOKE: Republicans Are Winning A War The Left Started)

“Every time she talks, I try to give her a chance. But she is the most phony and condescending politician I have ever seen. Ever. I can’t do it. I won’t do it,” he said.

“The people who want Kamala Harris to win are the most annoying people in the country. They have pushed for pronouns, masks, endless vaccines, cancel culture, riots, blatant racism towards whites, gender confusion, undermining the U.S. constitution,” he added.

I can’t stand Donald Trump. He is braggy, he insults people for no reason, and he is just a brutal personality. But my mind is made up. I’m voting for him and here’s why: * He puts Americans and their well-being first. Kamala will not. * He will bring @elonmusk into his… — Jason (@Bitcoin4Freedom) October 15, 2024

Her campaign’s priorities are turning otherwise independent or left-leaning voters off. While the majority of Americans (sadly) approve of abortion, better access to it does nothing to help them afford groceries, car payments or energy bills. Americans don’t have the luxury of voting on social issues in 2024. People are hurting, and Harris’ indifference to their pain makes her seem out-of-touch and callous.

Conversations with Harris are like:

Host: “Vice President, Americans can’t afford food. What are your plans to change that?”

Harris: “Well, as someone who grew up in a middle-class family, I believe abortion rights are fundamental in making sure we get where we need to be.”

QUESTION: What will you do to improve our healthcare system?

It would be funny if the economy weren’t crushing half the country. Instead of being a seasoned leader after her stint as President Joe Biden’s vice president, Harris comes off as a woman who would run the country like an HR department — devoid of productivity and always focusing on issues that hurt rather than help. (Polls Show Kamala’s Campaign Is Headed For Disaster, And The Media Knows It)

For this reason, her presidential campaign will likely fail to gain enough electoral college votes to get her into the White House. We see this in the historic decisions from national unions not to endorse her candidacy. In years past, heads of these unions lined up behind the Democrat candidate, but things are changing. She can’t sell competency or compassion when her main focus is ending Americans’ legacies.
If you’re a politician and want to appeal to young men, you shouldn’t spend years belittling them and then, in the eleventh hour, send a Marxist Mr. Magoo candidate on a pheasant hunt only for him to fumble around with a shotgun.

You also shouldn’t hire paid actors and a Jimmy Kimmel writer to whip up a cringe ad about how masculine men aren’t afraid to support a woman like Kamala Harris. But that’s exactly what the Harris-Walz campaign is doing in the final stretches of the race to court all the young men they’ve spent years alienating. They are attempting to repair a brand that has been Bud-Lighted. (RELATED: Democrats Bud Lighted Their Entire Brand, And It’s Too Late To Save It)

Trump, on the other hand, appears to be running a “Dudes Rock” campaign.

What is a Dudes Rock campaign, you might ask? A Dudes Rock campaign is going on a male-centric podcast, instead of a sex advice podcast like “Call Her Daddy,” and chopping it up with a couple dudes about football.

President Trump is NOT a fan of the new NFL kickoff rules.@BussinWTB pic.twitter.com/Nj9Td4kuF6 — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 15, 2024

It’s all the UFC appearances Trump has made in the past year. It’s inviting Elon Musk to a campaign rally. It’s the various podcast interviews with the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Logan Paul and Theo Von.

And it seems to be working. While Harris and Walz make flaccid, last-ditch efforts to win over men, mainly by doing and saying things that men will find fake and obnoxious, Trump is just being himself, on whatever platform is offered him, and building on his lead among young males between the ages of 18 and 29.

In late August, journalist Peter Hamby warned Bill Maher that a shift in young men toward Trump could blow up Kamala’s hopes of becoming the first female president.

“This is a real issue for Kamala Harris,” Hamby said. “This could be fatal for her campaign … Democrats need to win 60% of the youth vote to win the White House.”

“Hillary came up short; Obama did it; Biden did it. Kamala Harris is right now at, like, 55% of the youth vote,” he went on to say. “If she doesn’t get to 60, she could lose the election, and it’s because young men, Gen Z men, are breaking to Trump.”

This election might really come down to dudes who rock. We shall see.
Democratic Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell said Monday that voters in her state still don’t know Vice President Kamala Harris, with the election just under three weeks away.

Former President Donald Trump currently holds a slight lead over Harris in Michigan, edging her by nearly 1%, according to the RealClearPolling average. Dingell, on “America’s Newsroom,” said Harris and her running mate, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, “understand that they’ve got to better define themselves” in Michigan to defeat Trump and his running mate, Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, in November. (RELATED: CNN Panel ‘Surprised’ Kamala Harris Could Not Name Anything She’d Do Differently From Biden)

WATCH:

“I don’t think people know Kamala Harris yet. I do. I know how great she is. They need to feel her. We all know who Donald Trump is. I’m not going to use any adjectives I some moments would like to. But he is who he is. He’s passionate and he says what he thinks and people know him,” Dingell said. “They want to know that they know her. I think she’s trying to do that. She’s doing more media interviews, she’s doing different places.”

“I wish they would just let her go into the union hall, quite frankly. You’ve seen a lot of discussion identifying this a couple of months ago is young black men who, and it’s not her problem, it’s Democrats’ problems. And I’ve said this, it’s the way we didn’t talk about trade in 2016 in the right way,” she added. “They don’t want to be taken for granted. They feel taken for granted and they want to be talked to directly … What she’s doing in Detroit today is taking that on directly and a lot of other people are trying to go in.”

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten expressed surprise Monday at the degree to which “young black men” have increasingly been abandoning the Democratic Party over multiple elections against Trump.

Harris told “The View” on Oct. 8 that “nothing comes to mind” about how she would govern differently from President Joe Biden.

“I think she’s in a very difficult position because she was his vice president. And you know, I’m still old fashioned, I think loyalty does matter. But look, we’ve got to address the economy. She’s got to take that on, she’s got to talk about what she’s going to do,” Dingell said. “I think she’s got to talk about how she’s going to protect jobs and bring manufacturing back and lower the cost of food in the grocery store and she’s got to be very clear on having what she’s going to do. And now hopefully she’s going to be doing that in the next few days as well.

Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin warned Tuesday that she is “late in the game to be defining herself” and must “define her differences with Joe Biden.”

“This was a quick campaign, but you look at her schedule, more days than not, she’s got one event, zero events, a lot of staff meetings,” Halperin said. “And so if the goal is to define herself, then she’s letting other people do it for her more than she’s doing it herself, hour by hour.”

Trump also currently has narrow advantages over Harris in five of the other top seven battleground states, with the vice president only slightly leading the former president in Wisconsin, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin recently endorsed Donald Trump for president but with a caveat: Trump should be “heading toward a landslide” due to his opponent's failed policies and ineptitude, but the race remains tight because of Trump’s intemperate language. “His use of nasty, childish insults instead of arguments is part of an inexplicable pattern that turns off many voters,” Goodwin noted. “Day after day he calls opponents and critics dumb, stupid, lunatics, crazy, and idiots. Women are the most frequent targets.”

“If you were an undecided voter, especially a woman, would Trump calling Harris or Liz Cheney dumb or ‘stupid’ make you vote for him — or against him?”

For the Democrats and the left, Trump’s main problem is not his insulting language but his refusal to allow them to run things as they please.

I fully share Goodwin’s revulsion for some of the childish insults Trump throws at his opponents. Like Goodwin, I wish he would abandon this practice. I'll still vote for Trump, despite his speaking style, which annoys me as much as it does many critics. However, I also think this defect has little to do with why this election remains so close. More decisive factors are at play.

One, Democrats have a significantly larger war chest for this campaign, thanks to the generous backing of Hollywood moguls, corporate boards, and the Soros family, who are heavily financing Democratic candidates across the country. Republicans can't come close to matching these astronomical donations. Some previously secure Republican candidates, like Ted Cruz, have run out of campaign funds in their races. Cruz, for example, is struggling against his far-left opponent, Colin Allred. Allred, a congressman from Houston, has received $30 million in just three months, almost entirely from out-of-state Democratic donors.

Two, the corporate left-wing media overwhelmingly supports the Democrats. It's worked hard to defame Trump while promoting Kamala Harris’ hollow “politics of joy.” Over 90% of the information from these so-called purveyors of “facts” is biased toward the Democrats and the left. It hardly matters what the presidential candidates say or do; the media’s bias is evident in how it shapes the narrative for the public.

A large portion of the American electorate — roughly four in 10 — aligns with the left and is likely to vote for its candidates, regardless of how politely or impolitely competing candidates express their views. A Reuters poll shows that 41% of likely voters do not consider the illegal immigrants who have entered the country under the Biden-Harris administration to be a public threat.

What influences ideologically divided voters are the candidates’ positions on issues such as LGBT rights, Black Lives Matter, abortion, and asylum. Western countries have long displayed social and ideological divisions, and these splits have little to do with the tone of political rhetoric. American journalists, including Republican ones, tend to believe that “most of us are somewhere in the center.” While this may have been true during the Eisenhower era, there is little compelling evidence that it still holds today.

What proof exists that the impeccably polite JD Vance appeals to suburban women more than his outspoken running mate? Both candidates perform poorly with this group, unlike the culturally leftist, verbally stumbling Tim Walz, who attracts overwhelming support from progressive women. No evidence suggests that right-of-center candidates, whose speaking style Michael Goodwin and I appreciate and enjoy, would perform better than Trump among groups that reject his views.

Even more relevant, I don’t notice those who claim to be offended by Trump’s offensive language expressing the same revulsion for inflammatory language from the other side. Having spoken to gaggles of Harris voters, I haven’t heard any of them complain about how the Democratic Party and its media lackeys go after their Republican enemy.

Why is it that suburban women and chic professionals only hit the roof when Trump speaks but are not in the least offended by, say, Rep. Dan Goldman’s (D-N.Y.) call to “eliminate Trump”? In an effort to clean up Goldman’s enormity, Reuters assures us that it was spoken before the first assassination attempt on the former president. I’ve no idea how that makes Goldman’s statement less toxic or morally acceptable. Moreover, 28% of Democrats polled by Barron’s last month said that it would have been fine with them if Trump had been killed.

Even if Trump sounded like the mellifluous Vance or the well-ordered Ron DeSantis, that would not result in giving him a landslide. The growing political and cultural polarization in this country is unlikely to vanish even if Trump became a more tactful politician. For the Democrats and the left, Trump’s main problem is not his insulting language but his refusal to allow them to run things as they please. What is even worse for his enemies, this hated figure might win back the presidency in a few weeks.

Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday on a radio show hosted in Detroit that she has been clear about the need for reparations to be “studied,” noting she sees the “disparities” black Americans face.

Harris appeared on Charlamagne Tha God’s popular show, “The Breakfast Club,” to discuss her policy platform and take questions from residents of the key swing state. During the town hall-style interview, grassroots group founder Zeek Williams pressed Harris about her stance on reparations and how she plans to address issues affecting the black community.

“With all that black Americans have been through and contribute to the success of America, I feel that there should be an in depth investigation or evaluation of the lack of resources and current living conditions in black communities nationwide. My question to you is, what’s your stance on reparations?” Williams asked.

“We all know that America became great off the backs of free black labor. How progressive are you on making it a priority and righting America’s wrongs,” Williams continued. “It’s understood that you are running for president for all people of America, asking for specifics for black communities doesn’t mean don’t do for others, but black Americans are heavily asked to vote Democrat in every election for over half a century, with very little in return. What are your plans to address these very important issues and change that narrative?”

Harris’ campaign on Monday unveiled a new proposal to provide black men “with the tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights,” as polls show former President Donald Trump gaining within the once-Democratic strong voting bloc. In response to the Detroit local, Harris stated that while she is running for “all Americans,” she does have “clear eyes” on the issues facing black Americans. (RELATED: Fmr Clinton Pollster Says Dems Trying ‘Everything’ To Win Rural Voters Despite Being Beaten Badly By GOP With Group)

“So to your point, yes, I am running to be a president for all Americans. That being said, I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history to your point,” Harris said. “So my agenda, well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There’s no question about that. And I’ve been very clear about that position.”

WATCH:

Harris continued by outlining her proposals for black Americans, focusing on issues like housing, tax deductions, loans for black small businesses and health care for black men.

Despite Harris appearing to endorse reparations for descendants of slaves during her 2020 presidential run and time in the senate, her campaign has received backlash for its lack of details on Harris’ stance over the issue since she became the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. Recent polls show the vice president slipping among black voters, especially black men, prompting her campaign to adopt new tactics.

The Harris campaign held a rally in Pennsylvania on Oct. 10, with former President Barack Obama urging black men to support the Democratic candidate. Before speaking, Obama warned supporters backstage that Harris was trailing in “turnout” numbers compared to his campaigns, particularly within the black community.

Recent data from the Howard University Initiative on Public Opinion shows that Trump’s support among black men has surged to 16%, with an additional September NAACP poll finding that more than one-quarter of young black men, among 1,000 registered black voters surveyed, said they would support Trump over Harris.

Michigan’s polling data average from RealClearPolling currently shows Trump leading by one point, as he holds 48.4% support leaving Harris with 47.4%.

Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait was booed Tuesday during his interview with former President Donald Trump after pressing him on the Jan. 6 riots, stating the 2020 transfer of power was the “worst” in recent memory.

In early May, corporate media repeatedly pressed Republicans on whether they would certify the election if Trump lost, citing the Jan. 6 riots and blaming Trump for the event. During the interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, Micklethwait described Jan. 6 as a display of America’s democracy being “unruly and violent,” and asked Trump if he would “commit now” to “respecting and encouraging a peaceful transfer of power.”

“Well, you had a peaceful transfer of power,” Trump responded.

“You had a peaceful transfer of power? You had a peaceful — Come on, President Trump,” Micklethwait pushed back as the crowd could be heard cheering for Trump’s response. “You had a peaceful transfer of power compared with Venezuela, but it was by far … the worst transfer of power for a long time.”

Trump then turned to the audience and thanked them for their support before Micklethwait asked if he would “respect the decision” if he lost to Vice President Kamala Harris. (RELATED: Some Dems Won’t Commit To Certifying Election Results If Trump Wins)

“When I found out about this interview, I did a little check. This is a man that has not been a big Trump fan over the years, so I had a choice,” Trump said. “Do I do this interview or not? I’m glad I did it, but do I do this interview or do I disappoint a lot of people? Because I know a lot of people in the audience, but his view is very different than mine.”

WATCH:

“We had a term peacefully and patriotically. These were people. If you think an election is crooked, and I do 100%. If you think — the day it comes when you can’t protest, you take a look at the Democrats. They protested 2016, they’re still protesting, and nobody talks about them. But if we protest, we want to have honest elections. You think the last election was honest?” Trump asked.

In early June Congress unveiled provided footage from HBO, showing former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stating on camera that she took “responsibility for not having them just prepare for more.” Both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly failed to take action despite having knowledge prior to the event that suggested the day would unfold in chaos and violence, according to a 2023 senate report.

Micklethwait pointed out to Trump that courts had dismissed cases challenging the 2020 election. While Trump acknowledged the comment, he emphasized that the “facts” didn’t align with judges’ rulings, which cited a lack of standing.

“I left the morning that I was supposed to leave. I went to Florida, and you had a very peaceful transfer. This was not a — and I’ll tell you what those people that did go dead, which was a tiny fraction of the people that went to Washington,” Trump continued. “I mean, you’re talking about a very, very small — because [there were] hundreds of 1000s of people, and I don’t know what you had 5, 6, 7, hundred people go down to the Capitol.”

“But those people that was not, that was — not one of those people had a gun. Nobody was killed, except for Ashley Babbitt. She was killed,” Trump said.

Ryan Busse is running for governor of Montana, a major coal state, as a Democrat after two of his children sued the state over climate change and emissions, E&E News reported Tuesday.

Busse’s two teenage sons were plaintiffs in Held v. Montana, in which a group of Montana youths sued the state on the grounds that prioritizing fossil fuel development violates their rights by contributing to climate change, according to E&E News. Busse, a former executive in the gun industry, has not played up the lawsuit on the campaign trail in his race against incumbent Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who appears to hold a sizable lead in the race with a few weeks to go until Election Day.

While a Montana judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in the youth climate case in August 2023, critics have derided the ruling as “absurd” and a political stunt rather than an earnest decision grounded in statute, according to the Montana Free Press. The Sierra Club, a major environmental activist group, celebrated the ruling as a major victory, in part because it “[sets] a precedent for further lawsuits” against disfavored energy production and policies.

Montana is the sixth largest coal-producing state and sits atop of the largest estimated recoverable coal reserves of any state in the country, according to the Energy Information Administration. Busse has heard from voters concerned about the kids’ climate case given the energy industry’s economic importance to the state, and Busse reportedly has not touted the lawsuit while campaigning despite his strong views on climate change and its causes.

“The idea that we stick our heads in the sand and don’t consider carbon dioxide as a pollutant is foolhardy and anti-science,” Busse told E&E News. “I think Gianforte is an anti-science governor and doesn’t want to address the reality of where we are.”

Busse also praised the young activists, including his sons, for their “urgency” when it comes to pursuing major change in his interview with E&E News.

“There’s an impatience, an urgency in today’s youth that is admirable,” Busse told the outlet. “I look at my own trajectory, and I think I have been too patient. I have not been urgent enough.”

However, Busse has not gone so far as to agree with calls from young people to call for the end of fossil fuels on the campaign trail, according to E&E News.

“They want us to do and say more, but I think we should be careful to be realists,” Busse told E&E News regarding an encounter with a young person who asked about why more politicians are not calling to abolish fossil fuels. “To advocate for a world where [fossil fuels] just go away, it’s not a political reality, and it’s not a policy reality.”

Montana State Senate Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick echoed Busse’s suggestion that making climate change a top issue is not a “political reality” in the state, he told E&E News.

“There’s not much of a market in the Montana electorate for climate change activism,” Fitzpatrick said. “It’s a topic for rich white liberals, and that’s not the Montana electorate,” Fitzpatrick told the outlet. “It’s not a topic that the regular working guy or woman has on the top of their agenda.”

Busse’s campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are two radically different candidates running radically different campaigns in what’s become a national popularity contest.

In September, the two candidates sparred in their one and only presidential debate, featuring activist moderators who might as well have been picked by the DNC. Out of the four controversial live fact-checks issued during the prime-time debate, not one of them were made against Harris, who, as the sitting vice president was allowed to claim “not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any warzone around the world [for] the first time this century.”

Kamala Harris: There's not one military member in a combat zone today.

Harris was also allowed to regurgitate the Charlottesville “very fine people” hoax debunked by Snopes, and she got away with characterizing Trump’s “bloodbath” comment as having to do with a political massacre rather than the collapse of the auto industry.

In this this clip from the Trump Harris debate…Harris lies several times.

But ABC didn’t fact check anything Harris said, which is probably why the Democrat presidential candidate walked on the set of “The View” confident she could skate through the fall election with nothing but star treatment from Oprah Winfrey and the editors of Vogue.

Only rarely are individuals summoned for acts of national rescue, but in July, Vice President @KamalaHarris received one of those calls.

Even when Harris joined the all-women panelists on ABC’s daytime Manhattan talk show, the vice president couldn’t get through the half-hour interview without stumbling. When Harris was asked whether there was anything she might have done differently than President Joe Biden over the last four years, her response was “not a thing that comes to mind.”

Donald J. Trump approves this message:

Stephen Colbert offered Harris an opportunity on CBS that very night to walk back her remarks in an election where Americans are obviously hungry for change. Harris, however, doubled down on her strategy of “no ragrets” just a month before voting ends.

“I’m obviously not Joe Biden,” she said. “So that would be one change.”

Colbert asks: "Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be and what would stay the same?"

Trump on the other hand, has continued to campaign through the hostile treatment typical of the traditional press toward Republicans. While Harris escaped fair criticism from the debate moderators with ABC, Trump was confronted with dubious “fact-checks” that are highly subjective but at this point, predictable.

Trump has responded to the antagonistic media environment by doing exactly what he did in 2015 and 2016. By embracing Twitter as an avenue of direct appeal to voters eight years ago, Trump leveraged alternative media that him to circumvent the hysterical press coverage. Once again, Trump has leveraged a changing media environment to his advantage by appearing on long-form podcasts while still participating in most of the traditional forums that define presidential elections, such as debates, press conferences, and town halls. The Republican nominee might have skipped this year’s sit down with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” but only after the network’s special was particularly egregious last cycle when Lesley Stahl combatively denounced Trump’s claims related to the Russia hoax and Hunter Biden’s laptop, which have since proven true.

Trump’s embrace of long-form podcasts for the internet have allowed the former president to do two things: 1) present a genuine image of a major candidate engaged with an in-depth discussion free from the glare and hostility of prime-time television and 2) reach millions of voters who have otherwise tuned out of establishment media as their primary medium of information.

A prime example of Trump’s authenticity powerfully showcased in an online discussion was when comedian Theo Von spoke with the ex-president about addiction.

“I had a great brother who taught me a lesson: Don’t drink. Don’t drink,” Trump said. “And he said ‘don’t smoke.’ He smoke and he drank.”

Von spoke about his own recovery for “most of the last 10 years” from “drugs and alcohol” while asking Trump about the last moments spent with his brother.

“He’d have periods where he’d get sick, very sick. And we thought we’d lose him, or we lost him, then he’d get better,” Trump said. “And that happened five or six times. I mean, well, you thought you lost him, and then he got better, and it was amazing. I mean, he was certainly very strong in that sense. I just tell people, it’s so tragic. Don’t drink. Just don’t drink.”

https://twitter.com/alx/status/1826151778582143403

“I would just do cocaine,” Von said moments later in a clip that would go viral.

Theo Von talking to Trump about c*caine is wild lmao.

Trump went on to reveal candid new details about the FBI’s investigation of assassination attempts against him with a panel of comedians for the “Flagrant” podcast. The FBI, Trump said, has yet to open the “three or so cell phones” possessed by the attempted shooter who stalked him on his Mar-a-Lago golf course.

“They had no problem getting the J6 people’s cell phones open,” Trump said. “They opened their cell phones very quickly.”

Harris, whose own messy traditional interviews have apparently failed to move the polls substantially in her favor, has been scrambling to adopt the Trump playbook while calling foul on the Republican strategy.

“Today marks one month since Donald Trump sat down with mainstream reporters,” the Harris campaign said Monday. “He pulled out of ’60 Minutes.’ He’s refusing to debate. And he’s refusing to release his medical records. What’s he hiding?”

A natural follow-up question for the vice president could be when she plans to hold a press conference, of which Trump has held several this year in addition to myriad interviews with antagonistic television hosts.

Harris, meanwhile, is now trying to adopt Trump’s campaign playbook with podcast interviews of her own, including one on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and an apparent plea to appear on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” On Wednesday, Harris will give an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News nearly a week after her town hall with Univision.

Trump will answer voters’ questions in a follow-up town hall by Univision Wednesday night.
The Democratic Party is facing a similar marketing fiasco. For years during the Biden-Harris administration (and even before then), Democrats pandered to left-wing activists and embraced radical ideas, such as sex changes for minors and “anti-racism.” At the same time, they told normal, working men, many of whom would have probably voted Democrat, that they were toxic, privileged, racist, underserving of attention or doomed to be irrelevant in the woke America of the 21st century.

Now, less than a month from Election Day, Democrats are scrambling to court the very same voters they have chastised for years.

The Harris-Walz campaign launched a media blitz over the weekend to target black and rural men and sent the Minnesota governor on a pheasant hunting trip in his home state. Of course, the hunting PR stunt was an embarrassing misfire. Walz was caught on camera whining about shoulder pain from recoil while failing to load and clear his shotgun. The gaffe only underscored the hunt’s artificiality — that it was just optics, that Walz, in reality, has no clue what he is doing when it comes to firearms, that he has no natural appeal for men. (RELATED: After Seeing Walz Fumble With A Shotgun, It Was Probably For The Best He Refused To Deploy To Iraq)

Walz even admitted at an event that his party was struggling to win over younger male voters. But, in typical fashion, he took on the tone of a holier-than-thou liberal, saying, “It’s not cool” to support Trump. It’s bad! You’re bad! Stop that! Sorry, if you’re a young man, and the clownish public school teacher is wagging his finger in your face about what is cool and what isn’t, he’s literally the last person on the planet you would ever support. Every man reading this with a pulse knows the feeling: You don’t want to be told what to do, or what to believe, especially by someone like Tim Walz.

Tim Walz is coping HARD over the fact that Trump is winning young men: “I refuse to admit that that’s real.” “This is not WWE type stuff. It’s not cool when he talks like that.” (Yes it is, actually.) pic.twitter.com/TZLpSeTwKM — johnny maga (@_johnnymaga) October 14, 2024



Meanwhile, Democrats have flooded social media with cringe ads in a desperate attempt to lure men into their camp. In perhaps the worst ad yet, paid actors pretending to be real, salt-of-the-earth men, argue they are still manly despite supporting the Harris-Walz ticket. They “aren’t afraid of women,” they say, sounding like hostages. But even a former Biden White House official ripped the ad as “condescending.”

“Yeah, the message is condescending,” Meghan Hays told CNN. “And I know it’s my party, but it just comes across as condescending, and that ad seemed like a joke to me. It’s not the way, like if a man talked to me like that, women would be up in arms … The message is just so condescending, and I think that the authenticity point is a really good one, that if Democrats really want to go after men, they need to figure out a better way to talk to them, and they need to figure out a better way that’s more genuine to who they are in their message.”

If you thought that ad of the men for Kamala was cringe, wait until you see the same group’s Tim Walz video pic.twitter.com/RtEfCDCAB2 — Brent Scher (@BrentScher) October 11, 2024

Kamala Harris is taking a more direct approach. The vice president is pretty much bribing black men by promising them forgivable small business loans based on their race. Not only is it a cynical ploy, but it is also likely illegal. Also, what will white rural men think of this proposal? They get Instagram reels of Tim Walz stalking a Minnesota field for pheasant, but the black man in the city gets a $20,000 loan. Okay, message received.

All of this will backfire, of course. Democrats should’ve taken a lesson from Bud Light, but they didn’t. You cannot Bud Light your brand for well over a decade and expect to salvage it in just one election cycle. Normal American men are not that stupid. Come Election Day, they will see this for what it is: a fake, cynical, eleventh-hour bid to convince them that what they have seen over the past several years never actually happened.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., traded blows on electric vehicle mandates and border security during their Senate debate in the critical swing state of Michigan.

"It's ruining our car industry," Rogers said of mandates related to buying and producing electric vehicles (EV) during Monday’s debate, starting one of the most heated exchanges of the event. "You're promoting Chinese technology in America."

The two candidates in Michigan’s critical Senate race have sparred over the issue of EV mandates throughout the campaign, highlighting how critical the issue is in a state that will play a major role in deciding the presidential election and control of the federal legislature.

Rogers has attempted through two debates in the race to tie President Biden and the Democratic Party’s support for EVs to Slotkin, who has countered that her support for the technology will ensure that Michigan remains competitive in the future of auto manufacturing.

MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATES CLASH ON NATIONAL SECURITY, IMMIGRATION AND ABORTION

Rogers said Democrats such as Slotkin are "killing the car business" when it comes to promoting EVs, accusing his opponent of voting for a "mandate" on EVs "at least three times."

While there has been no mandate that Americans must purchase EVs, the Biden administration has pressed emissions standards that could force automakers to ensure that up to two-thirds of their new vehicles sold are zero-emissions by 2032. According to a report in the Detroit Free Press, Slotkin voted against legislation that would have blocked the new standards, but has expressed openness to rewriting them if they would hurt U.S. automakers.

"I want that manufacturing here. I don't care what you drive, I want to build them," Slotkin said during Monday’s debate.

Candidates blame each other for border crisis

The two candidates also attempted to cast blame on the other for the situation at the southern border, with Slotkin accusing Rogers and Republicans of a campaign to kill Biden’s border legislation before it could get through Congress.

"What's going on at the southern border is a symptom of a broken immigration system," Slotkin said, accusing Republicans of using the "border as a political issue than actually do the real work and get things done."

Rogers instead blamed Democrats on the issue, calling Biden’s legislation a "terrible bill" that would have allowed for continued legal crossings, while Slotkin questioned how Rogers could claim to know better on the issue than the national Border Patrol union, which threw its support behind the deal.

Tense exchange over abortion

The debate also highlighted the two candidates' competing views on abortion, with Slotkin doubling down on campaign ads that have accused Rogers of supporting several pieces of anti-abortion legislation.

"He has shown us who he is, don’t trust him on this issue," Slotkin said.

MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATES

Rogers countered by arguing that he supported leaving the question of abortion to the voters in each state, promising not to do anything in the Senate that would undo the will of voters in Michigan who voted to make abortion a right in the state.

"I won't do anything when I go back to the United States Senate to undo the vote of the people," Rogers said.

Candidates disagree on gun control, mental health

Another tense exchange saw the two candidates trade blows over gun reform, with Slotkin acknowledging her own history with firearms but calling for tougher legislation to "go after the number one killer of children in our communities."

"It's really, really easy to understand why politicians, in the face of murdered children, don't do anything. They don't do it because they receive campaign donations and they're scared," Slotkin said. "They're scared because they don't want to lose their election, and it's terrible."

THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

Rogers countered that the issue mostly centered on the country’s struggles with mental health, and that "banning guns isn’t going" to solve the issue.

Promises to put more money back in voters' wallets

Inflation and the economy were another major issue during the debate, with Rogers appealing to voters to remember if they were better off under the leadership of Republicans four years ago.

"Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Rogers asked. "My opponent voted 100% with Biden-Harris (Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee) on all of the things that have raised your prices."

Slotkin responded by pointing to her support for bringing supply chains back to the U.S., which she argued would help bring prices down. She also hit Rogers on his lack of support for allowing the government to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices, something she said would help alleviate the pressure on middle-class families.

The Senate race in Michigan will be one of the closely watched nationally and features one of the few tight races that could determine control of the upper chamber this election.

According to the Fox News Power Rankings, the Michigan Senate race leans in the Democrats' favor. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Slotkin currently holds a slim 1.9 lead over her Republican opponent.

Even so, the race has shifted significantly since Sept. 19, when Slotkin held a 5.1 advantage over Rogers in the average.

Republicans have showed optimism about the race, with Axios reporting Tuesday that the Republicans' Senate Leadership Fund will pour another $10.5 million into Rogers' campaign for the home stretch of the election.
Voters who spoke with Fox News Digital in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, emphasized the economy's outsized role in the 2024 election next month, citing the struggles being felt by Wisconsinites across the state.

"I just know I was much better off when Trump was president," retired teacher Sharon Kaufman told Fox News Digital.

She explained that she considered how her family was doing under both the Trump-Pence administration and the Biden-Harris administration, and also looked "at all our investments and life and bills" before coming to that conclusion.

Tim Moss, who works for an alcohol distributor, explained, "the economy in and of itself is another big thing that the young people [and] older people are all stressing about."

"I think we'll be able to at least afford groceries" under Trump, Moss predicted.

"Gas prices were a lot better. Food prices were way down," said Diana Altwies, a forklift operator. "I went to the store the other day, I bought hardly anything, and I came home with maybe two bags of stuff, and it was over $50."

According to Sue Matuszak, who is retired, she could not imagine how families — such as those of her six grown children — manage to raise their own kids in the current economy. "I don't know how families really do it now," she said.

Matuszak's husband, also retired, stressed that Trump is "a businessman," and "that's what we need in our government."

'DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS': WISCONSINITES TALK HARRIS' MIDWESTERN RUNNING MATE, TIM WALZ

Altwies described Trump, who she supported in 2016 and 2020, remarking, "he's got a little bit of a loud mouth on him, but he tells it like it is."

For her, this demonstrates that Trump is fearless when it comes to speaking his mind and shows he is not afraid to stand up to anyone.

"Kamala, she just seems all giggly and hasn't really done anything they claim they have," she said.

Some of the other issues motivating these voters to support Trump again are safety, foreign policy, immigration and abortion.

FOR WISCONSIN DEMS, A 2024 WIN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE IS YEARS IN THE MAKING

"I don't like to see the babies that are destroyed every year," Matuszak said, explaining that abortion was an important issue for her.

Kaufman, on the other hand, explained, "I truly believe it should be with the woman and letting her figure out what she needs to do. It's a hard decision no matter what."

Despite advertising and messaging from Democrats claiming Trump would institute a federal ban on abortion, Kaufman said she does not believe such claims.

Matuszak also pointed to immigration, telling Fox News Digital, "I am so disappointed about the open borders that we have."

"I think if that doesn't get stopped, I think our country is really going to go down," she added.

Nobody who spoke with Fox News Digital in Waukesha County said they supported the Harris-Walz ticket.

The voters described seeing Trump and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, signs frequently throughout Waukesha County, which they said was on par with both 2016 and 2020.

They also said they have seen very few signs promoting Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn.

Fox News Digital observed a plethora of signs in general in the county, with the majority appearing to be in support of Trump-Vance and other Republicans. However, in the downtown area of the city of Waukesha, a college town, there were clusters of Harris-Walz signs.

Waukesha County was ranked as one of the top 15 battleground counties to watch across the country, per U.S. News and World Report. The Milwaukee suburban county has developed this reputation given its shift over the last decade. While Republicans have an edge throughout the area, their lead has shrunk in the county during the Trump-era.

Waukesha County's movement politically has followed a trend away from Republicans that other affluent suburbs have also experienced.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for electric vehicles (EVs) could prove to be costly to her chances in the critical swing state of Michigan.

"With Republicans beginning to embrace unions and labor, we are seeing a dramatic shift in voting behavior in Rust Belt States," Jimmy Keady, the founder and president of JLK Political Strategies, told Fox News Digital.

The comments come as the outlook for former President Donald Trump in Michigan has continued to improve in recent weeks, with Trump now holding a narrow lead of 0.9 points in the state, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.

That lead represents a roughly three-point swing in the race since the end of August, when Harris held a 2.2-point lead over the former president, according to the historic view of the polling average.

Michigan is rated a tossup state in the presidential race in the current Fox News Power Rankings.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE EMERGES

Part of the reason for Trump’s recent surge in the state could be due to the support of working class and union voters, who worry that the push towards EVs could put many of them out of jobs in the not-so-distant future.

"I think it is hurting Harris because of the Biden-Harris agenda on policies that don’t work for the working class," Michael Markey, a former Republican Michigan Congressional candidate and financial adviser, told Fox News Digital.

The Trump campaign has leaned into the narrative, releasing an ad earlier this month that warned Michigan voters about Democratic support for EVs.

"Attention autoworkers: Kamala Harris wants to end all gas powered cars," the ad said. "Crazy, but true!"

Markey believes the message is hitting home for voters in Michigan, arguing the issue is one reason Trump and the GOP have gained ground in the state.

MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATES

"It’s a slap in the face to the union workers," he said. "I think that’s why we’re seeing a lot of the polling trending in Republicans favor right now."

For her part, Harris has attempted to push back against the narrative, arguing at a rally in Flint, Michigan, earlier this month that we would "never" mandate the "kind of car you have to drive."

Nevertheless, Republicans have continued to hammer Harris both for her support of Biden administration regulations on tailpipe emissions, a push to phase-in EVs for newly built cars and heavy subsidies for EV production in the United States. They have also pointed to Harris’ plan during her 2020 run for president to transition all new vehicles built in the U.S. to zero emissions by 2030.

"They’re saying… ‘no one’s going to force you or tell you what kind of car you can drive,’ but they’re putting standards through the EPA that are basically mandating EV production," Markey said.

Markey argued that Michigan workers have a long history of being at the cutting edge of the automotive industry and do not want to see jobs lost to a product that is neither profitable nor in demand by consumers.

"The public is telling us what the next generation of cars is," Markey said. "They still want internal combustion engines, they want hybrids, but EVs… that’s not where the public is."

That could all add up to a problem in places like Michigan for Harris, Keady argued, noting the Democratic candidate’s struggles with traditional blue voting blocs such as unions.

"The Teamsters refusal to endorse is sign number one that Harris is in trouble with union workers," Keady said. "It is not just the Biden-Harris administration’s manufacturing policies that are hurting Michigan workers; their embrace of electric vehicle mandates will add an undue burden on middle-class families."

Reached for comment, a Harris campaign spokesperson referred Fox News Digital to the vice president's most recent comments on the issue at the Flint rally.

"And, Michigan let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive," Harris said at the time. "But here's what I will do: I will invest in communities like Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW. We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree"

In this final stage of the 2024 presidential election, it feels as if the only thing going well for Vice President Kamala Harris is fundraising.

Cash is pouring into her coffers on such a scale that some reports suggest the campaign is reluctant to be seen " bragging " about it.

Of course, it proves -- just as Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton did in 2016 -- that no amount of money can make up for a terrible candidate.

And boy is Kamala Harris a terrible candidate.

HOLLYWOOD ELITES FOR HARRIS: CELEBS SIGN ON FOR ANOTHER TIRED, STAR-FILLED SEQUEL

From the embarrassing, scripted, substance-free teleprompter speeches, to the terror of answering real questions, to the calamitous responses she gives even to entirely predictable questions, it’s easy to see why Kamala Harris’ previous presidential campaign collapsed into mediocrity, failure and finger-pointing after the sugar-high of its launch.

It’s harder to see why Democrats thought it would be any different this time. The only thing that changed since 2020 was Kamala Harris proving to be a flop as vice president, too.

Nevertheless, there does seem to be one group of Americans who are still feeling "the joy." Unfortunately for the Harris campaign, it’s not Black men, Hispanic women, or any other large block of voters.

Instead, it’s a very small group indeed: billionaires. Yes, the same "billionaire class" that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rails against as he waves his hands around conjuring up a socialist utopia, is all in for Kamala, according to recent reporting .

What could explain this apparent contradiction, the traditional party of the left attracting the support of capitalism’s ultimate beneficiaries?

Well, the answer is right there: the fact that these people have been such financial winners means they can afford to indulge in personally painless virtue-signaling by backing policies that would cause real hardship for the less fortunate.

Who cares if a Kamala Harris administration continues to inflate energy costs with a renewed bout of ‘climate’ extremism? The billionaires will barely notice the extra charges for their private jets. In winter time they won’t have to choose between heating their home(s) and cooking their food. They’ll most likely be in St. Bart’s anyway.

These aren’t bad people. Living and working in Silicon Valley, I know some of them personally -- for example, Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, probably the leading billionaire antagonist of Donald Trump, was years ago the lead investor in my tech startup. He recently found himself in hot water over claims that he and other billionaire donors were trying to buy outcomes, for example, more lax enforcement of antitrust laws.

But I don’t think this is about furthering business interests. They have armies of lobbyists for that.

No, supporting Kamala Harris -- or more precisely, opposing Donald Trump -- isn’t primarily a financial, or even political decision: it’s more likely to be cultural and psychological.

After all, it's hard to find a rational explanation. In every major category of policy: economic, domestic security, foreign affairs and national security, Trump’s performance in office was demonstrably superior to the Biden-Harris years.

But from the moment Trump appeared on the political scene in 2015, you could feel the wealthy elite recoil. He’s just not to their taste. They think he’s "vulgar." How appalling that he likes McDonald’s!

Of course, the cultural snobbery needs to be dressed up in some kind of principle, so they have glommed on to the notion, endlessly repeated, that Trump is a "threat to democracy." Even as the Democratic Party is the one actually undermining democracy, for example by overturning elections here in California.

For some, the psychological drive to support Kamala Harris might be the age-old motivation of assuaging guilt. In this sense, it could be seen as just another form of philanthropy. (Except that philanthropy, generally speaking, helps people.)

Now to be clear, I don’t have anything against billionaires. I support the free enterprise system wholeheartedly. My parents were working-class immigrants from Communist Hungary, so I don’t begrudge a rich person their wealth. If they’ve achieved their financial success through hard work and talent, good for them.

But as long as I can remember, my focus in politics has been helping people climb the ladder of opportunity. And it became increasingly clear to me that the establishment policy consensus of the past 50 years or so had failed working people badly.

That’s why I supported Brexit in 2016, and then Trump. It’s why the theme of my Fox News show "The Next Revolution," and the book I wrote in 2018, was "Positive Populism."

I said at the time that the Republican Party had the opportunity to become a "multiracial working class coalition." After nearly a decade of Trump leading the GOP, that opportunity has become a reality.

It’s based on economic results. During the Trump presidency, the earnings of those at the lowest levels of the income scale rose faster than those at the top, for the first time in half a century.

That’s why we’re seeing this extraordinary political transformation in America, with the GOP becoming the workers’ party while the Democrats become the party of the billionaires.

And ironically enough, it was a billionaire who did it -- Donald Trump, the blue-collar billionaire. His cultural appeal and policy success brought about a truly historic political revolution, Republicans representing the working class of all races and backgrounds, leaving the Democrats and their billionaire backers stranded as the party of the rich, white and woke.

Republican nominee for president Donald Trump is calling the idea of allowing men to play in women’s sports an idea that is “so far out” and says it puts female athletes in danger.

Appearing Monday on the Barstool Sports podcast, Bussin’ with the Boys, the former president spoke about how he hoped to unite the country if he were to win the 2024 election, Fox News reported.

“So, you want to see the country united. But you have a very conservative side and a conservative side, and then you have people that want to see an open border and things. A lot of it is so far out,” Trump explained. “Like, for instance, they want men playing in women’s sports. I don’t think I could ever say I’m thrilled about that. I’ve seen it. I’ve seen people really hurt.”

Trump pointed specifically to the Olympics in Paris this year, where two boxers suspected of having male chromosomes beat all female opponents to win gold and insisted that “The whole thing is ridiculous.”

The former president has blasted transgenderism many times. Early this month, for instance, his campaign hosted a campaign video slamming the wokeness the Biden-Harris regime has embedded into the U.S. military.

In June, he vowed to “keep the radical left-wing gender ideology away from our youth” if he were to win the presidency. He also pledged to “keep men out of women’s sports.”

Even the former president’s wife, Melania, has spoken against transgenderism. Last week, she said transgender athletes are “deepening the divisions in our society.”

Vice President Kamala Harris raised doubts on Tuesday about whether November’s election will be “free and fair.”

Harris has not yet answered if she would support certifying a Trump victory, although she has been highly critical of Republicans who objected to President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020.

“Why are people acting like this is going to be a free and fair election and he won’t try to steal it?” Charlamagne tha God asked Harris.

Harris replied the election would only be “free and fair” if Americans “stand up for that.”

“It will be a free and fair election if we, the American people, stand up for that,” Harris said before delivering a word salad.

You know, I see it as this. I think that the democracy has it’s like two points of nature. One, there’s a fact about a democracy that when it is intact, it the strength that it possesses in terms of the protection of people’s individual rights and liberties. When a democracy is intact, we protect your rights and your liberties.

Harris’s answer comes as top congressional Democrats told Axios on Thursday they would not commit to certifying the 2024 election if former President Donald Trump wins.

The failure to commit to certifying the election would prove many members to be hypocrites, including House Oversight Committee ranking member and former January 6 committee member Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who told Axios that he is unsure if he’ll certify a Trump win.

Former President Donald Trump roasted “dying” late-night comedians and Vice President Kamala Harris during a recent appearance on Full Send Podcast, hosted by the Nelk Boys, Kyle Forgeard, Steiny, and Bob Menery.

“Jimmy Kimmel’s a loser,” Trump told the Nelk Boys. “We would do Jimmy Kimmel — I did him a lot. He used to greet me on the sidewalk, outside of his studio.”

Watch Below:

“I’d come in — this was before politics, of course — but I’d come in, and he’d be standing on the sidewalk, ‘Oh, sir, may I bring you in?’ He’d bring me in every time, and then i ran for politics,” Trump explained.

The 45th president added that now, “The whole show is about talking bad about Trump.”

“They’re all equally bad,” Trump continued, adding that The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg has “a filthy, filthy mouth on her.”

“I’ve hired Whoopi over the years, you know, at hotels that I own,” the former president said. “We hired her once and she was so filthy, disgusting, dirty with her mouth that the whole group left. There was nobody watching her.”

“She was a comedian and, you know what, nobody knows this, she said, ‘I admire you so much, would you do me a favor, would you do a cameo in a movie I’m making?’ I did a cameo in some crummy movie she made, and then I run for politics,” Trump recalled.

“Joy [Behar], she thought the world was flat,” Trump added of another The View co-host. “Joy is dumb.”

Trump also recalled another The View co-host, saying, “The other one worked for me, she wrote a letter — one of them, I don’t know, whatever her name is — she worked for me in the White House she writes a letter: ‘This was the greatest experience, you’re the greatest president, I love you.'”

“We have the letter someplace,” Trump said. “It’s a letter that she wrote when she left the White House, then all of a sudden they hire her and she goes negative, you know, they said, ‘Hey, we’ll give you a lot of money if you go negative,’ whatever her name is.”

Of Jimmy Fallon, Trump said, “I hate to use — but they’re all losers, they’re all lightweights.”

“This guy, so I’m on his show before politics, many times — it makes you realize how great Johnny Carson was, actually,” the 45th president said. “Their ratings are horrible, they’re cutting him back to four days. Can you imagine cutting Johnny Carson back to four days?”

Trump then recalled a time when Fallon asked him if he could “play with my hair.”

“And I said, ‘What do you want to do that for?’ [Fallon said], ‘I want to see if it’s real.’ It is real, but if you have to do it, you can do it. So he didn’t just play, he puts his hand in my hair and he went crazy, and the audience went wild, and they loved it,” Trump said.

Watch Below:

“And six months later, he goes up on the show, and he said, ‘I’d like to apologize for doing that, I didn’t realize I was going to humanize him,” Trump recalled.

“Another loser is Howard Stern,” Trump added. “I dropped him, I didn’t want to do his show anymore. Howard Stern — because he was considering Hillary, he’s not for Hillary, but he wanted to be politically correct or something — his show’s practically dead, I think, I haven’t heard his name in years.”

Trump also noted that all Stephen Colbert does is talk about him.

“All he does is talk about me,” Trump said. “Did you ever hear of ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’? He’s got it.”

“Kimmel has it, too,” the 45th president added. “His show’s dying. Colbert’s [show] is dying.”

Of Harris, Trump said, “We’re against somebody that has no clue what’s going on,” adding that his opponent went on 60 Minutes, “she gives a horrible answer, and they change the answer.”

“I think it’s the biggest scandal in broadcast history. They actually took her answer out and gave her a different answer after it was shot,” Trump said, to which Menery replied, “Yeah, I saw that.”

Watch Below:

Trump also slammed Harris for going on the Call Her Daddy podcast during the North Carolina hurricane debacle, given that Harris is currently in office.

The Full Send Podcast is Trump’s latest podcast appearance ahead of the 2024 election, allowing viewers to see a different side of the former president.

Last week, Trump appeared on comedian Andrew Schulz’s Flagrant podcast, where he recalled “a funny story” about a time he once shut down Donald Trump Jr.’s big party at Trump Tower after his son invited way too many people over for the Fourth of July.

“Donald Trump will shut down the border just like he shut down Don Jr’s party,” one social media user reacted.

Last month, Trump joined computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman’s for an episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast.

In August, the former president sat down with comedian Theo Von’s on the popular This Past Weekend podcast, which fans raved over, calling it the “most genuine conversation” they’ve ever seen.

Trump was also interviewed by online streamer Adin Ross, who gifted him a Tesla Cybertruck wrapped with the iconic image of the 45th president raising his fist in the air after surviving the first assassination attempt on his life on July 13.

In June, Trump appeared on YouTuber star Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast.

Elsewhere in his interview with Forgeard and Menery on Full Send Podcast, Trump revealed that he will soon appear on podcasting powerhouse Joe Rogan’s The Joe Rogan Experience.

“I think Joe Rogan has to have you on, would you do that?” Forgeard asked, to which Trump replied, “Oh, sure I would. Well, I think I’m doing it, actually.”

“Yeah? So you are going to do Joe Rogan?” Forgeard queried, to which the 45th president answered, “Yeah, I am.”

Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum pressed Harris-Walz campaign senior adviser Ian Sams Tuesday about Vice President Kamala Harris’ lagging support with male voters ahead of the 2024 election.

New polling shows a widened gender gap between Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump, including among black and Latino men who are largely refraining from supporting the vice president. MacCallum cited Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who denied the existence of a gender gap during his attempt to appeal to male voters, and further asked Sams why the vice president is continuing to lose support among men.

“You hear Tim Walz reaching out to men and saying I don’t believe there is this gender gap, and you see where she’s going to talk with voters over the coming days and she is reaching out to that male voter. So why do you think she has lost six points since 2020 with male voters? Why do you think that is? What’s behind that?” MacCallum asked.

“Well I think we’ll see in 3 weeks when the votes get counted what the actual gender gap split is and I think right now you can ask the exact same question, which is why Donald Trump is losing women by exponentially more than in 2020,” Sams said, leading MacCallum to repeat the question. “Well I don’t think that the national polls necessarily reflect an accurate snapshot. I think that in each battleground state, we’re seeing different numbers, we’re seeing her grow her support. The longer she talks about her ideas, including her economic ideas for the middle class, I think she’s growing that support every single day.”

MacCallum noted that Harris is doing media appearances on shows with large male audiences, including with Charlamagne Tha God and possibly on podcaster Joe Rogan’s popular show, “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Sams said Trump is spending all of his time participating in “bro podcasts.” (RELATED: Sunny Hostin Says Harris Being Interviewed By Joe Rogan Would Help Her With Men Voters)

“Okay, so you’re saying it’s not happening,” MacCallum replied. “We’ll see, but she’s clearly spending a lot of time trying to reach those male voters and she has said ‘that I know I have to earn those male votes’ and clearly that seems to be one of the priorities for the campaign.”

Harris plans to appear in a town hall hosted by Charlamagne Tha God in Detroit, Michigan, Tuesday and is reportedly in talks to appear on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Eight-one percent of Rogan’s audience is male and 56% are between the ages of 18-34, according to a YouGov poll.

A New York Times/Siena College poll found Trump with a 51% to 40% advantage among male voters while Harris holds a 53% to 38% advantage among women voters. The former president holds a 57% advantage among Latino men ages 35-49, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll from Oct. 7.

Harris is currently leading among young black men by a historically low 41%, dropping significantly from President Joe Biden’s 53% in 2020 and former President Barack Obama’s 81% in 2012, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said on Monday.

Little noticed but high-stakes elections on the November ballot will be for seats on state Supreme Courts, where legal precedents will be set on matters such as abortion, election integrity, gun rights, redistricting and other issues.

In 2024, 82 state Supreme Court seats are to be decided by voters in 33 states and Guam, according to Ballotpedia. Of those, 18 races are partisan, 34 are nonpartisan and 30 are retention elections, meaning that rather than deciding between two candidates, voters will determine whether a justice typically appointed by a governor will remain on the state’s high court. However, some of the races have already been decided, while other candidates are running unopposed on the November ballot.

Some of these judicial contests are happening in key battleground states, such as Arizona, Michigan and North Carolina, where turnout will almost certainly be high for the presidential contest.

"Across the nation, as the federal Supreme Court is tearing back the role of the federal court, you’ve seen an increased role for state courts," said David Porter, a former Michigan assistant attorney general.

In Michigan, where Democrats hold a 4-3 majority on the state's high court, two Supreme Court seats are being contested. Although races are nonpartisan, state parties endorse a candidate.

Andrew Fink, a Republican state representative, is running against Kimberly Thomas, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, for an open seat.

Incumbent Supreme Court Judge Kyra Harris Bolden was appointed by Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November 2022. This year she is running to retain her seat against Patrick O’Grady, a state circuit court judge. Whitmer appointed Bolden to fill a vacancy left by the departure of Judge Bridget Mary McCormack.

"In the last two decades, the state Supreme Court was led by a conservative majority," Porter said. "We are now seeing a big shift. Liberal justices have taken control and are more interested in revisiting decisions of the past 20 years."

Porter described Justice Elizabeth Clement as a swing vote; so, if Democrats expand their majority to 5-2, it could sometimes be 6-1 decisions.

MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATES CLASH ON NATIONAL SECURITY, IMMIGRATION AND ABORTION

In Arizona, voters will determine if two Republican-appointed justices, Clint Bolick and Katheryn Hackett King, will remain on that state's high court.

It’s not clear if voters are noticing state Supreme Court cases more, but political donors seem to, said former Arizona Solicitor General Dominic Draye.

"I don’t know if voters are paying more attention to these races, but there is more out-of-state money being spent than in the past retention races," Draye told Fox News Digital. "I don’t remember before seeing yard signs. Now I see yard signs everywhere, and I’m getting mailers to retain or don’t retain."

ARIZONA SUPREME COURT RULES 98,000 PEOPLE WHOSE CITIZENSHIP IS UNCONFIRMED CAN VOTE IN PIVOTAL ELECTION

All seven justices are Republican appointees, and two are up for retention in November. If the seats open up, Democrat Gov. Katie Hobbs would pick their replacements.

"It has devolved into a policy debate instead of a debate about whether a judge can be fair and impartial," Draye said. "There are people who want to obtain certain outcomes in the judicial process and change the composition of the court."

In North Carolina, Republicans have a 5-2 state Supreme Court majority and aim to make it 6-1. Incumbent Judge Allison Riggs, a Democrat, is running against Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, a state appeals court judge.

Although Nevada is a fiercely contested battleground state between presidential candidates, three incumbent state Supreme Court judges, Elissa Caddish, Patricia Lee and Lidia Stiglich, are running unopposed and have nothing to worry about from the likely high voter turnout.

PA GOV TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER SUPREME COURT REJECTS GOP BID TO OVERTURN ELECTION LAW ‘USURPATIONS’

Meanwhile, another high-profile state on the national stage, Georgia, already had state Supreme Court elections in May.

Though not a battleground in the presidential race, other states will likely have high voter turnout for competitive Senate races that will trickle down to the Supreme Court races.

Montana has two nonpartisan high court races. One is between Broadwater County Attorney Cory Swanson and former federal magistrate Jerry Lynch. Another is between two district judges, Katherine Bidegaray and Dan Wilson.

Ohio also has a highly competitive Senate race, another incentive for voters to turn out. The state has a 4-3 Republican majority. One Ohio race has two incumbent justices.

Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Justice Joseph Deters in 2023 to fill the remaining term of Justice Sharon Kennedy after Kennedy won the chief justice seat. But Deters opted to remain on the court and is challenging another incumbent, Democrat Justice Melody Stewart.

Also in Ohio, Democrat Justice Michael Donnelly is facing Republican challenger Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County judge. Democrat Lisa Forbes, a state appeals court judge, is facing Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County judge, for an open seat.

In Kentucky, conservative-leaning Chief Justice Laurance VanMeter is retiring at the end of his term. That leaves a nonpartisan race for a vacant seat between Lexington attorney Erin Izzo and Pamela R. Goodwine, an appeals court judge who has the backing of Democrat Gov. Andy Beshear. Though the winner of the race will fill a vacant seat, the next chief justice will be chosen by colleagues on the court.

Two of the nation’s largest states also have Supreme Court races in November.

In Texas, three Republican justices are facing Democrat challengers, who are all district judges. GOP incumbent Jimmy Blacklock is facing Democrat DaSean Jones; GOP Justice John Devine faces Democrat Christine Weems; and Justice Jane Bland is fending off Democrat Bonnie Lee Goldstein.

In Florida, two justices, Renatha Francis and Meredith Sasso, have retention elections. Both are appointees of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Former President Trump issued a full-throated endorsement of incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Truth Social.

"While I have Endorsed Ted, on numerous occasions, verbally, because of the Importance of the Race, and Ted’s Importance to the future of our Country, I thought the Endorsement should be memorialized in writing," Trump declared in a post.

Cruz — who has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently seeking a third term — is facing off in the 2024 Texas U.S. Senate race against Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred, who has served in the House since 2019.

CRUZ RACE NOW A TOSS-UP SHOULD BE WARNING FOR TEXAS GOP, SAYS EXPERT

The two men are slated to debate on Tuesday night.

"Ted is one of the strongest Senators in the Country on Border Security, whereas his Opponent, Colin Allred, is a Radical Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST. Ted, on the other hand, will ALWAYS put Texas, and America, FIRST," Trump said in another post on Truth Social. "Ted Cruz has my Complete and Total Endorsement - HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!"

"Thank you!! Vote Trump! Vote Cruz!" the Lone Star State senator tweeted in response to Trump's messages.

Liberal talk show host Bill Maher said he wasn't worried that former President Trump would win the 2024 race or target him if he returned to the White House, saying he's not letting himself panic about the election, this time around.

On his "Club Random" podcast on Sunday, Maher debated his guest, Dr. Phil McGraw, on a variety of topics, including illegal immigration, anti-Israel extremism on college campuses, and the current polarization in America. At one point, Dr. Phil addressed Maher's strong feelings about the former president, asking the liberal host what he would do, "if Trump wins."

"Nothing," Maher replied. "Nothing. Going on with my show and making jokes at his expense every week."

"And that's why this is a great country. Because as crazy as he is, you know, he didn't do anything about it the first time. So I'm just not going to lose my nervous system about it," he continued.

BILL MAHER DOUBLES DOWN ON ELECTION PREDICTION BUT WARNS DEMOCRATS ‘TRUMPISM’ IS HERE TO STAY

Maher immediately went on to clarify that he still believes the former president is capable of imprisoning his critics.

"Now, he could. He's insane, so he could start sending people to Guantánamo Bay. I don't put anything past this guy," Maher continued.

"He thinks they're eating the cats and the dogs. But am I going to worry about it? First of all, I'm not going to worry about it, Phil, because he's not going to win," Maher argued.

Following the presidential debate in September, Maher confidently predicted that Trump's election chances were "over" and Vice President Kamala Harris would win the November election.

"I've been known as a Trump alarmist, and now I'm saying I'm not even nervous," he told Dr. Phil on the podcast.

"It's going to be close. The polls will be dead even on Election Day," he said.

Maher argued that Americans had become fatigued by the former president over the years and had reached a breaking point.

"We're talking about a few hundred thousand people perhaps, but I think it's going to be a little closer than that," he said about the razor-thin race.

Back in March, Maher said he would do "everything he can" to stop Trump from winning in November.

At the time, he was uncertain if President Biden or Trump would win the election. He quipped Trump would either "blow up the world or put me in Guantánamo Bay or whatever," if re-elected, adding "but I just cannot worry about it constantly."

With just over three weeks to go until Election Day, a trio of new national polls suggest Trump is erasing gains made by Harris the last couple of months since she replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

Harris edged Trump 50%-48% among likely voters questioned in an ABC News/Ipsos poll, down from a six-point lead for the vice president last month.

The two candidates are deadlocked at 48%, according to a NBC News poll of registered voters nationwide, after Harris enjoyed a five-point advantage a month ago.

Additionally, a CBS News/YouGov nonprobability based survey of likely voters indicated Harris with a three-point edge over Trump, slightly down from a four-point advantage a month ago.

Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.
A hearing was held Tuesday in a key Georgia county’s lawsuit against the State Elections Board (SEB), roughly three weeks until voters head to the polls on Nov. 5.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney is overseeing the case filed by the Cobb County Board of Elections earlier this month. The bipartisan board is taking issue with a set of new rules imposed by the SEB, including a measure to require county election workers to hand count ballots after polls close to ensure accurate machine tabulation.

The rule has also sparked a lawsuit filed by Georgia Democratic officials, which is set for a hearing on Wednesday.

Cobb County is a majority suburban area anchored by the city of Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

During the Tuesday hearing, attorneys for the SEB argued that there were no limitations on when election rules can be passed and pointed out that the specific hand-counting rule applies only to the ballots themselves, not tallying individual votes cast on the ballots.

"All we are doing is saying, you need to [have] receipts of votes cast, mirror the number that the machine says were cast," the lawyer said.

But McBurney noted that it was "late in the game" for the SEB to change election rules but also conceded that, in a vacuum, wanting to ensure that the number of ballots cast matched the machine-count was a "laudable goal."

GEORGIA DEMS CHAIR REVEALS MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED GOP VOTERS AS HARRIS WORKS TO BUILD BROAD BASE

"Why wouldn’t we just pause, especially on the hand-count rule, given what looks like a fairly robust record of chaos that it is sowing?" the judge asked the defendants’ lawyer.

"I'm asking you from a practical perspective, if the goal is orderly, reliable elections, why the prudent — in terms of reasonableness approach — wouldn't be to say, 'Let's try this next election,' when all those questions can be answered with no one having to sue?"

Republican Party officials have held the rule up as a critical guardrail to ensuring voters can be confident in their elections, but Democrats contend that its goal is to foment doubt in the process.

The Cobb County lawsuit argued the rules put elections boards across the state in "an untenable position."

An attorney in support of the plaintiffs later pointed out the state officials who have come out in opposition to the rules changes, including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

"All of them are concerned about the impact of this rule," the lawyer said.

TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE

"It would be one thing in an ideal sterile environment to have people who are fresh and energized sit down and count ballots… That's not how this is going to play out. In reality, as our petitioner affidavits reference, poll workers get to their polls as early as 5 a.m., 5:30, 6 a.m. They stay as late as 8 p.m., 10 p.m. And so we're talking about adding something on top of an already 14- to 16-hour day when people are exhausted."

McBurney pointed out that it could then be done the next day, to which the attorney responded, "But then there are challenges that come with that as well, Your Honor."

The judge said the hand-counting ballots rule "does not directly interfere with the certification work going on" but that it "will be a resource drain, no question."

But the SEB attorney later criticized the plaintiffs’ arguments as conjecture.

"All that it says over and over again is, quote, ‘I am concerned about the rule’s last minute adoption….I am concerned that the Cobb County Elections Office lacks space. I am concerned that the hand-count rule may lead to delays," he said.

"It is hypothetical on top of conjecture, on top of speculation. There is no imminent threat here. There is a threat of potential things that might happen if the worst-case scenario comes up, and that's simply not sufficient for declaratory judgment."

McBurney heard the case the same day as he issued a decision in a separate Georgia elections case, ruling that county elections supervisors are not allowed to delay certification of results on the grounds of their own suspicions of fraud or mistakes.

There are a flurry of lawsuits expected around the vote count and voter access this election, as there are virtually every presidential election cycle.
More than 230 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are calling on former President Trump to release his medical records after Vice President Kamala Harris did so.

In an open letter dated Oct. 13, first reported by CBS News, the health care providers raise concerns about Trump's advanced age and argue that the 78-year-old Republican nominee should be transparent about his health and medical history.

"On August 20, Donald Trump said he would ‘very gladly’ release his medical records. In the 55 days since, he has yet to do so," the letter states. "With no recent disclosure of health information from Donald Trump, we are left to extrapolate from public appearances. And on that front, Trump is falling concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office and displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity."

Most of the signatories support Harris for president. The letter asserts that Trump appears to "ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances" during his campaign events and questions whether this behavior is the result of cognitive changes associated with old age.

HARRIS GOADS TRUMP TO RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS AFTER SHE GETS CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH FROM PERSONAL PHYSICIAN

"The American people deserve to have confidence in their elected officials' mental and physical capacity to do the jobs that they've elected them to do. Trump ought to be going above and beyond to provide transparency on his physical health and mental acuity, given his advancing age."

The letter comes while Harris is goading Trump into releasing his health information after the White House put out a "Healthcare Statement" on Saturday that declared her to be in "excellent health."

WHITE HOUSE CORRECTS RECORD ON BIDEN'S PHYSICIAN, PARKINSON'S EXPERT MEETING, SAYS IT WAS FOR PRESIDENT'S CARE

The statement from Harris' doctor also indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.

"He won't put out his medical records," Harris said Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's "staff" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes," particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

WHITE HOUSE RELEASES MEDICAL REPORT ON VP KAMALA HARRIS

"It may be because they think he's just not ready and unfit and unstable and should not have that level of transparency for the American people," Harris suggested.

The Trump campaign responded by pointing out several times the former president has voluntarily released updates about his health. They also noted that he shared records from a July screening conducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.

"All have concluded [Trump] is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. "He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history." Meanwhile, Cheung slammed Harris as being "unable to keep up with demands of campaigning," arguing that compared to Trump her schedule "is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump."

Trump himself reacted to Harris' medical statement on social media, calling it "really bad."

"With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for President!" he wrote. "MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!"

Despite an uptick in interviews, several weeks on the stump, three years as vice president, months spent campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, four years as a senator and seven as California attorney general, many Americans still don’t think they know the "real" Kamala Harris.

How can that be? Remaining undefined after all this time as a public figure is astonishing. Equally shocking is Harris’ obvious terror of being in the spotlight. That’s the only plausible explanation for the "word salads" that are tossed to interviewers when a teleprompter goes missing. Or the ill-timed bursts of laughter meant to cover her anxiety.

As Maureen Dowd wrote recently in The New York Times, "Even when getting softballs from supportive TV hosts, Harris at times seemed unsure of how to answer."

VP KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT DOWN WITH CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR BRET BAIER FOR FIRST FORMAL FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

True, she did well during her debate against former President Donald Trump, but that performance required weeks of rehearsal and memorization, a giant assist from partisan moderators and – let’s be honest – an inexpert opponent.

Why is Harris so insecure? One possibility is that it is because she knows she is not qualified, and that she has landed on this lofty perch for all the wrong reasons. That she became V.P., because Joe Biden had promised to pick a woman of color, and not because of her accomplishments. And that she was tapped to be the 2024 nominee because Democrat pooh-bahs realized a diminished Biden could not beat Donald Trump and ran out of time to find someone better.

Another explanation is that Kamala Harris is pretending to be something she is not: a moderate politician. She may be struggling to mask her progressive beliefs, the ones she ran on unsuccessfully in 2019. Her father was a Marxist economist and her mother a liberal activist; both presumably had some influence on their daughter as she grew up in San Francisco.

Harris has said her core values have not changed, but that would suggest that her flip-flopping on important issues like fracking and Medicare-for-All are political gambits, meant to reassure critical centrist voters. After all, she didn’t hold leftist opinions in college; she held them just five years ago. To broaden her appeal, she may be lying about a great many things; that would make anyone uncomfortable.

AXELROD SAYS ‘UPSCALE’ NC HARRIS VOTERS WILL FIND WAY TO VOTE AFTER STORM, NOT SURE ABOUT RURAL TRUMP FANS

A third possibility is that the vice president has no core beliefs, no central well of values that would inform her policies. The late President Reagan believed in small government and peace through strength; Donald Trump echoes those ideas and in addition believes in putting America first. The Times’ David Brooks suggests that Harris "needs to show the American people her strongest, most acute and controlling desire, the ruling passion of her soul." It’s quite possible she doesn’t have one.

Her party is panicking as the inadequacies of their candidate become more obvious. Like sports fans tossing water bottles to a bedraggled marathoner, Democrats are bombarding Kamala with advice. Recent polls suggest she may lose to Donald Trump, they are desperate to help.

Maureen Dowd, writing in the New York Times, says Harris must "distance herself from Biden when she needs to…" and "make the case for herself more assertively." Harris does not know how to make the case at all, much less "assertively."

James Carville, the wily old Democrat kingmaker, says the VP "should scare the crap out of voters." That’s hard to do that when you’re scared yourself.

JAMES CARVILLE ADMITS HE'S 'SCARED TO DEATH' ABOUT ELECTION DAY

New York Times Opinion columnist and author Charles Blow hilariously opines that Harris doesn’t need to "pull back from conveying joy" but quotes a pollster as saying she must "layer specific issues like housing affordability and health care "under the overarch of joy." Blow says, "The campaign doesn’t need a post-joy strategy, but it definitely needs an "in- addition-to-joy strategy." Imagine an adult actually writing those words.

My favorite advice to Harris, though, comes from Jonathan Martin, who writes in Politico that Kamala "ought to consider preemptively naming Mitt Romney as her Secretary of State," asking "what better way to convey to middle-of-the-road voters that you mean what you say about putting Republicans in your government?" That, despite Romney refusing to endorse Harris.

Dowd is puzzled that Kamala, "Didn’t sit down with a yellow pad or laptop long ago and decide why she wanted to be president, what her top priorities would be and how she would get that stuff done. The Vision Thing." Dowd must know there’s a good chance that Harris doesn’t have a vision.

Democrats are anxious but have only themselves to blame. After pushing Joe Biden out of the race and seeing their party rush to embrace the usurper, party leaders thought they had the Oval Office in the bag. Trump, after all, was a convicted felon who threatened democracy and wanted to ban abortions nationwide. That was their (dishonest) story and they were convinced it was enough to repeat the 2020 win.

Voters, though, wanted more. And especially… more from Kamala Harris. For a while, the excitement of the convention and her inaugural appearances masked frustration with her unrevealing campaign. But very soon her refusal to take interviews and shunning of non-scripted moments of any kind grew stale; while COVID made it easy for Joe Biden to hide in his basement, similarly avoiding scrutiny, Harris has no such excuse.

With polls tightening, her team is trying anything and everything to regain her momentum. They set her up for a flurry of interviews, most of which were so bad they ended up featured in Trump-Vance ads.

Her admission to the hosts of the View that she would not change a single policy or action of Biden’s over the past three and a half years was the corker; even former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod called it the worst of all possible responses.

Given her vow that "We’re Not Going Back," he is right. Sticking with the policies that have delivered so many failures over the past three years shows Harris is also not inclined to move forward.

U.S. allies have taken advantage of the United States as well, former President Donald Trump said during an appearance with the Economic Club of Chicago.

The discussion largely centered around tariffs, as Trump defended his position to interviewer, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, who is against tariffs.

“Many people would say the biggest problem with your tariffs is actually geopolitics. You’ve got some credit for effectively saying there was a cold war against China. That’s what America was in the last cold war against the Soviet Union. America won it in part because it rallied allies to it. You’re talking about slamming allies with 30 percent, 20 percent tariffs. Isn’t this time you’re going to end up trying to rally the West and you’re dividing it instead” Micklethwait asked.

“You keep on bringing up these individual examples, but the overall effect is going to be dramatic,” he contended, to which Trump disagreed, bringing up China. However, Micklethwait pushed back, asking again about allies.

“Our allies have taken advantage of us more so than our enemies,” Trump said. “We have a trade deficit of $300 billion with the European Union. Our allies are Japan.”

Trump told a brief story about his relationship with Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, who he described as a good friend. He described one conversation between the two of them, when Trump told them they had to speak about trade.

Trump said he responded by saying that he could not believe “how many years it’s been that nobody even negotiated with us in America.”

“I said, Shinzo, you have to pay for your cars. You’re sending millions of cars. You don’t accept a car from us. You don’t have one car that you accept, and yet we’re selling 3 million, 4 million of your cars. I said, Shinzo on agriculture, you won’t even accept our agriculture. And I renegotiated the whole trade deal from a little disadvantage, because I was stuck with a bad deal,” he said.

“We have the worst trade deals all over the world,” Trump continued, adding that “there’s no way a rational human being would ever sign the trade deals that this country signed.”

“And I got out of many of those deals,” he added.

Legacy media are working overtime to delegitimize a new report indicating Kamala Harris allegedly plagiarized parts of a book she co-authored.

The cover-up began on Monday shortly after the Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo reported findings by Austrian “plagiarism hunter” Stefan Weber, who purportedly discovered that a 2009 book co-authored by Harris and Joan O’C. Hamilton contains passages seemingly lifted from various other published works and websites. The book is titled Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer.

Rufo noted how “[s]ome of the passages [Weber] highlighted appear to contain minor transgressions — reproducing small sections of text; insufficient paraphrasing — but others seem to reflect more serious infractions, similar in severity to those found in Harvard president Claudine Gay’s doctoral thesis.” The report cited numerous examples in which Harris and her co-author seemingly lifted text from sources such as an NBC News article, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice press release, and a Wikipedia article.

In an effort to run damage control for Harris’ flailing campaign, the anti-speech New York Times dispatched three “journalists” to pen an article aimed at undercutting Rufo’s reporting. Replaying their worn-out “Republicans pounce!” playbook with the headline “Conservative Activist Seizes on Passages From Harris Book,” authors Stephanie Saul, Vimal Patel, and Dylan Freedman attempted to convince Times readers that the massive scandal is just another “right-wing” nothingburger.

“In a review of the book, The New York Times found that none of the passages in question took the ideas or thoughts of another writer, which is considered the most serious form of plagiarism. Instead, the sentences copy descriptions of programs or statistical information that appear elsewhere,” they deceptively wrote before admitting the passages cited by Rufo “appeared to have been taken partly from other published work without quotation marks.”

The investigation was conducted by Dr. Stefan Weber, a famed Austrian "plagiarism hunter" who has taken down politicians in the German-speaking world. We independently confirmed multiple violations, which are comparable in severity to the plagiarism found in former Harvard… pic.twitter.com/P9DTpZS4kV — Christopher F. Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) October 14, 2024

In one example discovered by Weber and subsequently reported by Rufo, Harris and O’C. Hamilton seemingly lifted “verbatim language from an uncited NBC News report” when writing about high school graduation statistics in their book.

The bolded parts from the following book passage are the “duplicated material[s]” seemingly taken from the NBC report, according to Rufo.

In Detroit’s public schools, only 25 percent of the students who enrolled in grade nine graduated from high school, while 30.5 percent graduated in Indianapolis public schools and 34 percent received diplomas in the Cleveland Municipal City School District. Overall, about 70 percent of the U.S. students graduate from public and private schools on time with a regular diploma, and about 1.2 million students drop out annually. Only about half of the students served by public school systems in the nation’s largest cities receive diplomas.

That apparently wasn’t questionable enough for Saul, Patel, and Freedom to do actual reporting. Instead, the three took their Democrat activism a step further by contacting a so-called “plagiarism expert” to downplay the findings.

In his remarks to the Times, New Orleans-based plagiarism consultant Jonathan Bailey acted as if he could read Harris’ mind on the subject, saying the vice president’s alleged plagiarism “amounts to an error and not an intent to defraud.” He later clarified in an X post he has “NOT performed a full analysis of the book,” adding that his “quotes were based on information provided to [him] by the reporters and [he] spoke only about those passages.”

And if their desperation to cover for Harris wasn’t pathetic enough, the Times authors went out of their way to insinuate that Rufo’s examination of Harris and other left-wing partisans’ literary works for potential acts of plagiarism was racially motivated. Citing his work in exposing Harvard’s Claudine Gay and academics promoting DEI ideology, the authors wrote, “Some academics, however, have characterized [Rufo’s] campaign as racist.”

Left-wing outlets such as The Daily Beast and CNN followed the Times’ lead in using the “Republicans pounce!” framing in their respective coverage of the bombshell. The latter outlet, however, admitted that its review of “several of the passages highlighted by Rufo … found that Harris and O’C. Hamilton failed to properly attribute language to sources.”

Youth sex trafficking and its myriad cruelties tripled under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a report in TheFreePress.com.

TheFreePress.com described some of the harms inflicted on youth migrants under the lax policies set by Biden’s border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas’ tenure:

Sex-trafficking victims often suffer horrific abuse, as I discovered when I spoke to Landon Dickeson, the 36-year-old executive director for Bob’s House of Hope in Denton, Texas, the only shelter for male sex-trafficking victims ages 18 and up in the country. Dickeson says they’ve seen teens from Central and South America who have been so tortured by their traffickers they can barely function. Dickeson described caring for teens who have brain damage from being so heavily drugged—teens who have had their fingernails pulled out, and lemon juice poured on wounds. When I asked to interview one of their migrant residents, Dickeson said they simply weren’t in any condition to speak to anyone, much less a reporter. “We think the cartels and gangs use torture as a control method for the males,” said Dickeson. “They’re not going to fight back if they chain their victims to a radiator, beat them up frequently, or drug them.”

The abuse and prostitution may be forced on young migrants who are indebted to smugglers and their affiliated trafficking gangs in the United States. If they cannot pay their debts, their families can lose farms and homes to the banks that hold the loans.

The rising number of youth sex-trafficking cases were posted at the Department of Health and Human Services when TheFreePress demanded the data under the Freedom of Information Act. The agency is responsible for checking and issuing Certification and Eligibility Letters to the children and youths who first request aid after escaping sex traffickers.

The agency issued 1,143 letters in 2021, 2,226 letters in 2022, and 2,148 letters in 2024 under the welcome policies set by border chief Alejandro Mayorkas. The agency has not posted any data since the first week of September 2023.

The incomplete data adds up to 5,517 letters since October 2020, or an average of 1,8,37 letters per year.

Under President Donald Trump, the number of letters averaged 562 per year — or just one-third of the record reached under the guidance of pro-migration progressives.

The number of child cases under Biden and Mayorkas is three times their adult caseload, according to the agency data.

Mayorkas’ easy migration policies were unchallenged by Harris when she “ran away” from the border issue in 2021 as Biden tried — weakly — to get control over Mayorkas and his business backers. She also endorsed Mayorkas’ overall policies in her campaign’s economic platform.

There is likely to be some fraud in the process — like in the “U Visa” for crime victims — because it allows youths to be treated as refugees and put on a fast track to the very valuable prize of citizenship.

But there is much evidence that many of the 540,000 “Unaccompanied Alien Children” welcomed by Mayorkas either volunteer for abusive work or are forced into abusive work. At least 50 percent of the UACs are older teenagers or are young men who pretend to be younger than 19.

Federal investigations into sexual trafficking of UACs under President Donald Trump were stymied when then-Sen. Kamala Harris added language to a spending bill that barred information-sharing with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Federal agencies have done little to stop the sex trafficking, whistleblowers told TheFreePress:

Deborah White, another whistleblower who worked at the same [government-funded] shelter, testified that migrant children were handed over to improperly vetted sponsors who used fraudulent IDs and different addresses to procure numerous unrelated children. “I had multiple cases that I reported on,” said White, meaning she reported suspicious sponsors to her supervisor. “One in particular where we sent 329 children to one address: two garden apartment [buildings] in Houston, Texas.” The supervisor, White told The Free Press in an interview, took no steps to investigate further, but instead told White that she wasn’t moving migrants out of the facility quickly enough.

Amid the youths’ sexual torture, prostitution, and trafficking, progressives have happily thrown charges of bigotry and racism at the Americans who want their border laws enforced.

Trump “has been tapping into a long and tawdry history of US nativism by fearmongering about immigration for some time now. He keeps at it because bigotry and racism offer some of the essential glue that binds his coalition together and makes it such a robust and incendiary political force,” claimed Timothy O’Brien, the senior executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, in March 2024.

“Immigration has always been a building block of US … economic might,” he added.

Part of that migrant-enabled “economic might” comes from the covert employment of child migrants. In February 2023, the New York Times described the scale of workplace abuse, complete with photographs and captions:

Cristian works a construction job instead of going to school. He is 14 … Carolina packages Cheerios at night in a factory. She is 15 … Wander starts looking for day-labor jobs before sunrise. He is 13.

But the newspaper stopped following the child-labor issue it touched on Mayorkas and his Extraction Migration economic policy.

Similarly, the New York Times has posted intermittent articles about the sexual abuse of migrants — but it does not allow the coverage to taint the progressives’ claim to be the good guys in migration policy or the establishment’s narrative that the United States is a “Nation of Immigrants.”

In general, editors at establishment media sides prefer to hire pro-migration reporters to cover the migration beat. In turn, those reporters focus their empathy on migrants’ preferences — and also hide the myriad harms and economic distortions caused by their favored policie.s

In September 2023, federal agencies and Houston police announced they had arrested 10 human traffickers:

“Numerous young girls will no longer be raped, sexually exploited and beaten by the individuals arrested during this operation thanks to the efforts made by our partners at the Houston Police Department, the U.S. Marshals Service, Homeland Security Investigations and the agencies who make up the Human Trafficking Rescue Alliance,” said FBI Houston acting Special Agent in Charge David Martinez. “Tragically, hundreds more underage sex trafficking victims won’t be rescued because we do not know about them. Without the public’s help, tormented sex trafficking victims remain in the clutches of manipulative criminals who seek only to enrich themselves at the expense of vulnerable juveniles.”

The successful operation got minimal media coverage. Mayorkas’ DHS press office did not announce the arrest. But five days later, however, the media office announced a new service to help migrants apply for benefits.

Weirdly, Mayorjkas repeatedly describes himself as a moral champion for migrants because of his migrant parents, his sympathy for migrants, and his support for “equity” between Americans and foreigners.

In May 2023, Mayorkas explained his pro-migration motivation during a graduation speech to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy:

My drive has been defined by a very clear purpose. My mother’s and father’s life journeys were defined by displacement. My mother was twice a refugee, first from war-torn Europe and, 19 years later, with my father, my sister, and me from the communist takeover of Cuba … They are the primary engine of my drive, and the primary reason why I work so hard, my purpose.

Breitbart News covers the sexual trafficking and labor abuse of children and youths enabled by Mayorkas.

Breitbart News also covers the thousands of migrant deaths and massive foreign destruction encouraged by Mayrokas and his Extraction Migration economic strategy.
Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied in battleground Michigan, according to a new public opinion poll.

Fox News' Power Rankings have moved Michigan into the toss-up column, with both parties making a strong play for Rust Belt voters. The race has tightened significantly, with voters split along generational and gender lines, according to an AARP poll conducted Oct. 2-8.

With a full ballot including all third-party candidates, Harris and Trump are tied at 46% support each, the survey said. Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. still receives 3% support even though he endorsed Trump in August. All other third-party candidates polled at a combined 2%.

In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by just one point, 49%-48%.

VP KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT DOWN WITH CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR BRET BAIER FOR FIRST FORMAL FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

The survey is consistent with other AARP polls that have pointed to a generational divide.

Harris leads by double digits among voters 18-34 and 65+, while Trump polls stronger among voters 35-49 and 50-64.

Voters are split by gender as well. "There is a very large gender gap of a net 40-points among voters overall and 29-points among voters 50+, with Harris strong with women voters and Trump with men," the survey release states.

The AARP poll also finds a competitive race for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.

Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a three-term House lawmaker, holds a narrow 49%-46% lead over Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers.

The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.9%.

Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called "Blue Wall."

The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

Trump visited Michigan last Thursday and delivered a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, where he announced proposals to make interest on auto loans tax-deductible, slash corporate taxes for American manufacturers and threatened up to 1,000% tariffs on foreign-imported vehicles if he returns to the White House.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ history as a federal prosecutor instilled in her a direct, sometimes adversarial communication style that reportedly alienated Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their first private sit-down, leaving him "disgruntled" and defensive just days before Russian troops invaded his country.

Their tense sit-down was chronicled in "War," the new book by Bob Woodward. In the book, Woodward details some of the most consequential foreign policy and security challenges overseen by President Biden during his first term. Among them, Russia’s 2022 invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine.

Fox News obtained an early copy of the book, which is available in bookstores today.

As Woodward reports, Biden deployed Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, less than a week before Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops commenced their full-scale invasion of Ukraine – with the sole mission of convincing Zelenskyy that the Russian incursion was imminent, based on all available U.S. intelligence and the hundreds of thousands of troops it had confirmed Russia had been amassing nearby, including some 40,000 soldiers near the Belarusian border.

Harris was to demonstrate unified support for Ukraine from the U.S. and NATO, and to help Zelenskyy accept the fact that this was, indeed, happening.

However, Woodward reports, aspects of that mission backfired – at least behind closed doors.

Publicly, Harris delivered a winning speech, effectively reassuring the world of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and Article 5. It is considered among her major achievements as vice president.

HUNTER BIDEN LEGAL SAGA IS ‘REAL WAR’ THAT 'PREOCCUPIED' OUTGOING PRESIDENT, NEW WOODWARD BOOK CLAIMS

In private, however, Zelenskyy was immediately put off by Harris’s brusque communication style and "forceful" demeanor during their sit-down, during which Harris and her national security adviser, Philip Gordon, wore masks and did not attempt to shake hands with their Ukrainian counterparts upon entering the room.

Though Germany was still under COVID-19 protocols, the icy start to the meeting "disgruntled" Zelenskyy, Woodward said, and left the Ukrainian president feeling "like he was about to be reprimanded" at a frightening and vulnerable time for his nation.

"You need to take seriously the likelihood that any day the Russians will invade your country," Harris told him forcefully.

In Woodward's telling, things between the two did not improve from there.

Harris, a successful former federal prosecutor and California attorney general, has been praised and criticized for her adversarial communication style – and it was one she reportedly employed during her sit-down with Zelenskyy, in attempt to convince him of the imminence of Russia's invasion.

TRUMP MEETS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY AT TRUMP TOWER, SAYS RUSSIA'S WAR MUST END WITH 'FAIR DEAL'

"Look," Harris told him, after some tense back-and-forth, "our teams will share more specific information with you but we are telling you that your numbers are wrong. You really face a potentially imminent invasion."

Rather than softening him, the meeting appeared to put Ukraine's president even more on the defensive.

As Woodward writes, Zelenskyy was hard-pressed to acknowledge the imminence of the invasion despite credible U.S. intelligence, in large part because it would create a "self-fulling prophecy" for Ukraine's nascent democracy, risking the collapse of the country's economy, and potentially, its government.

Finally, Zelenskyy relented, looking Harris in the eye and asking directly, "What do you want me to do?"

He inquired whether the U.S. would impose sanctions, close ports to Russian ships, give Ukraine Stinger or Javelin missiles or send warplanes to his country, in order to equip them for the battles ahead.

Harris’s answer did little to assuage him. "The punishment can only come after the crime," she said of a U.S. response to Russia, Woodward noted, instead advising him to "start thinking about things like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you're captured or killed or cannot govern."

Zelenskyy was urged by the U.S. to have an escape plan – one which he boldly rebuffed, choosing to remain in Kyiv in the days and weeks following Russia’s invasion.

He also turned down evacuation offers from both the U.S. and Turkey following the start of the war.

The "fight is here," he would later say from Kyiv. "I need ammunition, not a ride."

MSNBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki broke down Vice President Kamala Harris’ declining momentum in recent polling ahead of the 2024 election during a Monday segment.

Harris’ reputation among voters dropped to 43% positive in October, a 5-point drop from where she stood in September, Kornacki said. The vice president’s negative rating jumped from 45% in September to 49% in October after she spent the month doing a media blitz with several friendly outlets.

“The shift is here, it’s with Harris, 43% positive, 49% negative,” Kornacki said. “When we took that last poll a month ago, she was actually above water. She had a 48% positive rating and a 45% negative rating. There was a clear advantage for her a month ago on basic image, basic likability, basic perception over Donald Trump. That advantage, in our poll at least, has gone away in a month for her,” Kornacki said.



Republican nominee Donald Trump received a 43% positivity rating and a 51% negativity rating, which Kornacki said was about the usual rating seen for the former president in polling. He noted that the positive rating is a “tick higher” than usual. (RELATED: Steve Kornacki Warns Dems Losing Advantage With Party Registration, Key Voting Bloc In Major Swing State)

The poll shows Trump and Harris are currently tied 48% to 48%, indicating a decline for Harris who previously led 49% to 44% in September, Kornacki said. The previous poll finding Harris in the lead was conducted in the wake of the presidential debate held on Sept. 10.

“Back then, our poll had Harris up by 5, now a tie. Just in terms to refresh people of what happened since we took our last poll, this poll was conducted just in the wake of that Trump-Harris debate, what’s happened since, obviously there’s been a vice presidential debate, there’s been campaign events, Harris has done a number of interviews,” Kornacki said.

The poll found Trump’s retrospective approval rating faring better than President Joe Biden’s by 5 points, indicating that Harris is from an unpopular administration.

“I think Harris is weighted down by being part of an unpopular administration. Joe Biden’s approval rating in our poll sits at 43% and to put this in perspective, we also checked the retrospective job approval rating for Donald Trump, asking voters right now thinking back to Trump’s presidency, do you approve or disapprove of the job he did,” Kornacki said. “A 48% approval rating for Trump retrospectively, notably, that is better than Trump ever did in our poll when he was actually president. So Trump perhaps benefiting from a little bit of a warming of attitudes towards his presidency after the fact and again, that’s 5 points better than Biden’s current approval rating in our poll.”

Harris, who joined the top of the ticket in mid-July, pulled ahead of Trump for several weeks while she refused to participate in a sit-down interview or hold a press conference. Harris’ momentum had seemingly fallen in September and October, leaving the race at a deadlock tie.

Former President Donald Trump holds a three-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in the swing state of Pennsylvania, according to a recent poll.

A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker between October 9-13 found that 50 percent of likely voters in Pennsylvania would vote for Trump in the upcoming presidential election, while 47 percent of likely voters would vote for Harris.

The poll surveyed 1,072 likely voters in the state and had a “margin of sampling error” of +/-3 percentage points.

A previous poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker between September 19-22, 2024, found that Trump and Harris were tied at 48 percent among likely voters in Pennsylvania.

In another poll conducted by InsiderAdvantage, which surveyed 800 likely voters in Pennsylvania between October 7-8, Trump received 49 percent of support, while Harris received 47 percent.

The results of the recent Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker poll come after voter registration data for Pennsylvania revealed that the Republican Party had registered more than 60,710 people to vote during September, surpassing the Democrat party.

During September, the Democrat party registered more than 35,854 people to vote.

While Pennsylvania was crucial in President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election against Trump, recent voter registration has also found that five counties in the state that had previously leaned Democratic had moved to a Republican majority.

Breitbart News’s Wendell Husebo reported that the five counties were, Berks County, Fayette County, Bucks County, Beaver County, and Luzerne County.
The official union of the U.S. Border Patrol announced its endorsement of former President Donald Trump during a rally on Sunday in Arizona.

The National Border Patrol Council, which represents roughly 18,000 Border patrol agents across the country, endorsed Trump during a campaign rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The Border Patrol Union endorsed Trump in 2016 — the first time the union had ever endorsed a presidential candidate — and gave him their nod of approval again in 2020. (RELATED: Biden DHS’ Sudden Crackdown On Migrant Parolees Is Just Another Political ‘Smokescreen,’ Border Hawks Say)

“If we allow Border Czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country, is going to go to hell,” Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Sunday. “The untold millions of people, unvetted, who she has allowed into this country that are committing murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries, and every other crime will continue to put our country in peril.

“Only one man can fix that and that is Donald J. Trump. He has always stood with the men and women who protect this border,” Perez continued. “On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.”

Perez added that Trump was a man who knows what it’s like to put “his life on the line for what is right,” during his endorsement speech, and heavily criticized what the southern border would look like under a potential Harris administration.

The third consecutive endorsement by the Border Patrol union comes as Trump has continued to make immigration enforcement a hallmark of his campaign. The Republican candidate doubled down on this agenda, with a pledge during his Sunday rally to hire an additional 10,000 Border Patrol agents, immediately green-light a 10% raise for agents and offer them a signing bonus.

More than seven million migrants have been apprehended by Border Patrol agents across the U.S.-Mexico border during the Biden-Harris administration, according to latest data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The border crisis that has taken place during the current administration has left Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running neck-and-neck with the former president, with consistently low poll numbers on border issues with voters.

Former Border Patrol leaders who have testified before Congress and spoken to the Daily Caller News Foundation allege that senior members of the Biden-Harris administration actively tried to keep details of the immigration crisis out of sight of the public.

NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitali broke down Republican nominee Donald Trump’s new lead among white women against Vice President Kamala Harris that he has gained in the span of just a few weeks during a Monday segment.

An NBC News poll found Harris holding a six-point advantage against Trump among white women, 51% to 45%, in September, but the former president has since gained ground and took the lead in October, Vitali pointed out on MSNBC’s “Chris Jansing Reports.” Trump is currently leading Harris among the demographic by 2 points, a slightly smaller lead than the one he had against President Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election.

“Among white women in that poll, Trump was of course trailing Harris. But Harris had a nice, healthy plus six margin among these voters,” Vitali said. “Then, you see what a month can do. A month can be an eternity in politics, and it can also mean pretty big changes on polls like this when again, you see white women just over the course of a few weeks shift into the Trump column where there he has a plus two majority with them.”

WATCH:

Trump’s 50% favorability with white women mirrors his support among that demographic in 2016 and 2020, Vitali said. In 2016, 52% of white women backed the former president, and 55% said the same in 2020.

“That kind of puts him in line of where he was in the past, especially when you look at where he was in the past, especially when you look at where he was in 2016 at 52% among white women, then he gains a few points in 2020, up to 55%, and then of course open question about what ends up happening in 2024,” Vitali said.

“But when you see him at 50% in this poll now that we just released over the weekend, Trump is starting to pull in line with where he was in past election cycles, and it’s where you get this really tense and almost confusing dichotomy with white women voters who can swing elections in key states like Pennsylvania but who might feel like their ideology is more in line with Democrats, at least according to our polling averages we’ve seen over time,” Vitali continued.

In 2020, Trump led Biden among white women in Pennsylvania at 52% to 47%, while Biden secured a lead among all women at 55% to 44%, according to NBC News exit polling from 2020.

MSNBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki pointed out Monday that Harris’ favorability among voters dropped from 48% in September to 43% currently, while her negative rating rose from 45% to 49%. The vice president led Trump 49% to 44% in September, but that lead has diminished to a deadlock tie of 48% to 48% in October.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ senior campaign advisor David Plouffe said Sunday the Democratic Party’s panic over the close race with former President Donald Trump is a result of polling that showed a false lead.

Pollsters and pundits have warned about the tightening polls as November approaches, with reports claiming people within the party are growing “nervous,” according to CNN. Co-host Dan Pfeiffer asked Plouffe on “Pod Save America” if he was concerned about the race and whether it had “changed” in recent weeks, to which Plouffe responded that Harris has consistently been tied with Trump in the polls.

“So I know for all of us that want to see Kamala Harris win, we wish there was an easy pathway — that pathway does not exist. This is basically going to come down to, you know, history would suggest it’s not going to come down to several thousand votes in seven states, but it’s going to come down to a very narrow margin,” Plouffe said.

“I think the freakout is because there were a bunch of polls, I’d say in the last month, that showed a lead for Kamala Harris that was not real. It’s not what we were seeing — we’ve seen this thing basically be tied let’s say since mid-September,” Plouffe added. “This is the race we have, it’s the race we expected. I don’t think it’s going to open up for either candidate, I think it’s going to be close all the way in. I would just remind everybody, whether it’s internal data or public data, a poll that shows Donald Trump up 48, 47 that then shows us up 48, 47 is essentially the same thing. This thing’s going to be decided on the margins in these few number of states.”

Plouffe previously stated he believes Trump and Harris will remain tied until Election Day, but warned that Trump appears strong in this race. (RELATED: ‘Plagiarism Hunter’ Finds More Than A Dozen Lifted Passages In Book Harris Co-Authored)

WATCH:

“I think from the time Kamala Harris became the nominee we saw a lot of movement — five, six points depending on the state. But what we’ve seen for the last few weeks, and the data is consistent this week, is basically a tied race in seven states and I don’t think that’s going to change. So I think it’s 47, 48 for each of us. I’d still rather be Kamala Harris than Donald Trump because I think she’s got a slightly higher ceiling,” Plouffe said. “But the reality is Donald Trump barely won in [20]16, but barely lost in 20[20]. He’s a little stronger this time than he was last time, so he’s going to get 48% of the vote.”

Harris’ support among Hispanic and black voters has slipped in recent weeks compared to previous Democratic presidential candidates. A New York Times poll shows Harris trailing by six points among Hispanic voters compared to President Joe Biden’s 2020 numbers.

Trump has also gained ground with black voters, receiving 15% support, up from 9% in 2020, according to the same poll.

NBC News’ latest national poll, released Sunday, shows the two candidates deadlocked at 48% support, just three weeks from Election Day. RealClearPolling averages also show Trump with a narrow lead in swing states Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, while Harris only holds a slim lead in Wisconsin.

CNN host Kate Bolduan pressed Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler Monday on whether sexism is playing into Vice President Kamala Harris’ struggling support with black men.

Former President Barack Obama suggested at a Thursday rally in Pennsylvania that Harris may be lagging with black men due to sexism. Tyler said Obama pointed out the “stark choice” between Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump, leading Bolduan to repeatedly ask about whether Harris’ gender plays into her lagging support.

“He was definitely talking about stark choice, but very clearly he was suggesting, Michael … he says ‘part of it makes me think that well, you weren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, so you’re thinking of either sitting out or even supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you have a sign of strength because that’s what a man is, putting women down, that’s not acceptable.’ It’s very clear that he’s suggesting that sexism is at play for why some black men he’s concerned aren’t going to turn out,” Bolduan said, quoting Obama.

“Yeah, and he was also very clear that there’s one candidate in this race who actually has the interest of black men at heart, and that’s Vice President Harris. He’s also equally clear that black men who are capable of exercising our power to decide the fate of this election. Black men are going to do that and they’re going to do that on behalf of the vice president because this campaign is going to make sure that black men understand what’s at stake, the campaign is gonna make sure that black men understand there’s a candidate in Vice President Kamala Harris who’s actually fighting for them,” Tyler said.

WATCH:

Tyler accused Trump of “denigrating” black men throughout his career, arguing that the campaign would reach out and win with black, male voters. Bolduan, not appearing satisfied with the answer, pressed once again on whether the campaign agrees with Obama’s accusations about sexism. (RELATED: ‘Woah’: CNN’s Harry Enten Stunned By ‘Tremendous Drop’ In Young Black Male Support For Dems)

“No, what we are focused on, what the campaign understands is that for too long, too many black men have felt as though candidates running for office have centered our concerns, have centered our anxieties, and centered our dreams and our aspirations. And the vice president, long before she was a candidate, that’s exactly what she has done. So we’re bringing that to this campaign down the stretch and make sure that black men understand that there’s gonna be somebody who will be thinking about them when she sits behind the resolute desk,” Tyler said.

The percentage of black men favoring Republicans surged from 7% in 2016 to 15% in 2024, a worrying sign for Democrats from the traditionally reliable voting bloc, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday.

A CNN/SSRS poll from September 26 found that Harris holds a 55-point lead among black voters under the age of 60, which lags behind President Joe Biden’s 71-point lead among the same demographic in 2020. Trump has been improving among black voters, particularly with those under the age of 40.

Vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance blasted ABC’s Martha Raddatz on Sunday after she tried defending the invasion at the southern border that has led to violent gangs taking over entire apartment complexes.

Former President Donald Trump vowed Friday during a rally in Aurora, Colorado, to launch “Operation Aurora” to remove members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which has taken over apartment complexes in the state. Republican Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman released a statement shortly after Trump’s rally saying that the city has not been “taken over” by “migrant gangs” before acknowledging “incidents” at “a handful of specific apartment complexes.”

During Sunday’s episode of ABC’s “This Week,” Raddatz tried to defend the violent gang invasion after Vance noted that Coffman’s statement was nonetheless an acknowledgment of an issue to some degree.

“Sen. Vance, I’m going to stop you because I know exactly what happened,” Raddatz said. “I’m going to stop you. The incidents were limited to a handful of apartment complexes — apartment complexes — and the mayor said ‘our dedicated police officers have acted on those concerns.’ A handful of problems.”

“Only? Martha, do you hear yourself?” Vance fired back. “Only a handful of apartment complexes in America were taken over by Venezuelan gangs, and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris’ open border? Americans are so fed up with what’s going on and they have every right to be, and I really find this exchange, Martha, sort of interesting because you seem to be more focused with nitpicking everything that Donald Trump has said rather than acknowledging that apartment complexes in the United States of America are being taken over by violent gangs.”

“I worry so much more about that problem than anything else here,” Vance continued. “We’ve got to get American communities in a safe space again. And unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don’t know who they really are, you’re going to have problems like this. Kamala Harris, 94 executive orders that undid Donald Trump’s successful border policies, we knew this stuff would happen.”

RADDATZ: Only a handful of apartment complexes were overtaken by Venezuelan gangs

“That’s —” Raddatz tried to interject.

“They bragged about opening the border and now we have the consequences and we’re living with it,” Vance continued. “We can do so much better, but frankly, we’re not going to do better, Martha, unless Donald Trump calls this stuff out. I’m glad that he did.”

“Okay. Let’s, let’s just, let’s just end that with they did not invade or take over the city as Donald Trump said. I want to move on to just —” Raddatz said.

“A few apartment complexes, no big deal,” Vance sarcastically shot back.

Notably, despite Coffman and Raddatz pretending that the issue isn’t that serious because it’s “only” a few apartment complexes, the city nonetheless launched an entire task force dedicated to combatting Tren de Aragua.

The New York Post reports that “members of the violent Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua … have been using various dilapidated apartment complexes … as their home base” in Aurora, noting the city has identified at least 10 suspected members of Tren de Aragua in the city. Cbz Management, which manages apartment complexes in Colorado including The Edge at Lowry where illegal migrants have taken over, further took to X to “set the record straight” after “some have spread false information” about the situation “in an attempt to discredit this fact for political purposes and avoid governmental accountability.”

Cbz Management explained it began managing “buildings” in 2019 and during its long renovation process, illegal immigrants began “exploiting squatter laws” and that crime was on the rise.

After Vance made a fool out of Raddatz, ABC News continued seething, with the outlet’s Hannah Demissie providing additional propaganda with an article entitled: “Vance stands by Trump’s false claims about Venezuelan gangs in Aurora, Colorado.”

Three men were arrested and charged in September after a video showing armed men breaking into an apartment went viral, according to the Post. While local cops claimed none of the men were affiliated with the gang — you know, the same cops that Coffman and Raddatz said were handling the situation — federal law enforcement sources confirmed to The Post that at least one of the men “admitted that he’s a member of the violence Venezuelan gang …”

The other two suspects “crossed the border illegally last year and were quickly released into the US,” The Post reported, citing anonymous sources. The Post noted there “is no confirmed evidence” that the two suspects are members of Tren de Aragua.

But it doesn’t even matter whether these two men are affiliated with Tren de Aragua. What matters is that the Biden-Harris let violent criminals into the country who are now not only endangering Americans, but forcing taxpayers to cough up extra just so they can be safe from people who shouldn’t be here in the first place.

The Biden-Harris Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Friday alleging that Virginia’s removal of noncitizens and other ineligible registrants from its voter rolls is illegal.

“The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and the Justice Department will continue to ensure that the rights of qualified voters are protected,” Kristen Clarke, the hyper-partisan head of the agency’s Civil Rights Division, contended in a melodramatic statement.

The suit comes in response to efforts by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the Virginia Department of Elections (ELECT) to ensure only eligible U.S. citizens are on the state’s voter registration lists.

In an August executive order directing commonwealth agencies to undertake election security efforts ahead of the November election, Youngkin revealed that ELECT had removed 6,303 noncitizens from Virginia’s voter rolls from January 2022 to July 2024. The directive also included instructions for ensuring accuracy within the state voter rolls.

In its lawsuit, the DOJ — which has regularly been weaponized to target Republican-led election integrity efforts since Joe Biden became president — alleged that the state’s removal of foreign nationals from its voter registration lists violated the “Quiet Period Provision” of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. That law requires states to complete “not later than 90 days prior to the date of a primary or general election for Federal office, any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.”

The Justice Department claimed that the processes laid out in Youngkin’s executive order constitute such a “program” in violation of the NVRA’s Quiet Period Provision. The agency further contended this provision “applies to systemic programs intended to remove the names of ineligible voters based on failure to meet initial eligibility requirements—including citizenship — at the time of registration.”

“The Quiet Period Provision embodies Congress’s clear and considered judgment to restrict states from engaging in systematic processes aimed at removing the names of ineligible voters from the rolls in the final days before an election,” the lawsuit reads. “And for good reason: systematic removal programs are more error-prone than other forms of list maintenance, and eligible voters placed on the path to removal days or weeks before Election Day may be deterred from voting or unable to participate in the election on the same terms that they would have but for the Commonwealth’s error.”

“The Commonwealth’s unlawful actions here have likely confused, deterred, and removed U.S. citizens who are fully eligible to vote — the very scenario that Congress tried to prevent when it enacted the Quiet Period Provision,” it added.

[RELATED: Biden’s DOJ Threatens Election Offices: Cleaning Voter Rolls May Be ‘Discriminatory’]

In a Friday statement responding to the DOJ’s lawfare, Youngkin noted that the Biden-Harris administration is suing the commonwealth for “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law signed by Democrat Tim Kaine that requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls — a process that starts with someone declaring themselves a non-citizen and then registering to vote.”

“Virginians — and Americans — will see this for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth, the very crucible of American Democracy,” the governor said. “With the support of our Attorney General, we will defend these commonsense steps, that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us. Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”

The DOJ has asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Alexandria Division to declare the commonwealth in violation of the NVRA’s Quiet Period Provision and require Virginia and state election officials to “halt” its efforts to ensure clean voter rolls until after the November contest. The agency also requested the court to force Virginia to “restore to the voter rolls those U.S. citizens whose registration was cancelled” as a result of Youngkin’s order and provide notice to “affected U.S. citizens that they have been restored to the voter rolls.”

With just over three weeks to go until Election Day, a trio of new national polls in the White House race suggest former President Donald Trump is erasing gains made by Vice President Kamala Harris the last couple of months after replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

The surveys indicate a margin of error race between the two major party presidential nominees, with Trump enjoying some momentum in the final stretch.

Harris edged Trump 50%-48% among likely voters questioned in an ABC News/Ipsos poll, down from a six-point lead for the vice president last month.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

According to an NBC News poll of registered voters nationwide, the vice president and former president were deadlocked at 48%. That is a major switch from a month ago, when Harris enjoyed a five-point advantage.

Additionally, a CBS News/YouGov nonprobability based survey of likely voters indicated Harris with a three-point edge over Trump, slightly down from a four-point advantage a month ago.

After President Biden's disastrous late June debate performance against Trump, the former president started to open up a single-digit lead over the White House incumbent.

However, Biden's departure from the presidential election and the Democrats' quick consolidation around the vice president upended the dynamics of the race.

Harris, boosted by a wave of energy and excitement, experienced a surge in fundraising and in her favorable ratings, which pushed her past Trump in presidential polling. The trend continued through the Democrats' late August convention and the first and likely only debate between the two standard-bearers, in early September.

However, as summer transitioned into autumn, Harris' favorable ratings appear to have waned, Republicans are coming home to Trump, and an already large gender gap over support for the two nominees has widened further.

HARRIS MAKES NEW PITCH FOR BLACK MALES AMID POLLING GAINS BY TRUMP

"The Harris campaign seems to have stalled, as her image has slipped and the perception of her as being ‘a second Biden Administration’ persists," longtime Republican pollster Neil Newhouse told Fox News.

Newhouse, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, argued that Harris is "on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory."

While national polling is useful in depicting the state of the race, the presidential election is not based on the popular national vote and instead is a battle for the states and their electoral votes.

The latest polling in the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine who wins the 2024 election also points to a margin of error race.

A leading non-partisan pollster said the jury's still out on whether Trump's gaining momentum.

"We need more data points before we can depict poll movements as momentum," Suffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos told Fox News.

Paleologos, who conducts USA Today/Suffolk University polling, said "it could be momentum, or it could be the natural closing of the gap in a very polarized country."
Former President Bill Clinton said in a speech Sunday that Georgia nursing student Laken Riley's murder would not have happened if the alleged killer, an illegal immigrant, was properly vetted.

While campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris in the Peach State, Clinton accused her rival, former President Trump, of tanking negotiations over a bipartisan border compromise in Congress because he wanted it to be a campaign issue.

He seemed to suggest that Riley's death could have been avoided if Congress was able to pass a compromise – despite the alleged killer having already been vetted.

"She's the only candidate who has actually endorsed a bill that would hold down immigration any given year to a certain point and then made sure we gave people a decent place to live, didn't divide people from their children. And we did total vetting before people got in. Now, Trump killed the bill," Clinton said.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

"You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about it, a young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened."

"And America isn't having enough babies to keep our populations up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work – there wouldn't be a problem," he added.

Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), meanwhile, previously publicly confirmed that people who are encountered trying to cross the border illegally are vetted and screened.

The alleged killer was encountered by CBP on Sept. 8, 2022, after entering near El Paso, Texas, and was "paroled and released for further processing.," Fox News Digital was previously told.

The bipartisan border deal also only failed earlier this year, years after the Venezuelan national accused of killing Riley entered the country, still under the Biden administration's watch.

Clinton later praised the current administration’s handling of the border and illegal immigration during a campaign stop in Georgia on Monday.

"For the last three years, the Biden-Harris administration has done increasingly tough things, trying to control the border. And illegal crossings have gone down every year for three years. Our friends in the other party don't want to talk about that," Clinton said.

TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE

It is notable that the former president’s speech largely focused on the border in Georgia, a state President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.

The issue of illegal crossings at the border has become a political lightening rod in this election cycle. Democrats in tight races – both for the presidency and congressional and local positions – are emphasizing their support for tougher border security measures as Americans across the country have seen their area infrastructures strained by a deluge of people seeking shelter in the U.S.

However, Republicans have long criticized Democrats’ handling of border security, citing the record number of border crossings since Biden took office. They have continued to do so during the campaign by arguing Harris has failed to live up to her informal "border czar" title.

Despite several instances of high-profile use in the media, Clinton accused Republicans of bestowing the title on Harris – which he dismissed as inaccurate.

"They want to attack Kamala Harris and blame her for anything they managed to keep from happening. Like they claim she was the ‘border czar,’ that's not what her jobs are," Clinton said.

"Her job was to go down to these other countries that were sending us a lot of people and trying to get them, to enroll them in a legal process while they were still in the country so they wouldn't be illegally trafficked, show up our border, had to be cared for on one side of it or another, and then we'd run the risk of having people get in here who weren't properly vetted. That's what she tried to do."

He also accused former President Trump of working to derail the bipartisan border compromise that failed in the Senate, and which House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., deemed "dead on arrival" in the House.

"He said, ‘Oh my God, we can't fix the border. What am I going to do for TV ads? Who am I going to demonize every day? I don't get into politics to solve problems. I get in it to create problems and blame other people for doing,’" Clinton said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for a response.

The former president is on a campaign swing through rural America on behalf of Harris' 2024 bid.
Here is something that no one in the media is reporting as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to duck and weave like Muhammad Ali in the ring to avoid any questions about her economic plan.

Under the Harris tax plan, the number of Americans subject to the hated death tax would significantly increase. This would happen because Harris has declared that she will let the Trump tax cut expire next year if she becomes president.

Thanks to the Trump tax cut, the amount of an estate that is currently exempt from tax is roughly $13.6 million.

But according to the Internal Revenue Service: “Under the tax reform law, the increase is only temporary. Thus, in 2026, the exemption is due to revert to its pre-2018 level of $5 million, as adjusted for inflation.”

Harris wants this to happen. She wants to soak the millionaires and billionaires. But under her plan, thousands more families will be clobbered by this tax when a parent dies.

We aren’t talking about the very rich — people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who are already subject to the unfair death tax. (Though these super billionaires have built massive family-foundation tax shelters to escape the tax.)

Now many farms, ranches and family-owned businesses will have to be sold after a funeral just to pay the taxes. These are mostly owners and operators of small businesses that have been built up over a lifetime from nothing to million-dollar-plus enterprises. The owners have already paid Uncle Sam millions of dollars in income, property, payroll, energy, business and other taxes and annual levies.

Now, they will have to pay a 40% estate tax rate, plus another 5% to 15% depending on what state they die in. In other words, up to half of a family inheritance must be forked over to the politicians. The IRS gets almost as much as the kids and grandkids. The agents should at least pay their respects at the funeral!

How is that fair?

But wait. It gets worse.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has introduced a bill to make the death tax even more onerous. Under her bill, the estate tax rate would rise to as high as 55% to 65% and lower the exempt about to $3.5 million. This means that as much as two-thirds of an estate could be seized by the government. This isn’t taxation. It’s confiscation of family property. Is the IRS going to seize grandmas jewelry of grandpas stable of horses and the mansion he built himself?

Will family businesses have to undergo the indignity of a fire sale to vulture companies just to pay the taxes owed?

Guess who is a supporter of the Elizabeth Warren tax scheme? Yes, Kamala Harris thinks this is a swell idea.

Incredibly, if the Warren tax came to pass, the United States — the land of the free — would have the highest estate tax in the world.

Higher than Russia. Higher than China. Higher than the socialist nations of Europe.

The real-world impact of death taxes this high is that older people will avoid the death tax by lavishly spending down the family estate so that there is no money left to tax. The incentive is to die broke. Family businesses won’t be able to pass from one generation to the next. This is how the death tax destroys jobs and investment.

The chart below shows the U.S. already has one of the highest death taxes in the world and we would be the highest in the world under the Warren-Harris bill.

By contrast, Trump will make his death tax relief permanent. Family businesses and estates will remain vibrantly intact.

This is one of many vital tax issues voters should consider on Election Day.

It’s pretty clear which states to watch to know whether Democrats or Republicans will control the Senate. Contests in Ohio, Montana, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are all battlegrounds. But it’s a different story to understanding which might control the House.

The path to power isn’t direct in the House.

A patchwork of districts – hopscotching from northern Maine to the tundra of Alaska – might decide the House majority.

So on election night, let me decode the signs to interpret which party may serve in the House majority in 2025.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN SEPTEMBER

It’s about the math.

Let’s begin with the current breakdown in the House.

There are presently 432 House members. 220 Republicans and 212 Democrats. There are three vacancies.

Late Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., and Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., died. Former Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., resigned. None of these are swing districts. So, if the House were at full membership with 435 seats, the breakdown would be 221 Republicans to 214 Democrats. The margin is seven. But Democrats only need a net gain of four seats to capture control. Also, note that some districts have morphed – especially in North Carolina – due to redistricting. In fact, Republicans could gain several seats there alone.

So here’s the charge for Democrats: hold seats they currently have – and pluck off a handful of seats as they skip around the map. Also, make up the difference from what they will likely lose in the Tar Heel State. This is not a comprehensive list. But it will provide a general feel for the evening.

Here’s an early race to watch which could give a you a clue as to the direction of the House: Maine’s 2nd District.

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, faces Republican challenger and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault. This is a massive, rugged, rural district which stretches north to the Canadian border. Golden is one of the most moderate – and vulnerable Democrats in the House. Former President Trump won the singular electoral vote by carrying this district in 2020. Maine employs a proportional system to divide its electoral votes.

If Golden holds this seat, that could serve as an early canary in the coal mine indicating that Democrats are in good shape. But if Theriault prevails, that might signal the House could drift the other direction.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN HINTS AT ELECTION DAY TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR VOTERS IMPACTED BY HURRICANES HELENE, MILTON

Political analysts believe that Democrats lost the House in New York in 2022. That’s ironic because the former chairman of the Democrats reelection efforts two years ago, former Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., hailed from New York. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is from Brooklyn. That’s to say nothing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Empire State Democrats have an opportunity to make significant inroads if they perform well in House races this year. The fact that it’s a presidential election could also bolster Democratic performance in New York. Democrats already won back the seat occupied by former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., - who was expelled. But Democrats are angling to defeat freshman Reps. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y., Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. A clean sweep in the early returns sends a message that Democrats are performing substantially well on the evening of November 5. Democrats will be disappointed if they don’t capture at least three of these seats.

Virginia is also a place where both parties have pickup opportunities. A sweep by either side could reveal the overall direction of the night.

Freshman Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal in the Tidewater area. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., is retiring to run for governor next year. Democrat Eugene Vindman faces Republican Derrick Anderson to succeed Spanberger. The parties could split these races, making Virginia a wash.

Veteran Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio and freshman Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, are both defending battleground districts in a state which should go overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. The fact that Republican Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, hails from the Buckeye State could influence voter turnout. It’s a boon if Republicans are able to topple either Kaptur or Sykes. And Republicans could be looking at a grand slam if both Democrats lose. However, Kaptur is the longest-tenured woman in House history. Republicans have been trying to defeat her for years. It’s far from clear that they can do so this year.

Democrats also have a shot at winning a redrawn seat in Alabama. A federal court decided that Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act by packing Black voters into a single majority Black district. The court ruled that Alabama must retool its Congressional maps, making what was once a Republican district into one favoring Democrats. Shomari Figures hopes to capture that district for the Democrats.

In Iowa, Democrats are eyeing two seats – although winning either may be a stretch. One seat pits Democrat Lanon Baccam against Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa. Democrats also hope Christina Bohannan can unseat sophomore Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa. Miller-Meeks squeaked out a victory in 2020 by just six votes. But Miller-Meeks won by seven points in 2022. Democrats would be fortunate to knock off either Nunn or Miller-Meeks. But they definitely believe Bohannan has a bona fide shot at toppling Miller-Meeks.

In Colorado, Rep. Yadira Caraveo D-Colo., won her first term by about 2,000 votes. She’s up against Republican challenger Gabe Evans. But it’s believed a strong showing at the top of the ticket in blue Colorado could help Caraveo.

TRUMP ALLY TIM SCOTT MULLS BID FOR TOP ROLE AT SENATE CAMPAIGN ARM

In New Mexico, Freshman Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M. is in a rematch with former Rep. Yvette Harrell, R-N.M. This district is one of the swingiest in the country and bears watching. Former Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M., flipped this district in 2018 after former Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., ran for governor. Harrell then defeated Torres Small in 2020. However, Vasquez flipped the district back to the Democrats in 2022. Harrell hopes to return the favor this fall.

Besides New York, California is where Democrats also hope to make up significant ground. It doesn’t hurt that the Democratic nominee for President used to represent the Golden State in the Senate and served as its attorney general. Moreover, a Senate race could boost Democratic turnout. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is running against former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres star Steve Garvey.

Democrats hope to unseat Reps. John Duarte, R-Calif., David Valadao, R-Calif., Mike Garcia, R-Calif., Ken Calvert, R-Calif., and Michelle Steel, R-Calif. They each represent battleground districts. Duarte won his race in an upset last cycle by fewer than 600 votes. Democrats unseated Valadao in 2018. But he returned to Congress in 2020.

Also, three other races could indicate whether it’s a Democratic or Republican night.

In Oregon, Freshman Rep. Lori Chavez-Deremer, R-Ore., runs against Democrat Janelle Bynum. Bynum has defeated Chavez-Deremer in previous contests for the statehouse. If Chavez-Deremer holds on, that could flash as a positive sign for the GOP.

Meantime, Freshman Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., was the biggest upset of the last election cycle. She eked out a victory over Republican Joe Kent by about 2,000 votes. Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent face off again. The district was Republican prior to last cycle. But it’s believed Kent veered too far toward the right, courting former President Trump and pro-MAGA forces. This race could be a bellwether to distill just how well the MAGA message resonates.

Finally, control of the House could hinge on Alaska.

Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won this at-large seat after Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska died in 2022. Young represented the state in the House for nearly half a century. However, Peltola has never been on the ballot at the same time as former President Trump. Mr. Trump defeated President Biden by ten points here in 2020.

If Peltola prevails, that victory on solid GOP turf could go a long way toward Democrats flipping the House.

But, because so many of these races might be tight, it may be impossible to divine which party controls the House for a while. Two years ago, it took until mid-November.
NBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki said that some polling numbers for Vice President Kamala Harris have "completely reversed" in recent days.

Harris was once touted by many of her supporters as the inevitable winner of the 2024 election, but with less than a month before the election, the race appears to be a dead heat. NBC "Today" host Savannah Guthrie discussed how recent polling shows the race "deadlocked."

Guthrie then did a deep dive on the numbers with Kornacki and said, "I mean, the top line is the 5-point advantage that Kamala Harris had in our last poll is gone. What’s behind that shift?"

TRUMP TAKES LEAD IN 6 OUT OF 7 BATTLEGROUND STATES IN RECENT POLLING

Kornacki agreed, contrasting previous polling that took place after the first Trump-Harris debate versus now, amid Harris' media blitz. The polling showed Trump had risen from 44% to 48%, whereas Harris had declined from 49% to 48%.

In one noteworthy poll, however, Harris had declined significantly, as Kornacki noted "some things that have changed in that time. I think this might be the biggest for Harris."

"We just asked the basic image perception people have, is it positive or negative of these candidates? The Trump number’s always been somewhere in this territory," he said as he gestured at Trump having a 43% positive and 51% negative rating. "In fact, this is a little bit high for him, believe it or not."

IF 2024 POLLING ERRORS MIRROR THOSE IN 2020 ELECTION, TRUMP ‘WINS IN A BLOWOUT’, WARNS CNN DATA GURU

But he said that Harris’ numbers have notably changed.

"But look at Harris, 43 positive, 49 negative. The significance, we polled this a month ago. She was 48% positive and 45 negative. She was above water, as they say. That’s completely reversed. It now looks very similar to Trump’s. That’s a pretty big shift when you’re talking about a race this close," he added.

He then noted further polling indicating that only a quarter of families say Biden-era policies are helping their family, whereas 45% say they are "hurting" them.

"And then here’s the interesting twist. We also asked folks, ‘Think back to when Donald Trump was president. Did his policies help or hurt your family?’ And look at the difference, 44% helping, 31 hurting. Trump’s — the retrospective, you would say, opinion of Trump’s presidency among voters, arguably higher now than when he was president," Kornacki said.
The Harris campaign will allow Vice President Kamala Harris to sit for a Wednesday interview on Fox News.

Harris’s scheduled appearance on Fox News reeks of desperation, critics say, as she appears to be limping into the final three weeks of the presidential campaign.

Polling shows Harris is losing support among men, black voters, and Hispanic voters, while former President Donald Trump is running ahead of his 2020 and 2016 performances. Swing state polling indicates Trump is either leading Harris or within the margin of error. Voter registrations and early voting also appear to benefit Trump in many states.

Harris agreed to an interview with anchor Bret Baier in Pennsylvania. The interview will air Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.

Harris will be the first Democrat candidate to appear on the network since two-time failed presidential candidate and election denier Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The New York Times reported the campaign’s interview decision:

Ms. Harris will have a chance to deliver her message to a viewership that may be skeptical of her candidacy. Her willingness to appear on Fox News may aid the perception that she is open to facing tough questions. And she can reach a swath of independent voters, more of whom watch Fox News than CNN or MSNBC, according to research by Nielsen.
Vice President Kamala Harris argued this weekend that former President Donald Trump is "hiding" from the American people and attempted to goad him into releasing updated records about his health after she did so herself on Saturday.

"Donald Trump refuses to release his medical records, and he is unwilling to meet for a second debate," Harris said Sunday. "Why does his staff want him to hide away? Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?"

On Saturday, Harris' physician released a two-page "Healthcare Statement," which insisted that "in summary," Harris "remains in excellent health." The statement from Harris' doctor also indicated she had her most recent annual physical exam in April of this year. Trump released his own health records while campaigning in 2016, and once he took over the White House he continued the trend. In August, with the 2024 election quickly approaching, Trump told CBS News that he would release updated medical records to the public. However, he has yet to do so, with roughly three weeks until Election Day.

WHITE HOUSE RELEASES MEDICAL REPORT ON VP KAMALA HARRIS

"He won't put out his medical records," Harris insisted Monday morning during an interview with podcast host Roland Martin. She also slammed Trump for refusing to debate a second time and questioned why Trump's "staff" would not allow him to do an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes," particularly when it is tradition for both presidential candidates to do a sit down with the show.

"It may be because they think he's just not ready and unfit and unstable and should not have that level of transparency for the American people," Harris suggested.

The Trump campaign shot back against Harris' accusations, pointing out the former president has already released voluntary updates about his health. They also noted that he shared records from a July screening conducted by Dr. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician turned GOP congressman, following the second assassination attempt on his life.

TRUMP'S FORMER DOCTOR GIVES HEALTH UPDATE, CALLS OUT WRAY AS FBI AFFIRMS BULLET STRUCK FORMER PRESIDENT

"All have concluded [Trump] is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. "He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history." Meanwhile, Cheung slammed Harris as being "unable to keep up with demands of campaigning," arguing that compared to Trump her schedule "is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump."

On Sunday, during a rally in Arizona, Trump himself discussed his health and argued critics look for any reason to say he is not cognitively or physically fit to be president.

"If I pronounce the word slightly wrong … I speak for hours, mostly without a teleprompter … one mispronunciation of a word: 'He's cognitively impaired. He's getting old. He mispronounced a word like the name of the gang.'"

"But they love it, you know, because Biden was obviously cognitively repaired," Trump added at the rally. "[Harris] should have reported him because that puts our nation in danger."

Before President Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, similar demands for his medical records were made. The medical records never came, but details from an exam of the president, which determined he had been exhibiting signs of Parkinsons Disease, eventually surfaced just days before Biden ended his run for president.

WHITE HOUSE CORRECTS RECORD ON BIDEN'S PHYSICIAN, PARKINSON'S EXPERT MEETING, SAYS IT WAS FOR PRESIDENT'S CARE

During his presidency, Biden's personal doctor released at least three separate reports updating the American public on his health. Trump, similarly, produced at least three different health records while he was serving as president.

On Sunday morning's episode of NBC's "Meet The Press," House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., was pressed by host Kristen Welker about whether he thought seeing detailed information about Trump's health, such as his cholesterol level, was important.

"Kristen, the American people don’t care about the cholesterol level of Donald Trump. They care about the cost of living and the fact they cannot pay for groceries because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s policies have put them in that situation. The medical records are irrelevant," Johnson responded. "Let’s talk about things that the American people care about. That’s why Donald Trump is surging in the polls because he’s doing that on stages, in interviews, nonstop around the clock. And Kamala Harris has done nothing."

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment but did not receive a response by press time.
Hunter Biden’s scandalous laptop - falsely dismissed as Russian disinformation – became part of the American lexicon four years ago today, on October 14, 2020, kicking off a years-long scandal with big tech, corporate media and the intelligence community.

"I think that virtually every single mainstream outlet disgraced themselves," former New York Post deputy politics editor Emma-Jo Morris told Fox News Digital.

While at the New York Post, Morris first reported on Hunter Biden’s personal computer, which eventually was dubbed the "laptop from hell" by the paper’s staffers. The infamous laptop was filled with shocking videos and photos of drug use, lewd sex acts, and sensitive business communications. It was exposed by the Post only a few weeks before then-candidate Joe Biden was set to square off against then-President Trump.

In an unprecedented act of uniformed censorship, the bombshell Post report was essentially buried by Big Tech and the mainstream press, silencing an "October surprise" that many feel could have swung the election.

HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP RE-EMERGES AS MEDIA EMBARRASSMENT AS IT BECOMES KEY EVIDENCE AT GUN TRIAL

Twitter, claiming the story violated its terms of service on hacked materials, locked the New York Post out of its account for weeks and even blocked users from sharing the story link. MSNBC, CNN, CBS, NPR, Washington Post, The New York Times and a variety of other outlets and social media platforms either pushed the since-debunked "Russian disinformation" narrative or ignored the story altogether.

Morris, who had the lead byline on the initial bombshell report, feels the "multiple scandals" that erupted following her story forever changed the trajectory of tech and media in America.

"It definitely did change… the trajectory of the tech history because first of all, obviously, the most glaring example is that… the trust on Twitter was completely collapsed… it led Elon Musk to buy the platform," Morris said.

"Now that he has acquired Twitter, it's completely changed the ability for censors to operate because he is just not playing ball with them," she continued. "And Twitter is obviously, which was why this was so scandalous during the time of laptop censorship, Twitter is the main feeder for the rest of media."

FLASHBACK: MSNBC, CNN, CBS TOLD VIEWERS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION

The Russian disinformation narrative stemmed in part from an open letter penned by 51 former intel officials, several of whom endorsed Joe Biden for president that year, who declared that the laptop had "all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation." The open letter quickly went viral and was parroted by Biden supporters, including his then-future White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who is now an MSNBC host.

"These people took the word of spies and completely misled the American public, either wittingly or unwittingly. I'm not sure which one is worse," Morris said.

Biden was quick to cite the letter during a 2020 presidential debate when he called claims the laptop was authentic "a bunch of garbage" and only believed by then-President Trump and his allies.

Morris says she got into journalism to help Americans have "some sort of check on power and on tyranny," but the laptop censorship made her realize something critical. She noted the scandal was eye-opening because she realized corporate America has so much clout that tech and media companies were approached by the intelligence community to do their bidding.

"Who was the central focal point of the corruption here? It was corporations. It was Big Tech and corporate media," Morris said.

CNN BOSS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR SPIKED HUNTER BIDEN CONTROVERSY, AUDIOTAPES REVEAL: 'WE'RE NOT GOING WITH' STORY

Morris, now a senior consultant for Beck & Stone, feels there was never real accountability for the people who pushed the bogus narrative that the "laptop from hell" was Russian disinformation even though people following the saga "learned so much" through investigations by journalists and Congress.

"The real sin in all of this was the collaboration between social media, legacy media and the intelligence community," Morris said.

"Nobody apologized, and I don't mean apologized… to their readers and their listeners," Morris continued. "Not a single one."

Morris’ initial Post story centered on a 2015 email from a Ukrainian energy executive to Hunter Biden, thanking him for introducing him to his father, that it had obtained from the hard drive of the laptop. Joe Biden was vice president at the time of the message, and his son then enjoyed a lucrative position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, raising concerns of an attempted influence-peddling scheme.

The laptop, which was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 by its owner and never recovered, was absolutely authentic and has since been not only confirmed by the FBI, but also by the media that previously insisted it was Russian disinformation.

Morris feels The New York Times was the most egregious of the corporate media bad actors, because the Gray Lady dismissed it as "Russian disinformation" until subtly confirming it years later as a throwaway line buried deep in a story about Hunter Biden's taxes.

HUNTER BIDEN SAGA: WASHINGTON POST AUTHENTICATES LAPTOP AFTER DISMISSING ‘FAKE’ SCANDAL IN 2020

Others believe NPR was the most ridiculous, as its managing editor insisted, "We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions," when declaring the taxpayer-funded outlet wouldn't cover the laptop.

Media Research Center executive editor Tim Graham believes the laptop ordeal offered unwavering proof that the media is largely partisan.

"Everything that's happened since the last election - the timid admission from some newspapers and networks in 2022 that the laptop was real, and the extremely slow and feckless federal prosecution of Hunter - only underline that the media values being reliable to the Democrats ahead of being reliable to the public," Graham told Fox News Digital.

"The legacy media don't believe in holding Democrats accountable. Incuriosity is their most shameful trait," he continued. "They heard of someone who was reserving a share of Hunter's Chinese millions for the ‘Big Guy,’ and didn't want to know if the president was the ‘Big Guy.’"

FROM 'SMEAR CAMPAIGN' TO 'RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,' LIBERAL MEDIA TEAMED UP TO DISMISS HUNTER BIDEN STORY

In one of the most memorable media moments regarding the bombshell story, Trump appeared on CBS’ "60 Minutes" shortly after the story emerged and called the laptop "one of the biggest scandals" he had ever seen. But interviewer Lesley Stahl was insistent that there was no way to conclude the laptop, or its contents, were real.

Stahl’s employer, CBS News, confirmed in 2022 via its own forensic investigation that the laptop and its contents were legitimate. The admission prompted many Trump allies to vilify "60 Minutes" and Stahl to this day.

The ordeal has continued to haunt "60 Minutes." The long-running CBS program recently suggested Trump wouldn’t appear on the show for another interview without an apology regarding the Stahl interview.

Graham believes "60 Minutes" should admit that Stahl was wrong when she insisted the laptop couldn’t be verified.

"CBS never followed up or apologized. Because they're shamelessly partisan," Graham said.

CBS NEWS VERIFIES HUNTER BIDEN’S SCANDALOUS LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER DISMISSING IT

DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall believes the laptop ordeal is one of the reasons why news consumers around the nation have so little confidence in the media these days.

"In retrospect, it is clear now that the establishment media tried to impact the 2020 election by consciously omitting coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop story," McCall told Fox News Digital.

He noted that the "minimal coverage" it received focused on the former intelligence officials who falsely claimed the laptop was bogus.

"So, we had the almost unbelievable situation in which the mainstream media dismissed something that was true, yet promoted something that was false. And these decisions were not just mistakes that can occasionally happen in journalism. They were intentional decisions to alter the public sphere for political purposes," McCall said.

"Sadly, the establishment media continue to want to be political activists in the 2024 election cycle. The performances of network debate moderators demonstrate the activist mindset of these news organizations," he continued. "The ongoing coverup of Biden's cognitive decline earlier this year can now be viewed as journalistic malpractice. CBS' controversial editing of Harris' ‘60 Minutes’ interview is yet another indication of the media's manipulation of election narratives."

Morris, who knew the laptop was authentic from the jump when she broke the story in the first place, thinks many Americans still believe the debunked narratives.

"There are Americans who are so propagandized by a media that is so corrupt… I think that there are still some people who, unfortunately, never really got the memo," she said.

A McDonald’s employee in Georgia appears to have mistaken former President Bill Clinton, 78, for President Joe Biden, 81, when he dropped by while rallying support for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign, video posted Sunday shows.

Clinton, wearing a baseball jacket with “USA” emblazoned on its back, exchanged greetings with the employee, the video shows. The employee is seen giving Clinton a quizzical look and expectantly asks, while shaking hands with him, “You Joe? Mr. Joe?”

Someone not in the field of view clarified it was Clinton. The employee then exclaims, “Oh! I gotta hug you!” and ran around the counter to hug the forty-second president of the United States. Other employees appeared similarly surprised before taking photos of their colleague with Clinton.

The video appears to have been originally posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) by Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña.

“The boss was stumping for @KamalaHarris in Georgia and had to stop by the old stomping grounds, @McDonalds,” Ureña wrote. (RELATED: Donald Trump Makes Epic Game Day Request)

Clinton’s love for McDonald’s is well-known. Clinton himself joked about it during his Aug. 21 speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, saying, “I’ll be so happy when [Harris] actually enters the White House because she will break my record as the president who has spent the most time at McDonald’s.”

Clinton so frequented a McDonald’s in Little Rock, Arkansas while he was the state’s governor that the establishment bears a plaque commemorating his visits, NBC 5 Chicago reported.

Clinton made the visits during his morning runs while serving as governor and during his 1992 presidential campaign, the plaque claims.

“Thank you for your business, Mr. President,” the plaque, dedicated in 2019, read.

A 1992 “Saturday Night Live” sketch shows the late comedian Phil Hartman playing a gregarious Clinton stopping by a McDonald’s while on a jog.

“Let me tell you something, there’s gonna be a whole bunch of things we don’t tell Mrs. Clinton. Fast food is the least of our worries, okay, buddy?” Hartman’s portrayal of Clinton laughingly tells a member of his security detail, played by Kevin Nealon, who expresses concern the visit would be disapproved by the former first lady.

A Sept. 6, 2004 quadruple-bypass surgery following heart problems forced the then-58-year-old Clinton to replace his McDonald’s staples with a vegan diet, according to The Washington Post.

Both Harris and 2024 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have repeatedly talked up their associations with McDonald’s during their ongoing campaigns, Yahoo Finance reported.
Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down on her recognition of Indigenous Peoples' Day amid outrage on social media over her unearthed support of renaming Columbus Day.

"This Indigenous Peoples’ Day, I am thinking about the young Indigenous leaders I met in Arizona last week. I am counting on their leadership and looking forward to our partnership," Harris posted to her campaign X account late Monday afternoon.

The post comes as videos of Harris from both 2019 and 2021 have spread like wildfire across social media platforms, spotlighting Harris' previous comments supporting the renaming of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and admonishing European explorers for unleashing a "wave of devastation for Tribal nations" when they reached the Americas in the late 1400s.

"Count me in on support," Harris told a voter in New Hampshire in 2019 when asked if she supports renaming Columbus Day "Indigenous People’s Day," footage of the event shows. Harris' remarks came roughly a month after she launched her ultimately failed 2020 run for the White House.

COLUMBUS DAY FLASHBACK: HARRIS EXCORIATED EUROPEAN EXPLORERS FOR 'WAVE OF DEVASTATION' TO NATIVE PEOPLES

The Trump campaign slammed Harris over her unearthed comments in 2019, in an exclusive comment to Fox News Digital on Sunday.

TRUMP CAMP RIPS HARRIS OVER UNEARTHED COMMENTS ON RENAMING COLUMBUS DAY: 'STEREOTYPICAL LEFTIST'

"Kamala Harris is your stereotypical leftist. Not only does she want to raise taxes and defund the police — she also wants to cancel American traditions like Columbus Day," Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

"President Trump will make sure Christopher Columbus’ great legacy is honored and protect this holiday from radical leftists who want to erase our nation’s history like Kamala Harris."

DEFACED COLUMBUS STATUE THAT WAS THROWN INTO A VIRGINIA POND FINDS MORE WELCOMING HOME IN NYC SUBURB

Back in 2021, Harris said as vice president that the U.S. "must not shy away" from its "shameful past" of European explorers who she said ushered "in a wave of devastation."

"Since 1934, every October, the United States has recognized the voyage of the European explorers who first landed on the shores of the Americas," Harris said during the National Congress of American Indians' 78th Annual Convention on Oct. 12, 2021.

"But that is not the whole story. That has never been the whole story," Harris continued in her 2021 speech.

"Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for Tribal nations — perpetrating violence, stealing land and spreading disease," she continued. "We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on Native communities today."

Columbus Day is a federal holiday that officially celebrates and recognizes Italian explorer Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas in 1492. Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed a proclamation in 1934 making Columbus Day a national holiday following lobbying from the Italian American and Catholic communities.

Activists in recent years have worked to disassociate the day from Columbus, claiming it celebrates colonialism and genocide of indigenous people, in favor of celebrating Native Americans. Activists have also worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020.

President Biden became the first president in 2021 to formally recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day on the same holiday.

Harris has consistently celebrated Indigenous Peoples' Day over Columbus Day, with her official vice presidential X account acknowledging the holiday each year since 2021, while searching for "Columbus Day" on her account turns up no results.

Harris cited recent legislation she helped author that makes lynching a federal crime as she delivered her response to the New Hampshire voter.

"People did not want to deal and accept and most importantly admit that we are the scene of a crime when it comes to what we did with slavery and Jim Crow and institutionalized racism in this country, and we have to be honest about that," she said, the Washington Times reported in 2019. "If we are not honest, we are not going to deal with the vestiges of all of that harm, and we are not going to correct course, and we are not going to be true to our values and morals."

"Similarly, when it comes to indigenous Americans, the indigenous people, there is a lot of work that we still have to do, and I appreciate and applaud your point and your effort, and count me in on support," she said, marking her support of renaming the holiday.

Activists have also worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020.
Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz broke the first rule of the Harris-Walz campaign: He told the truth about a policy objective.

Speaking last Tuesday to California Democrats, Walz said: “The Electoral College needs to go. We need a national popular vote.” Earlier that day, in Seattle, he had called himself “a national popular vote guy.”

Walz’s moment of clarity sent the campaign into crisis mode, with spokesman Teddy Tschann insisting: “Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College.” The New York Times noted that Kamala Harris was previously “open” to ending the Electoral College but that, “during this campaign, she has avoided taking ambitious positions of the type that would upend the American political system.”

Yet, Walz’s record speaks for itself. Just last year, as governor of Minnesota, he signed legislation that included the National Popular Vote interstate compact, a measure that is designed to nullify the Electoral College.

The NPV compact changes how states choose presidential electors, basing it on the nationwide popular vote, not the popular vote in each state. The goal is to force the Electoral College to rubber stamp the national popular vote result.

Minnesota was the 16th state to join the compact when Walz signed it last year, and Maine became the 17th this year. Other states in the anti-Electoral College club include New York, Illinois, and — of course — California.

The NPV compact has a “trigger” — it takes effect if joined by states that together control at least 270 electoral votes. States currently in the compact have 209 electoral votes. If a few more join, 2024 could be the last election where the Electoral College functions as intended.

Abolishing the Electoral College would be a disaster, but Walz’s underhanded plan is especially dangerous. Amending the Constitution is a multi-step process that requires supermajorities in both Congress and the states. The NPV compact could take effect if passed by fewer than half the states.

The NPV compact raises basic questions: Is it fair to combine popular votes from states with very different election processes? What if a state fails to finish counting all its votes on time? How would a nationwide recount work? What about the conflict between ranked-choice voting and NPV? (RELATED: TRENT ENGLAND: Billionaires Push Ranked-Choice Voting Schemes)

Today, each state runs its own election, which means that the results of flawed policies and other election problems are contained within each state. Vermont allows felons to vote from prison, but this only affects the outcome in Vermont. If California lowers the voting age or looks the other way when foreign citizens cast ballots, that only affects the outcome in California.

Walz’s NPV plan would reward states for dubious policies and even illegal election practices by adding those votes into a nationwide total that would — for the first time — control the outcome.

The Electoral College brings checks and balances to presidential elections. While larger states have more electoral votes, there is a limit to how much power they get relative to smaller states. This check on big state power creates more political balance, forcing each major political party to reach out beyond its base.

Because of the Electoral College, Democrats must appeal to voters in places like rural Pennsylvania and small-town Wisconsin. Hence, Harris claims to love fracking, guns and hunting. An emblem for this might be the Harris-Walz campaign’s camouflage hat, which features in Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s bizarre Doritos video.

This helps make sense of Walz’s comments, and the campaign’s rush to cover them up. Walz was telling his California donors that he would like to change the rules to spend more time with them and less time with those other Americans, the people who really do own guns, hunt and understand that it takes fossil fuels to power the American economy.

While politicians like Walz might benefit from the National Popular Vote scheme, voters would be the losers. All Americans are better off with the Electoral College’s checks and balances helping to protect our elections and force both parties to build bigger, broader coalitions. State legislatures should reject the NPV compact, and states — like Minnesota — that have joined it should repeal it.

Reagan star Dennis Quaid called on America to “pick a side” in November and questioned whether the United States was “going to be a nation of law and order or wide open borders.” During Donald Trump’s rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday, Quaid spoke about how “the issues of the 1980” presidential election between former President Ronald Reagan and former President Jimmy Carter are “similar to what they are today.”

“I’m here today to tell you that it’s time to pick a side,” Quaid said to the thousands of rally goers. “Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution or for TikTok? Are we going to be a nation of law and order or wide open borders? Which is it, because it’s time to pick a side.”

“You know I’m an actor and I just had this movie come out — it was famous last name Reagan,” Quaid continued. “My favorite president of the 20th Century. It’s amazing how the issues of the 1980 election are very similar to what they are today. I don’t know if those of you who are of a certain age here remember the inflation that was going on back then. Twenty percent interest on a bank loan, we had Iran hostages, we were a nation in decline — that’s what they told us. Ronald Reagan came along and said, “No, we’re not a nation in decline. We’re going there,” and we followed him. The same with Trump, with President Trump, my favorite president of the 21st Century.”

Quaid starred in the film, Reagan, as the 40th president of the United States. The film, which was released in cinemas on August 30, 2024, received a “98 percent audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes,” as well as an “A” on CinemaScore.

During an interview with Joe Rogan in August, Quaid revealed that while he “would cringe at so much stuff” Trump said, he felt the former president’s “heart was really in the right place” and added that the nation needed “a really strong leader” like Trump.

The actor has also previously indicated that he would be voting for Trump in the upcoming presidential election, noting that he saw “a weaponization of the justice system” taking place.

“I think I’m going to vote for him in the next election — yes, I am,” Quaid said. “I was ready not to vote for Trump until I saw what is, more than politics, I see a weaponization of the justice system and a challenge to our Constitution.”
Despite continually disparaging anyone who questioned election outcomes, Rep. Jamie Raskin and a few of his colleagues told Axios they can’t say with certainty whether they will certify the results if former President Donald Trump wins the 2024 election.

Raskin told Axios in an interview that he would “obviously accept” the results of the election if it were a “free, fair and honest election.” But he then claimed that he “definitely” does not take for granted that Trump will, as described by Axios, “use free, fair and honest means to secure a victory.”

Raskin also told Axios that Trump “is doing whatever he can to try to interfere with the process, whether we’re talking about manipulating electoral college counts in Nebraska or manipulating vote count in Georgia or imposing other kinds of impediments.”

For years, Raskin and his fellow Democrats have continually labeled Trump and anyone who questioned the results of the 2020 election a “threat to democracy” and an “insurrectionist,” but Raskin’s comments signal that the whole “denying election results is a threat to democracy” schtick may be falling by the wayside.

Raskin wasn’t alone in his election denialism, with Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who objected to the 2005 electors for George W. Bush, saying she doesn’t trust Trump and that “we would have to, in any election … make sure that all the rules have been followed.”

House Rules Committee Ranking Member Jim McGovern (who objected to Trump electors in 2017), told Axios Democrats would certify a Trump win “assuming everything goes the way we expect it to.”

“We have to see how it all happens,” McGovern told Axios, adding that he expects Democrats “would” certify the results.

Election denialism is nothing new for Democrats. In fact, their performative Jan. 6 Committee appointed Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson as chairman — but Thompson denied the results of the 2004 election and voted against the Ohio certification of Bush’s win. Raskin himself challenged the certification of Trump’s victory in 2017, arguing that “10 of the 29 electoral votes cast by Florida were cast by electors not lawfully certified because they violated Florida’s prohibition against dual officeholders.”

Despite their own election denialism, Democrats have resorted to lawfare and bullying to force Republicans into relinquishing their right to question problematic election administration.

Attorney General Merrick Garland recently boasted that his office has prosecuted nearly 1,500 Americans for protesting the 2020 election and warned others they will face similar lawfare should they dare question the administration of the upcoming election.

Meanwhile Republicans who question the conduct of questionable election practices are smeared by the propaganda press and their Democrat allies as election “deniers.” It’s a tactic designed to silence legitimate concerns about election administration.

Surely if Democrats have legitimate cause for concern about the integrity of an election they reserve the right to question the administration, but if they were legitimately concerned about “free” and “fair” elections, they’d be sounding the alarm about unsafe election practices right now.

Consider, for example, that the Georgia State Election Board found in May that Fulton County double-scanned more than 3,000 ballots during the 2020 presidential recount. In the wake of finding such insecure election practices, the State Election Board passed a series of rules designed to ensure that ballot counts are accurate before certification. Except Democrats, backed by Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, have sued the board because of the new rules. If Raskin is so deeply concerned about “fair” elections, surely he would defend the state board’s efforts to ensure that all legitimate votes are counted, right?

Wrong. Instead, Raskin smeared the Georgia process while speaking to Axios.

“[Trump] is doing whatever he can to … [manipulate] vote count in Georgia,” Raskin reportedly said.

It’s because Raskin doesn’t actually care about free and fair election practices. He simply cares about denying Trump a potential second term — all the while serving on a committee that sought to have people jailed for doing less than what Raskin tells Axios he might do should Trump win this November.

The Biden-Harris administration announced it would not be extending parole for the hundreds of thousands of non-citizens enrolled in a hotly debated migrant flight program, but border hawks say the tough declaration likely won’t lead to any of them being removed from the country.

The migrants who entered the United States on two-year parole via the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan (CHNV) program will not see their status renewed when it ends, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation. In a statement, DHS warned that those who do not find other immigration arrangements or leave the country on their volition would be at risk of deportation. (RELATED: Reporter Questions Mayorkas About Afghan Arrested Over Alleged Election Day Terror Plot)

“Those who do not have pending immigration benefits or who have not been granted an immigration benefit during their two-year parole period will need to depart the United States prior to the expiration of their authorized parole period or may be placed in removal proceedings after the period of parole expires,” a DHS spokesperson stated to the DCNF.

The decision — which appears to be the latest shift to the right on immigration enforcement from the administration — could put in limbo the status of the roughly 530,000 foreign nationals who entered the U.S. via the program. However, border hawks say the tough talk will not actually lead to any widespread enforcement.

“I guess they’re figuring they are going to put the onus on whoever is in [the White House] to remove the people here, and history would show that a lot of times — particularly if they’re working and they have children — they’re going to remain permanently, whether they have status or not,” said Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organization that advocates for lower levels of immigration into the U.S. “There will be an expectation that Congress will eventually amnesty them.”

“Yes, they might be ending these programs, but they’re not doing anything to remove these people from the United States,” Ruark continued.

First launched for Venezuelans in October 2022, CHNV was later expanded in January 2023 to include Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians. The parole program gives foreign nationals authorization into the U.S. and work permits for a two-year time period, provided they have not previously entered the country illegally and passed other vetting processes.

Over 110,000 Cubans, more than 210,000 Haitians, nearly 93,000 Nicaraguans and nearly 117,000 Venezuelans have been granted parole under the program and flown into the U.S., according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP). About 30,000 enrollees were entering the country every month.

CHNV was placed on pause in August upon the discovery of massive fraud within the program. An internal DHS audit — parts of it which were leaked to the public — discovered incredible amounts of discrepancies among applicants, such as 100,948 CHNV forms being completed by just 3,218 sponsors, 24 of the 1,000 most used Social Security numbers by sponsors belonging to a deceased person and an IP address located in Tijuana, Mexico, being used more than 1,300 times, among other red flags.

Despite the severe level of fraud uncovered, DHS resumed CNHV in August, just a few weeks after confirming it was placed on hold.

“I was not surprised by the amount of fraud,” Ruark said. “I do think that had a lot to do with why they ended the program because they don’t want it to be continued when you have a new administration coming in who can show how much fraud and abuse there was in the system.”

“Or if you have more congressional oversight looking into these programs, they could say ‘well we ended these programs’ and so you don’t have to have all that public scrutiny or exposure,” Ruark went on.

Other critics of the parole program, such as House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, say it has simply served as a means to allow otherwise-inadmissible aliens into the country en masse. The Republican congressman was also skeptical that the end of their CHNV parole would mean they’d be leaving the U.S.

“This move is yet another optics-driven smokescreen from the Biden-Harris administration,” Green stated. “There are numerous other ways these inadmissible aliens could be — and likely will be — allowed to stay, including through applying for asylum or Temporary Protected Status.”

“Even if they don’t, however, given [Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s] low enforcement rates under this administration, most simply will not be priorities for removal,” he continued.

In their statement confirming CHNV parole would not be renewed, DHS did suggest those enrolled in the program could “seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible.” Additionally, the latest ICE data shows enforcement actions by the agency have dropped considerably since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, drawing to question whether a Harris administration would crack down on former CHNV parolees remaining in the U.S. unlawfully.

There were a total of 273,708 deportations of illegal migrants during the first three fiscal years of the Biden-Harris administration, which includes removals from ICE officers and other federal immigration agents, according to data compiled by the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE). This number marks a considerable drop from the 749,462 deportations that took place during the first three fiscal years under the Trump administration.

“Overall, convicted criminal alien removals have decreased by 74%, completely undercutting the assertion by Kamala Harris that ICE has merely increased its focus on criminal aliens,” NICE’s report stated. “In fact, her policies have ensured that most illegal aliens can remain in the country indefinitely — even those who have committed a crime.”

After presiding over an historic level of illegal immigration into the country, the Biden-Harris administration has appeared to moderate its agenda on border enforcement in the run-up to the presidential elections.

President Joe Biden in June announced an executive order that essentially shut down the U.S.-Mexico border until the number of daily illegal encounters falls below a certain threshold. He doubled down on this policy in September by extending the timeline it would take for the order to be deactivated, essentially ensuring it would remain in place throughout the remaining days of the presidential election.

The administration’s decision to not renew parole for CHNV enrollees appeared to be the latest act of an immigration crackdown. Ruark, however, said the move is meaningless without deportations taking place.

“If they wanted to do a dog and pony show to demonstrate that they are tough, they would make a big deal about removing violent criminal aliens, but they aren’t even doing that,” Ruark said.

Black conservative men have responded to former President Barack Obama’s claims that they do not support Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign due to sexism, slamming him for not accurately representing the black community and for trying to shame them into supporting Democrats.

During a Thursday event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Obama made several controversial remarks accusing black male voters of not being onboard with Harris for president.

Complaining that Harris has not seen the same levels of support that he did when he ran for president in 2008, Obama told a group of black men that it “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers”:

According to the former president, the choice for black men to support Harris is “clear” because she “grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences.”

Obama’s controversial speech, made to a small group of voters in a surprise stop to a local Harris campaign office, continued on to say it is “not acceptable” to support Trump.

“You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down?” he said, according to CNN. “That’s not acceptable.”

The “excuses” to not vote for Harris boils down to being anti-women, he argued.

“You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that,” Obama continued. “Because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.”

His remarks went viral on social media — but not for positive reasons.

Black support for Harris is lower than it was for either Democrat nominee in the 2016 and 2020 elections, the New York Times revealed in a new poll.

Only 78 percent of black voters are supporting Harris at this point in the election cycle, compared to 90 percent for Biden in 2020 and 92 percent for Hillary Clinton in 2016, the data showed when published Saturday.

While just 15 percent of black voters said they are supporting Trump in the upcoming election, that is a significant increase from 9 percent and 7 percent in the last two elections, respectively — and the majority of those black Trump supporters are men.

Former Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones (R) called Harris “Madam Lock Up A Brother” and demanded an apology from Obama to black men, “effective immediately”:

“For him to want to come down from his mansion in Martha’s Vineyard and tell black men how we should vote … Really?” Jones said in a video posted to X.

“You don’t even live in Chicago anymore. You left your black community, Barack Obama. You want to tell us how to vote? We’re not having that, and we’re not voting for Kamala Harris,” Jones added.

CJ Pearson, co-chair of the GOP’s Youth Advisory Council, said “we don’t give a damn about what Barack Obama has to say”:

“Barack Obama … believes that black men should set aside our disagreements, set aside our grievances and just ‘take one for the team,’” the young conservative activist, 22, said in an X video.

“Barack, we’ve been ‘taking one for the team,’ when it comes to supporting the Democrat Party, for decades. And what do we have to show for it? Our inner cities are destroyed, violent crime is up, we are living in poverty in far too many communities across this country,” Pearson argued.

Conservative media personality Rob Smith also roasted Obama’s words, saying he will not be bullied into supporting Harris:

“Sorry, Obama, I’m a black man, and I’m voting for Donald Trump for president, and there’s no amount of lecturing, or bullying or shaming that you can do, that is going to make me change that decision,” Smith said in another video posted to X.

“You may be the surrogate black dad for a lot of fatherless black boys that are running around this country, but I’ve got a dad, I know who he is, and it ain’t you,” he added.

Political analyst and author Boyce Watkins also compared Obama to a “deadbeat dad.”

“Barack Obama lecturing black men is like a deadbeat dad not speaking to his kids for a decade and then showing up like he has some kind of authority,” he wrote:

“Dear Barack Obama, I’m a proud Black man, and I am not voting for Kamala Harris,” said former Florida Republican congressional candidate Willie Montague:

Many other social media users chimed in, with posts saying they are “tired of Barack Obama lecturing Black men” garnering thousands of likes and views:

“Obama’s pitch to Black men to support Kamala because ‘grew up like us’ is comical. She didn’t grow up like us and neither did Obama,” another black poster said:
Panelists on CNN clashed Sunday immediately after GOP strategist and senior political commentator David Urban called out Vice President Kamala Harris for having a “terrible” week.

Despite Harris having a full week of sit-down interviews with the media, polls have shown former President Donald Trump and Harris nearly deadlocked in key swing states. On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Urban criticized Harris’ week, noting how fellow lawmakers, like Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, received major backlash online after releasing an unusual, staged video with MSNBC columnist Liz Plank.

“She had a terrible week. It was a terrible week for the Harris campaign. You had Gretchen Whitmer having to apologize to Catholics across America for mocking them with some Dorito, bizarro Dorito thing on there. You had governor Elmer Fudd out hunting and not knowing how to load his shotgun using the wrong gun, at the same time — ” Urban said.

“At the same time, you have Barack Obama in Pennsylvania where he derided people who own guns. Remember? Claiming people in Pennsylvania were bitter and they cling to guns and religion,” Urban continued. “Remember that in 2008? So they’re trying to appeal to those folks at the same time while he alienates black male voters by chastising. So they had a really tough week.”

However, Democratic strategist Doug Thornell intervened and pushed back against Urban, criticizing Trump’s performance and noting that Harris’ positive for the week was releasing her medical records. (RELATED: Obama Scolds Black Men Who Aren’t Supporting Harris)

“So first of all, Kamala Harris released her medical records, Trump hasn’t. That was this week,” Doug Thornell said. “He goes to Detroit and insults an entire city and insults a lot of black people there. His economic plan came out and by outside economic analysis, they said it would raise costs and raise debt on the American people. So Trump didn’t really have a great week either. I think many times he goes out there — ”

“[Releasing] medical records, that’s the high point of your week? You’re really grasping at straws,” Urban interrupted.

WATCH:

Thornell continued to push back against Urban, questioning whether Pennsylvania voters still remember former President Barack Obama’s 2008 comment to them, before CNN’s Scott Jennings joined the argument.

“I don’t think if I were in your party, with all due respect, I wouldn’t want to be arguing about the hiding of medical conditions and medical records, given who the current president of the United States is,” Jennings hit back.

While Thornell criticized Trump in response, Jennings asked to finish his statement and continued to call out Harris for dropping poll numbers.

“Number two, I think the polling this morning and the week, I think David’s right. It was a rough week. I mean, her faves are down. They’re struggling with — I mean, the front page of The New York Times this morning, front-page story, Democrats struggling with African American voters, particularly African American men,” Jennings said.

“This gender gap issue is real. It’s a real problem and you see the Democrats reacting to it. I think what they are now finally in October — the election — coming to realize is that a lot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than dudes who just want to be dudes. No hunting, cosplay or cringey videos is going to change it — the bed is made,” Jennings concluded.

NBC News’ latest national poll shows Harris and Trump in a deadlock just three weeks before Election Day, with each receiving 48% support.

In recent weeks, political pundits have warned the Democratic Party about the former president’s appeal to key Democratic voting blocs. The latest New York Times poll, released Sunday, shows Harris trailing by six points among Hispanic voters compared to President Joe Biden’s 2020 election results. The former president has also gained support among black voters, with New York Times polling data showing him receiving 15% support, up from 9% in 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas stated Sunday on CBS News that his agency is doing “everything” they can to fight migrant gangs in the U.S., just before being pressed on an Afghan migrant allegedly planning a terrorist attack.

Federal authorities announced the arrest of 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi on Oct. 8 for allegedly planning a terrorist attack in the U.S. on Election Day after he entered the country in September 2021 through a humanitarian parole during the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul under the Biden-Harris administration. On “Face the Nation,” host Margaret Brennan questioned Mayorkas about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, citing former President Donald Trump’s comments about deporting the group and asking if Mayorkas is doing enough to combat the gang.

“Yes, we are and I think you’re speaking of Tren de Aragua, TDA. Margaret, I was a prosecutor for 12 years. We had criminal gangs to battle back then. We are indeed doing everything we can to dismantle criminal gangs and transnational criminal organizations. Quite frankly we’ve devoted an unprecedented level of resources and personnel and focus to this effort. This is not a new phenomenon, but we are bringing new tools, new capabilities and new resources to the fight,” Mayorkas said.

“Can you quickly explain what the status is with this arrest this past week — or this prosecution we learned of this past week — of this Afghan national who was apparently planning an Election Day terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS. He was in this country. He had immigration status. Was he radicalized before he came to the United States?” Brennan pressed back.

The DHS approved Tawhedi’s humanitarian parole, which would have him held in a third country to be screened and vetted, in 2021 and immediately applied for a special immigration visa (SIV) after entering the U.S., according to Fox News. It is unclear when the 27-year-old’s SIV was approved, however, officials told the outlet there were no red flags that would’ve prohibited him from the U.S.

Mayorkas stated that due to it being an “ongoing prosecution” he wouldn’t be able to speak on the “facts,” but hoped the public would understand what the agency is dealing with. (RELATED: ‘Do You Hear Yourself?’: JD Vance Stunned After Raddatz Minimizes Migrant Gang Takeover Of Apartment Complexes)

WATCH:

“So Margaret, it is an ongoing prosecution, so I won’t speak of the facts. But the viewing public is getting an idea of the breadth and diversity of the missions that we in the Department of Homeland Security tackle – ” Mayorkas said.

Brennan followed up by focusing on “vetting versus whether he was radicalized here,” prompting Mayorkas to defend the agency’s vetting process.

“Remember, the individual came through parole, an Afghan national. When we vet, and we do so intensively – when we vet an individual, it’s a point in time screening and vetting process. If we obtain information subsequently that suggests the individual could be of danger, we take appropriate law enforcement action. That’s exactly what we did in this case,” Mayorkas responded.

While border crossings have dropped to their lowest levels since President Joe Biden’s June immigration executive order, illegal crossings under the Trump administration were still significantly lower than under the Biden-Harris administration. By the end of Trump’s term, illegal border crossings totaled around two million, while Biden averaged two million per year from 2021 to 2023, according to the Washington Post.

The Tren de Aragua gang made headlines in September after reports indicated the group had “taken over” multiple apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado, according to property managers cited by the Denver Post. Despite claims by the city’s Republican mayor and Democratic Gov. Jared Polis that the issue was exaggerated, authorities confirmed in mid-September that ten gang members had been living in the city and were “committing acts of violence against members of the migrant community,” according to FOX 31.

The Biden-Harris administration has aggressively pursued litigation against red states as a means of advancing its agenda, which legal experts said could infringe on states’ rights.

States such as Texas, which have taken steps to limit the surge of illegal migrants — reaching record levels under the Biden administration — are now facing lawsuits from the federal government. Similarly, states that passed laws contradicting the Biden administration’s positions on issues like abortion and gender have faced lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the bills.

The amount of lawsuits the Biden administration has filed is “unprecedented,” Hans​​​​ von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“And all of them are examples of the DOJ abusing its law enforcement power and infringing on federalism by going after the states,” he said.

The DOJ sued Virginia on Friday over an initiative intended to remove non-citizens from the voter rolls “too close” to the election. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin called it a “desperate attempt to attack the legitimacy” of the state’s elections.

“With less than 30 days until the election, the Biden-Harris Department of Justice is filing an unprecedented lawsuit against me and the Commonwealth of Virginia, for appropriately enforcing a 2006 law signed by Democrat Tim Kaine that requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls — a process that starts with someone declaring themselves a non-citizen and then registering to vote,” Youngkin said in a statement.

The administration likewise targeted Alabama over an effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, who announced in August that 3,251 registered voters had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), noted the federal government repeatedly denied requests for a list of noncitizens residing in the state.

When the state decided to tackle the issue itself, it was promptly hit with a lawsuit. Removing voters from the state registration list within 90 days of an election violates federal law, the DOJ argued.

The Biden-Harris DOJ has launched an unprecedented assault against American voters. Just days before the election, they have sued the States of Alabama and Virginia to keep illegal aliens on the voter rolls. Every single American should be outraged. pic.twitter.com/kuzX1RNcDd — America First Legal (@America1stLegal) October 12, 2024



Other election litigation include the DOJ’s lawsuits against Arizona in July 2022 over a proof of citizenship voting law and Georgia in June 2021 over an election integrity law.

The Supreme Court allowed Arizona to partially enforce its law in August after the Republican National Committee (RNC) intervened in a separate lawsuit brought by a left-wing activist groups. While the high court rejected a ban on casting ballots for president without proof of citizenship, the majority allowed Arizona to reject state voter registration forms that lack it.

In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger suggested the DOJ may have coordinated with activists on the case, requesting documents related to the Department’s decision.

“Given that it is a felony under federal law for an alien to register or vote, DOJ should be applauding the states trying to do something about this problem and helping the states defend lawsuits filed against them instead of suing the states,” von Spakovsky told the DCNF, noting the same is true in the immigration space. “The federal government needs the assistance and help of state governments and state law enforcement to enforce our immigration laws and stop the unlawful flood of illegal aliens coming into the country.”

The Biden DOJ has also taken aggressive action against states attempting to crack down on illegal immigration. (RELATED: Supreme Court’s Coming Term To Feature Cases On Child Sex Change Bans, Guns And Porn)

It sued Texas in January over a state law that empowers local authorities to arrest migrants who enter illegally, followed by suing Iowa and Oklahoma in May over similar laws.

In 2012, the Supreme Court held that an Arizona law making it a crime to be in the state without authorization was preempted by federal law.

“There was very little chance of Oklahoma or Texas being successful without overturning Arizona v. US, and maybe that is their objective, but it is hardly improper for the federal government to enforce what the Supreme Court has said are unconstitutional laws infringing on the power of the federal government (however much I disagree with the opinion in Arizona v. United States),” Competitive Enterprise Institute attorney Devin Watkins told the DCNF. “The Supreme Court refused to block the Texas statute on an emergency basis, suggesting that it is at least possible that the Supreme Court may overturn Arizona v. US on appeal.”

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador accused the Biden administration of ignoring states’ rights when the DOJ brought a lawsuit challenging Idaho’s abortion ban to the Supreme Court.

The administration sued shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, alleging Idaho’s Defense of Life Act prevents doctors from performing abortions in emergency circumstances as they claim is required under federal law. The Supreme Court reinstated limits on the law in June, sending the case back to the lower court without deciding whether the statute conflicted with federal law.

Currently, the DOJ is fighting Tennessee’s ban on child sex change procedures for minors at the Supreme Court.

South Texas College of Law Houston professor Josh Blackman told the DCNF it looks like the Biden DOJ is “trying to initiate as many lawsuits as possible before the election.”

“If Trump wins, it will be hard for [the] DOJ to terminate pending cases,” Blackman said. “It is also possible private groups can move to intervene to keep the cases alive.”

Watkins disagreed that the Biden administration has pursued more litigation than usual, noting lawsuits over voting issues are “actually quite common due to the federal election issues at stake.” (RELATED: Free Speech May Be In The Crosshairs Under A Harris-Walz Administration)

“Overall, I don’t believe that the federal government appears to be filing lawsuits against states any more often during this administration than in previous administrations,” he said. “Some of this litigation could infringe on states’ rights if successful, and in many cases, the federal government should lose, but this litigation isn’t unusual.”

During the Trump administration, the government sued California for a cap and trade agreement with Quebec. It also sued California, New Jersey and King County, Washington, over sanctuary city policies.

“The Trump administration did other things to put pressure on states to change their laws, like the DHS’s suspension of NY’s access to the Global Entry program, or threatening federal payments to local jurisdictions,” Watkins added.

The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.

Former President Trump said the immigration crisis at the southern border is likely a "bigger deal" this election cycle than inflation and economic woes that have rocked voters in recent years, according to his exclusive interview with Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures."

"We have tremendous support. They're so tired of seeing what's happened to this country. They're so tired of seeing the incompetence, seeing the border. And I think the border is maybe a bigger deal than even inflation," Trump said during his interview with Fox News Business anchor Maria Bartiromo when asked about his message to undecided voters.

Trump joined Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday, just 22 days ahead of Election Day. Trump's interview was expansive, touching on topics such as taxes, tariffs he would level on foreign nations, his abortion stance, and foreign affairs, such as the ongoing war in Israel.

Illegal immigration via the nation's southern border grew to crisis levels under the Biden administration, with at least 7 million migrants coming into the nation in the last three and a half years.

"And inflation is a massive word. And the bad economy is, is massive. The inflation made the economy bad. It made it impossible for people. But I almost think that when they see millions of people coming into our country, 13,099 murderers, many of them murdered more than one person. When they see that, I actually think that that's, I think the border is a bigger issue than even the economy. Those are the two big issues," Trump continued in his interview.

Trump said that in addition to the border and inflation, the hurricanes that have devastated states such as North Carolina, Georgia and Florida – and the White House's response – will speak volumes to voters.

TRUMP: IF KAMALA BECOMES PRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE NO AUTO INDUSTRY

"The other issue that's really big, I think, is how badly they've done with North Carolina, parts of Georgia. When you look at what's happened, and Florida… You see what's happening there. I think we got a little bit lucky in the sense that it was bad, but it wasn't as bad as they thought," Trump said.

"The response from the White House has been absolutely terrible. Her response has been terrible, so bad that they didn't even want, I see [Gov. Ron DeSantis] didn't want her in Florida. They just don't even come here. So I, I think we're doing really well," he added.

Vice President Kamala Harris raised more than $1 billion in less than three months as a presidential candidate, the New York Times reported, citing "three people with knowledge of her fund-raising haul."

The Times added that Harris' fundraising haul for her candidacy is more than former President Donald Trump announced raising for his campaign.

"While other presidential candidates, together with their parties, have passed that threshold before, the sheer speed with which Ms. Harris and her affiliated party committees raised the sum is notable," the Times reported further.

POLITICO SAYS HARRIS IS RUNNING ON A 'DREAM ECONOMY' BUT VOTERS AREN'T NOTICING

"The federal reports detailing the fund-raising totals for September are required to be made public later this month," they reported.

The Times report comes after a new report showing Democrats sharing worry about the state of the 2024 presidential race and having "flashbacks to 2016."

Sources close to Harris' campaign reportedly told CNN that Democrats were panicked because polls have largely remained stagnant with less than four weeks to go until the election.

"People are nervous. They know the polls are tight," one source told CNN.

"A lot of us are having these flashbacks to 2016, too. We know when it can go the wrong way, and it can still feel fresh."

Furthermore, the latest Wall Street Journal poll found a small gap between Trump and Harris in seven battleground states, prompting a Democratic pollster to say that the 2024 election "really could not be closer."

Fox News Digital reported that the Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump leading Harris 46%-45%, with 93% of Democrats and Republicans across the seven states indicating their support for their parties’ respective candidates.

Harris has been on a media blitz recently by making appearances on ABC's The View and the popular podcast "Call Her Daddy." Harris also made appearances with radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night comic Stephen Colbert–all media outlets that have been friendly to her campaign and very critical of Trump.

The media blitz comes after the Harris campaign has avoided the media circuit since launching her campaign, prompting criticism from Republicans and voters–especially since many of Harris' past positions have been put in the spotlight since she ascended to the top of the ticket after President Biden withdrew from the presidential race.

Many called for transparency after Harris flip-flopped on several far-left policies when she ran for president in 2019, including fracking, decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, the Green New Deal, and getting rid of private health insurance.

The official union of the U.S. border patrol announced its full support of former President Trump during a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona on Sunday.

During the rally, Trump told the crowd that he was "honored to receive… the endorsement" of the union of the entire union of the border patrol agents, the National Border Patrol Council.

"It’s a great honor," Trump said. "They said it was unanimous. Thousands of people."

He then invited Paul Perez, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, onto the stage.

Perez said he had a message for everyone in the crowd.

"If we allow border czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell," Perez said. "The untold millions of people unvetted, who she has allowed into this country that are committing murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries and every other crime will continue to put our country in peril.

"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump," he continued. "He has always stood with the men and women who protect this border, who put their lives on the line for the country."

The union president told the crowd they have a choice to make this November.

He said the chaos can continue, and criminal cartels can continue to be allowed to control the border which will allow for drugs and fentanyl to filter into the U.S., or voters can put an end to the chaos.

"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States," Perez said.

Trump appeared pleased with the endorsement from what he called an "incredible group of people" he will always stand with.

After announcing the endorsement, Trump continued to rally for votes from the people of Arizona, a key swing state on the border.

He made numerous digs toward his opponent, Vice President Harris, and vowed to never allow the U.S. military to become woke.

Trump then told those in attendance to watch a video on a screen behind him.

The feed featured clips from Stanley Kubrick’s movie, "Full Metal Jacket," which features a brash drill sergeant played by the late actor, R. Lee Ermey.

Ermey’s character was featured shouting at his new soldiers, telling them they will not laugh or cry, before the video took a turn.

"Happy pride. Happy pride month, and actually, let’s declare it a sunny day," the video showed.

Trump also addressed the changing of the names of bases before later telling the crowd his administration will crush violent crime and support police.

Trump will continue to campaign up to election day on Nov. 5.

TRUMP, HARRIS LOCKED IN DEAD HEAT IN 7 BATTLEGROUND STATES, POLL FINDS: ‘COULD NOT BE CLOSER’

According to a Wall Street Journal poll released last week, there was little separation between Trump and Harris in seven battleground states, which prompted a Democratic pollster to say that the 2024 election "really could not be closer."

The survey of 600 registered voters in each of the states, which was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 8 with a margin of error of +/-4 percentage points, found that in a head-to-head contest, Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin.

Harris leads Trump 48%-46% in Arizona and Georgia, and 49%-47% in Michigan, according to the poll. In Nevada, Trump has his biggest swing state lead of 49%-43%, while he leads Harris in Pennsylvania 47%-46%, the poll also found.

On the issues, voters say they trusted Trump more to handle the economy, inflation and immigration and border security.

They preferred Harris when it comes to housing affordability, abortion, health care and having someone in the Oval Office who cares about you.

A Las Vegas man was arrested on Saturday at a checkpoint near former President Donald Trump’s Coachella, California, rally after being found with multiple guns, according to law enforcement officials.

In a press release on Sunday, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office revealed that Vem Miller, 49, “was found to be illegally in possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine.”

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told the Press-Telegram that “Miller presented fake VIP and press passes at the checkpoint.”

“We probably stopped another assassination attempt,” Bianco said.

After deputies who had been assigned to Trump’s Coachella came into contact with Miller, who was in a “black SUV at a checkpoint” near the rally, they discovered that he was reportedly illegally in possession of several handguns and was “taken into custody without incident,” according to the press release.

Miller was “later booked at the John J. Benoit Detention Center for possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine,” according to the press release.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told the Press-Telegram that “Miller presented fake VIP and press passes at the checkpoint.”

Fox News’s Bill Melugin said Sunday, “Sources close to the Trump campaign tell Fox News there was no assassination attempt against Trump at his Coachella, CA rally yesterday. We’re told a man with a gun was arrested at the perimeter of the event without incident.”

Trump faced a first assassination attempt at his Butler, Pennsylvania rally on July 13, 2024, when Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire from the rooftop of a nearby building where he had a direct line of sight of Trump. The former president was shot by a “bullet that pierced the upper part” of his right ear.

On September 15, 2024, Ryan Wesley Routh was apprehended after U.S. Secret Service agents saw the barrel of his AK-style rifle where he was hiding in the bushes near Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach where Trump had been playing golf.
Authorities arrested a Las Vegas resident Saturday at a checkpoint for former President Donald Trump’s rally in Coachella, California for allegedly possessing multiple illegal firearms, according to a press release.

Since the first assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 and the arrest of a second potential assassin on Sept. 15, the former president’s safety has been a top concern for lawmakers and the campaign. Riverside County Sheriff issued a statement announcing the arrest of 49-year-old Vem Miller who was found to be “illegally in possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine.”

Officials said Miller was arrested at 4:59 p.m. by deputies assigned to the rally at a checkpoint at Avenue 52 and Celebration Drive. Miller, driving a black SUV, was booked for “a loaded firearm” and “a high-capacity magazine,” according to the press release.

“This incident did not impact the safety of former President Trump or attendees of the event,” officials added.

Miller was confirmed to be released on $5,000 bail the same day and is scheduled to appear in court on January 2, 2025, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department inmate database.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco held a press conference Sunday afternoon, stating Miller first approached the outer perimeter and gave “all indications that he belonged there, that he was a participant who was allowed to enter into VIP in the press corps.” However, as Miller progressed, officials discovered the 49-year-old was driving an unregistered vehicle with a homemade license plate “indicative of a group of citizens that claim to be sovereign citizens,” along with multiple passports and driver’s licenses.

The Sovereign Citizen group believes that they are “not under the jurisdiction of the federal government and consider themselves exempt from U.S. law,” additionally the group uses a “variety of conspiracy theories and falsehoods to justify their beliefs and their activities, some of which are illegal and violent,” according to their website.

“The interior of the vehicle was in disarray. The vehicle had an obviously fake license plate, which prompted further investigation,” Bianco said. “During that investigation the deputy found multiple passports with multiple names, multiple driving license[s] with different names.”

While Bianco stated that Riverside officers “probably did” prevent a third assassination attempt, the Secret Service Chief of Communications posted a joint statement with the FBI noting that the investigation is ongoing but that the former president “was not in any danger.”

“The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI are aware of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office’s arrest on Saturday. The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Donald Trump was not in any danger,” the statement read.

“While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service, and FBI extend their gratitude to the deputies and local partners who helped ensure the safety of last night’s events,” the statement concluded.

In mid-September, Florida officials arrested 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh after a Secret Service agent spotted him in the bushes at Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach while the former president was playing the course. After firing shots at Routh, the 58-year-old fled, leaving behind an “AK-47 style rifle with a scope,” two backpacks, a GoPro and ceramic body armor plates, officials confirmed. (RELATED: Trump Campaign Requests Military Aircraft, Bulletproof Glass Amid Security Threats)

Routh was formally charged on Sept. 24 by federal prosecutors with attempting to assassinate a major political candidate, knowingly possessing a firearm and ammunition despite a previous conviction, possession of a firearm that had “the importer’s and manufacturer’s serial number removed, obliterated and altered,” and forcibly assaulting and interfering with a Secret Service special agent, according to court documents.

The arrest of Routh came after the July 13 assassination attempt against the former president by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who fired multiple rounds into Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. The attack killed former volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore, injured two supporters and injured Trump’s ear as well.

After his release, Miller reportedly denied the allegations, telling the Southern California News Group how he was “shocked” to have been arrested, noting he is a supporter of the former president, according to Fox News. Miller additionally claims that he was never told the reason behind his apprehension initially, and was allegedly only able to call a lawyer eight hours after his arrest, the outlet reported.

“These accusations are complete bullshit,” Miller said, according to Fox News. “I’m an artist, I’m the last person that would cause any violence and harm to anybody.”

Trump Campaign’s Communications Director Steven Cheung confirmed Sunday that the team was “monitoring the situation and gathering more information,” thanking law enforcement for their involvement.

“We thank law enforcement for securing the rally site and helping ensure the safety of President Trump. We are aware of news reports about the arrest and are currently monitoring the situation and gathering more information,” Cheung wrote.

Actress and Kamala Harris presidential campaign celebrity surrogate Jennifer Garner questioned if there was “anything sexier than a man” for Kamala during a Harris-Walz campaign rally in in the all-important swing state of Pennsylvania.

During the rally from Lancaster County on Friday, Garner, who is known for her roles in the television show Alias and the film, 13 Going On 30, acknowledged that the crowd had been door-knocking and making phone calls, and was “worn out,” adding that they were “the front lines.”

“Listen, I know you’ve knocked and knocked, and I know you’ve called and called,” Garner said. “I know you’ve given and given, and you’re worn out. But, the truth is, you are the front lines – this is it. I mean, I’m looking at these beautiful faces, these women and these strong men. God, is there anything sexier than a man who is like, men for Kamala?”

“You are the front line of this battle,” Garner added. “For a lack of a better word, it really is. There are two ways forward, and you guys are going to have a huge voice in how that way is chosen.”

A recent InsiderAdvantage poll conducted between October 7-8, 2024, found that former President Donald Trump was leading Harris in Pennsylvania by two points, 49 percent to 47 percent.

In a poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports and the American Thinker between September 19-22, 2024, Trump and Harris were found to be in a tie with 48 percent among likely voters in the state.
"Reagan" movie star Dennis Quaid rallied for former President Trump in Coachella, California, on Saturday, addressing a crowd in the deep blue state that was once Vice President Harris' turf.



"God bless you. God bless America. I'm here today to tell you that it's time to pick a side," Quaid said on stage. "Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution? Or for TikTok? Are we going to be a nation of law and order? Or wide open borders? Which is it? Because it's time to pick a side."

Speaking in the desert city east of Los Angeles known for its namesake annual music festival, Quaid said he played President Ronald Reagan, his "favorite president of the 20th century," in the 2024 biopic. The actor drew parallels between the political landscape when Reagan was first elected and the present.

"It's amazing how the issues of the 1980 election are very similar to what they are today," he said, recalling the record high inflation back then, as well as the Iran hostages.

TRUMP TAKES DETOUR TO ULTRA-BLUE CALIFORNIA TO SPOTLIGHT HARRIS' HOME TURF'S FAILED POLICIES: 'PARADISE LOST'

"We were a nation in decline. That's what they told us. Ronald Reagan came along and said, no, we're not a nation in decline. We're going there. And we followed him," Quaid said, pointing upwards. "The same with Trump, with President Trump. My favorite president of the 21st century."

The actor said that when he voted for Reagan decades ago, he went home to his roommate in Los Angeles at the time, who asked him who he voted for and told Quaid, "You are kicked out of the hippies."

"I'm gonna ask you a question that Reagan asked America back then, and I think it's the question that got him elected. Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Quaid said.

"Four years ago, under President Trump, we had energy," he said. "We were an energy independent nation. We had cheap gas. We were actually exporting oil to our allies and our friends. Today, Putin is making money hand over fist, selling oil that he uses to pay for his Soviet-style comeback war that he has with Ukraine, and while we're shutting down our pipelines over here and capping our wells, and begging Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to ‘pretty please, will you please sell us some oil? We're kind of short right now.'"

WHY TRUMP IS HEADED INTO ‘THE BELLY OF THE BEAST’: THE STRATEGY BEHIND HIS BLUE STATE STOPS

When Trump left office, Quaid said, inflation was low and there was "peace in the Middle East," crediting Trump as having been "right on the verge of accomplishing the Abraham Accords," making peace between Israel and Arab nations. The actor also said Trump was negotiating a withdrawal from Afghanistan with "honor and order," recalling how the former Republican president said he threatened a Taliban leader with a satellite image of his house.

"Iran was bankrupt," Quaid continued. "They weren't able to give weapons to Hamas and Hezbollah. And look at where we are today. We basically funded that war. Four years ago, we had a secure border. We were on our way to even doing more and having a wall. That's what a nation is. It has a wall.… But I guess it's like voter I.D. you don't need it in this country for some reason."

The actor concluded with a personal story about his housekeeper, Josie, who he said was in the United States illegally for more than a decade and used her sister's identification. When Trump was elected in 2016, Quaid said the housekeeper from Mexico "was in fear that she was going to be sent back to her country."

"I told her, I said, 'Josie, no, you're not. That's not what he's talking about. He wants people to come here the right way, I'm going to become your sponsor,'" he said. "And so we started it. Right now she has her green card today, and she so wants to get her citizenship before so she can vote for Donald Trump."

"So like I said, people, it's time to pick a side. Who are you going to pick? God bless you," Quaid added.
